# StickJS

### Intro

StickJS is a library for functional programming in JavaScript. It is
intended to be used in conjunction with the pipe operator `|>`, which is 
currently in the proposal stage (xxx link); or better yet, the bitwise-or 
('stick') operator `|`. This way you can start using it today in your 
projects using @xxx's babel-operator-overload, and the stick is more 
enjoyable to work with to boot. 
In addition to being fast and practical, it also introduces a new range of 
idioms and some conventions of its own. These may take some time to master, 
though people coming from a Lisp or Haskell background should hit the ground 
running. I hope to show you that it can improve both the quality of your 
code and your own enjoyment, and maybe clue you in to a new way to think 
about the whole business.
