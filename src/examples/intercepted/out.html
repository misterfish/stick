Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald and Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed join Jeremy Scahill for a discussion on the crazy apocalyptic present in which we find ourselves. They break down Trump’s attacks on the media, that insane speech he gave at the CIA, and the state of the Democratic Party. Naomi Klein sends in a dispatch from the Women’s March against the Trump-Pence administration about what’s at stake for people who are not men. Jeremy goes deep into the secretive world of Seymour Hersh’s kitchen and shoots the shit with the legendary, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist about why he calls Trump a “circuit breaker” for the two-party system. And we hear a spoken-word performance from hip-hop artist Immortal Technique.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu class=\"no-underline\">Subscribe to the Intercepted podcast on \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1195206601\">Apple Podcasts\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/Idegjjdk5aur4wgogpuuui5aldm\">Google Play\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/intercepted-with-jeremy-scahill\">Stitcher\u003c/a>, and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/podcasts/\">other platforms\u003c/a>.

Now, when Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and I started The Intercept, our idea was to bring an adversarial news organization that would bring accountability to very important institutions and people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama\u003c/strong>: We are closing the prison in Guantanamo. We are reforming military commissions and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists. We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions. And we’re narrowing our use of the state’s secret privilege.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And when we started The Intercept, Barack Obama was the president. This was a guy who ran a campaign to be the most transformative president in history, to have the most transparent administration in history. And when this Nobel Peace Prize winner started bombing countries, initiating new covert wars and overt wars, continuing some of Bush’s wars, we held him accountable. We were aggressive. We were nonpartisan and we were fiercely independent in our reporting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DT\u003c/strong>: Database is okay and watch list is okay and surveillance is okay. If you don’t mind, I wanna be, I wanna surveil. I want surveillance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Today we have a billionaire reality TV star who has pledged to operate the United States from a position of power where he believes in America-first policies. Donald Trump pledged to bring back torture. He pledged to fill Guantánamo back up again. Our mission at The Intercept has never been more urgent than it is right now. The reproductive rights of women, the liberty of muslims, the humanity of African-Americans who are facing down against paramilitarized police forces, and police brutality and police killings. All of this. All of these people, all of these communities, all of these issues, are in the crosshairs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Each week on the show we are going to break down the most urgent developments with the Trump administration. And we’re not just going to hold the Republicans, Trump, and the White House accountable, we’re also going to go after the Democrats. We’re going to go after media organizations and journalists who are not doing their jobs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music Interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: So to kick off our first show I’m joined by our editor-in-chief at The Intercept, Betsy Reed, and by my fellow Intercept co-founder, Glenn Greenwald, who is joining us from an undisclosed location in Rio.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, there is a tremendous amount to talk about even though Donald Trump’s administration is just days old. I want to start with you Betsy. What’s your take on this moment that we’re in right now, the events of the past week? There’s been a lot of attention paid to Trump’s relationship with the press. You had Sean Spicer and his attacks on the media and also his nonpress conference. It seems to be right now what a lot of media organizations are fixated on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Betsy Reed\u003c/strong>: Well I mean on one level I think it’s completely understandable that the media is freaking out because it really is truly shocking what happened in the White House briefing room and Sean Spicer what he said. Just the bald-faced lies. I think the media has a responsibility to call them out and correct them and confront them. There’s no question about that, but at the same time, it’s like I do worry we’re in this sort of cycle of self-obsession in the media. Like the whole news cycle is about the news. When in fact Trump, meanwhile, reinstated the global gag rule which is bringing us back to the Reagan era in terms of you know, blocking funds to any health organizations in other countries that provide abortion services. So I mean &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald\u003c/strong>: Did George Bush have that also? George W. Bush?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: Yes. Clinton had rescinded it after Reagan put it in place and then George W. put it back in and then Obama rescinded it. So I mean obviously it’s important for the media to call Trump out when he lies but at the same time we can’t like, lose sight of the very real sort of and rapid policy moves they’re making. Also what they’re doing across the board in terms of climate. Just completely, you know, dismantling all of Obama’s initiatives. It’s incredibly important. And it’s been great actually how that group of hackers has been going in to systematically retrieve and preserve the trove of climate data that could possible be eradicated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I also think it’s fascinating the way the whole debate at least on the official talk shows this past week was all about the kind of numbers debate. Where Trump was saying there was a million, million and a half people there. Spicer then comes in at his first official presence in front of the press, focuses the whole thing on the number of people who were at Trump’s inauguration, and how historic it was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But you know, I wanna back up a second regarding this media question. When it became clear that Trump was going to be the president, I started going back and reading some of the primary source material of officials of the National Socialist Party in Germany, of the Nazi party in Germany. Particularly the diaries of Joseph Goebbels who was Hitler’s minister of propaganda. And what’s interesting if you read Goebbels&#8217;s writings, they understood the power of the moving image at the time, what was becoming television and of radio. And they really were the first regime in the world to really master this emerging medium. And I think there’s a parallel to what we’re seeing with Trump and Twitter. Trump is basically sending this message everything is fake news that you don’t read on my Twitter feed. And at the same time you have this discussion — are they going to kick the U.S. press corps out of the White House, maybe move them to the old executive office building? What is the Trump’s relationship with the news media going to look like?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Steve Bannon, who ran Breitbart News is a very sophisticated so-called alt-right propagandist. At the same time though I’m not going to hold up Chuck Todd as some beacon of the free press, which he’s trying to make himself out to be. I mean these people were the most bankrupt, soulless, you know, un-independent journalists for so many years. Those journalists that would sit there, those media personalities that would sit there in the White House press room never asking real questions? I mean to me it’s kind of a double whammy. You’ve got terrible, almost worthless, sometimes corporate news organizations with a track record of knowing so little about so much. And then you have this authoritarian vibe that is being unleashed on the news media in this organization. Look at MSNBC. It’s basically — they’re re-litigating the Cold War. They’ll take any bit of unverified or unverifiable bullshit about the Russian hack and slap it up there as breaking news and never correct the record once it’s done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG\u003c/strong>: I mean, this is I think has been the problem for two months now or however long it’s been since the election. Which is everyone has reacted in a very kind of extreme way. Very impulsively, with a lot of emotion, which, as Betsy said earlier, is extremely understandable because there’s a lot of menacing things and seriously scary possibilities on the horizon. At the same time just reacting reflexively is not really a strategy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean whatever else you want to say about the Trump operation, they do have a consistent message. They do have a set of tactics that they use over and over. And so I think to effectively counter that, some thinking has to be done, some breathing, some cogency needs to emerge that I think has really been lacking among Democrats, among the media. Among just the entire political establishment that still has not found their footing in terms of how to respond.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I’m hoping that this protest, this march over the weekend, will be centering in that way because I think it was the first emboldening and empowering event. It made people feel like they weren’t lost, like they had a kind of voice. And I’m hoping there’s some structured, thoughtful way that these institutions that want to oppose Trump set out about to do it, rather than replicating his insanity and unhinged craziness. And turning everything into a circus, which I think only runs down to his benefit, as understandable as that reaction might be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: I agree with you. But I wonder if both of you are giving Trump too much credit. Do you really think they’re that competent. Is this all part of the plan?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG\u003c/strong>: I don’t think Trump is. I mean, If you listen to inaugural address that’s classic Steve Bannon, which was the message that they ultimately won on. The message that they won the Rust Belt on, which was: your jobs have been shipped overseas, the D.C. establishment only cares about billionaires, they’ve forgotten about you, you’re the forgotten people. And we’re going to respond and do things for you. We’re gonna save your jobs, we’re going to make you safe. We’re promising you things that you care about in your life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That may be a simplistic message, it may be a deceitful one, but it \u003cem>is\u003c/em> a message and it’s one they tap into consistently. I don’t think because Trump is some genius Machiavellian but I think there are people who are managing him who have an idea of what they’re doing. And if you want to beat that message there needs to be a counter-message beyond “oh my god, there are red spies under your bed and Putin is Trump’s boyfriend.” And I don’t think there has been that much of a message yet that has been cultivated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You see Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders sort of trying to urge Democrats to start to focus on one but I don’t think there has been one and I don’t think there’s been a media strategy either for how to deal with this new world beyond just screaming “you’re a liar, you’re a liar” back and forth, over and over, which I think most people are going to end up tuning out. And writing everything off and assuming nothing can be resolved, which I think the Trump White House wants most. Yes, of course Trump is an inept idiot, he’s a clown. He has some talent in entertainment. But no, he’s not some genius. But they do have, his circle has a set of messaging that has proven effective among a certain faction and I don’t think that should be ignored.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I will say first of all they won, and I think that &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: Not the popular vote.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: They won the election in the United States and they did what they needed to do to achieve their mission which was to take power in this country. I agree with you. I think Trump is a kind of devastating cocktail of incredible arrogance. A very acute sense of how many people in this country are filled with the kind of bigotry, ignorance and hate that makes his message resonate and also an authoritarian. By personality. Everything we’ve heard about this guy both publically and privately indicates that he is a fierce authoritarian. But at the same time who’s winning the battle in the court of public opinion? Trump or the news organizations? He’s forcing them to respond to his news agenda based on whatever the hell he tweets on any given day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He goes to the CIA with his own ready-made crowd to cheer although some CIA people there did cheer as well. Which you know, there’s a very serious dark part of what happened there at the CIA, which is I think there are elements of the CIA that view the kind of Phoenix Program return as a good thing, the assassination program in Vietnam. Like COINTELPRO, the FBI counterintelligence program that infiltrated dissident groups. But I don’t think we can underestimate Trump’s ability to understand the moment that he’s in in terms of pushing his own agenda forward. I do think it would be a mistake to simply write him off as the Cheeto-in-chief, or this buffoon that somehow &#8230; People did that with Bush too. Bush did eight years of pretty substantial damage when everyone thought that he was batting yarn in a backroom while Dick Cheney was running the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: It’s true but he’s only managed to fill a tiny sliver of the positions that he needs to. I mean he is bumbling along.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I don’t deny a basic level of incompetence. But let’s be clear, they’re outsourcing some of that to lobbyists now that are gonna fill … they’re outsourcing it. I wouldn’t be surprised if he got laborers from China to start filling some of the &#8230; No but Trump is also, because of Gen. Mike Flynn, his national security adviser, they’re going to shrink the size, intentionally of the National Security Council and they are going to be doing a gutting of the people that they consider not loyal enough within the national security apparatus. And I think that is causing a lot of concern in the intelligence community They’re going to go for the political purge.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: I think if anything is consistent it’s that Trump is highly retaliatory. Is that whenever he perceives he’s been attacked, he lashes back. And I think that’s going to define everything about the administration .\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And Glenn, Trump now is getting the the states out of the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, the TPP, which a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters were also against these so called free-trade global arrangements that the United States is in. NAFTA, GATT, now the TPP. What’s your read on this? Because I’ve seen a lot of Democrats now saying this is a win for China, it puts America last.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG\u003c/strong>: I think this presents this huge question that Betsy was referring to earlier, which is these issues — these trends — they’re not just American, they’re international. They’re really global. There was an article in the New York Times which was really quite good this weekend about the French elections and how the left is dead in France. It’s a competition between Marine Le Pen who’s the Trump candidate and a kind of more established right wing candidate. In the U.K. the left is dead. Corbyn is you know, 30 points behind Theresa May in all the polls, and throughout Europe you’re seeing working class voters who have traditionally supported the left because of unions and because of social programs abandoning them on social grounds but also economic grounds thinking their jobs have been sent overseas and they are the losers in globalization, returning to this nationalistic message.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And TPP is the perfect example of this which is just another horrible trade deal that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were behind. She said ultimately with the campaign that she would unravel it or at least fix it. But everyone knew she was actually for it. John McCain came out today saying Trump’s making a mistake and Trump’s out there saying “no more of these trade deals that are sending your jobs away.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Bernie Sanders is saying if we’re going to be Democrats, we have to side with the people who are worried about their economic future. And if Democrats instead take the other route, which is because Trump’s doing it we’re going to oppose it, we’re going to try and xenophobically worry about how this is strengthening China. Say that these trade deals are actually good when everyone knows they’re just good for Wall Street. I think it’s only going to worsen this trend. It’s going to make Democrats feel like they’re being clever because they’re attacking Trump from the nationalistic or militaristic and xenophobic right. But I think it’s just going to exacerbate this impression that the Democrats are this party that only cares about corporate American coastal elites. That has been the biggest problem this far and I don’t see Democrats doing much to confront that or examine that, or to figure out how to change that. And that’s what I say, I think Bernie Sanders is, Elizabeth Warren is but not much else.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: Yeah and I mean, if Democrats, if the mainstream of the Democratic Party takes that line and attacks him on TPP, unlike Bernie Sanders, it’s also going to drive a massive wedge into the progressive coalition that we just kind of saw come together in this incredibly moving way — the Women’s March. Some people sort of sniped about how it was just about women, but actually it was very inclusive, and broad based and brought in any number of constituencies and groups and races and everything and also it was very sort of grassroots in the whole spirit of it. But if you have, you know, this corporate Democratic elite, you know, attach itself to the pro-free-trade agenda, you’re just going to completely gut the potential, the populist, the real authentic populist potential of that movement we just saw.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And I was in the streets for both the day of the inauguration the protests there. And then also for the Women’s March. One thing that I found interesting — contrasting the vibe of that march on Saturday with the first anti-Trump demonstrations big ones, like in New York and elsewhere — there were a lot of people with the “I’m still with her” signs, the “not my president” [signs], focusing on the issue that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. You did see some of that in streets this weekend. But it was in the dramatic minority.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There were a lot of people that were there on women’s reproductive rights, on issues of climate change, racial justice issues, indigenous rights, huge contingent of indigenous women were there. Some of them tribal figures from the communities affected by the Dakota Access Pipeline. I think really the elites in the Democratic Party, it’s the weakest position they’ve been at in a very long time. One thing that I’ve noticed for instance, The Democratic Socialists for America, DSA, they really have stepped up their organizing. A lot of young people are mobilizing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: It’s true, I noticed them too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Bernie Sanders did the most substantial damage to the campaign to demonize the word socialism in generations, decades in this country. And so I think that people who are fed up with the established Democratic Party have their best shot in years to actually go to town, to actually mobilize and organize, and rather than it feeling like this dark ominous era is upon us. I came away from the events, Trump’s speech aside, of inauguration weekend in Washington, D.C., feeling like many people are fired up and it’s not about let’s get Hillary back into the race in four years, it was “what are we going to do right now?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: I think some of the most exciting movements right now are focused not on Washington but on sanctuary cities, where people can actually step up and protect the people who are going to be victimized most harshly by Trump’s policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG\u003c/strong>: Yeah, my last thought is, just to follow up on that and say I think this is the silver lining of the Trump debacle, the Trump disaster, which is that it does have the potential to recreate for the first time this kind of culture of protest and activism and empowerment which is really potent when it’s galvanized the right way and that has been missing certainly since 9/11, when you know Washington just gained all this power and the population kind of got cowed into this mix of patriotism and bullying and I think that this was this first step. That although for me wasn’t perfect, the fact that it was organic and just very spontaneous and people driven. I think it’s actually one of the first positive, inspiring things that has happened in many months in U.S. politics, certainly since the election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: I obviously agree and it was impossible not to be moved when you’re a part of those crowds. But I do think the main purpose of those marches was sort of solidarity building and you know, just trying to restore our unbelievably depressed morale at this moment. And I think it really served it’s purpose well there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I don’t think that the marches were particularly successful in kind of convincing anyone else who doesn’t already agree with everybody who’s in the street, that like there’s something wrong with Trump. And in fact you saw, all over the media, the social media networks, a lot of Trump supporters were kind of complaining: “What are they doing? What are these women complaining about?” The fact that there wasn’t a clear set of demands and clear message actually made it look to those people who were looking at it from the outside like it was really just about being upset that we didn’t get our way and stamping our feet that we didn’t get our way in the election. That’s how it’s perceived. I’m not saying that’s legitimate, but you know, I do think we have to think going forward in a broader strategic way about how we can kind of build something that will grow the ranks of this movement rather than just kind of making ourselves feel better. Which is important, I don’t mean to diminish the importance of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And I think there’s a clear contrast, and some of this is generational, and some of it is racial and some of it is class. But there’s a huge divide between the ever-aging leadership of the Democratic Party on Capitol Hill and people that are at the forefront of mobilizing in new ways. Whether it’s young black activists or it’s indigenous activists. And I do think there was education happening in the streets. Because I think the diversity that was present there did internal education for a lot of people about the issues of what others and what they find important.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I would say contrast that kind of vibe with stale gray Washington and look at who votes to confirm all these horrid people that Trump has put up in his cabinet. Those people should be held accountable for voting for pro torture Mike Pompeo, pro-privatization of schools Betsy DeVos, and the list goes on and on and on from there, climate change deniers, etc. Politicians who play the game of this is just how politics work and we have to give him a chance, they’re not actually part of resisting much of anything, any more than somebody on MSNBC is part of the resistance because they put forward this “Russia is hiding behind every corner in our society.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well I want to thank my colleagues Betsy Reed and Glenn Greenwald for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: Thank you Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Protesters\u003c/strong>: We won’t go away. Welcome to your first day. We won’t go away. Welcome to your first day. We won’t go away. Welcome to your first day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The weekend of the inauguration I was on the streets both on the day of the inauguration as well as on Saturday during the massive Women’s March. And I was joined by my friend Naomi Klein, who is a writer, an author, and a journalist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Naomi Klein\u003c/strong>: I think it’s wonderful that the first mass action is a women’s march and you have all these sort of ridiculous debates of “Why isn’t it an everyone march?” And it’s like, I think it’s great this debate is being aired because we have to understand that yes they’re coming for everyone and everyone’s going to impacted, but not everyone’s going to be impacted in the same way. There are specificities here. There are people who are way more vulnerable. And we can’t have the attitude that we’re only going to focus on our issue. Because that would be way too weak, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Protesters\u003c/strong>: We are the popular vote. We are the popular vote.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK\u003c/strong>: I’ve been hearing sort of a worrying message of like it’s so outrageous. The hypocrisies are so intense that obviously people are going to see this. That Trump ran as champion of the working man, and he’s going to stand up to the corruption and billionaires in Washington. And then just fills his administration with them. There’s &#8230; some people seem to be expecting that there’s going to a spontaneous revolt of Trump’s space. And, you know, what scares me is that as the economic facade falls away, the racism, the weaponizing of race, and the weaponizing of gender becomes all the more important because that’s all they have to offer. The economic stuff was obviously a sham. But they’re going to feed that to their base to make sure they don’t lose them. What we need to understand is how misogyny and racism are used to advance this agenda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Protesters\u003c/strong>: This is what a feminist looks like. Tell me what a feminist looks like. This is what a feminist looks like.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK\u003c/strong>: Hatred of women is a bright thread running through this administration. It’s not incidental, you know. There are key figures surrounding Trump, and Trump himself, who have been accused of sexual assault, abuse of their partners. It’s an epidemic, right? When you think about the people who are, we forget about, there in the background, like Roger Ailes there in the background, turned his whole workplace into &#8230; This is like the White House as frat house. I mean it is so disgusting. That’s a good reason to march.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Protesters\u003c/strong>: Donald Trump has got to go.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: That was Naomi Klein, journalist, author, activist at the Women’s March on Washington. In a minute I’m going to be chatting with the legendary journalist Sy Hersh. And what he has to say about Trump may surprise you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: In trying to dissect what’s happening in the world of Donald Trump’s relation to the CIA, I thought it would be really fascinating to sit down with the legendary investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, who is of course a Pulitzer Prize winner. He broke the story of the My Lai Massacre during the war in Vietnam, he broke the Abu Ghraib torture story. He did several hard hitting investigative pieces when the Bush administration came into power about the way that they were expanding assassination operations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And for those of you who are not entirely familiar with Sy Hersh’s career, in the 1970s, when Gerald Ford was president, after the impeachment and resignation of Richard Nixon, Sy Hersh, who at the time was a reporter for The New York Times, had revealed the fact that the CIA was operating domestically. and was engaged in illegal spying. And Dick Cheney while he was in the Ford administration in 1970s, tried to get the FBI to go after Sy Hersh. In fact he wanted Sy Hersh to be indicted for espionage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sound familiar?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We are now in a situation where we just had a Democratic president who presided over a war against whistleblowers, which is in many ways is a war against a free press, where a charge of espionage was used to go after people who were whistleblowers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well this week, I went over to Sy’s house and we sat down at his kitchen and it wasn’t so much an interview. It was more that I wanted to shoot the shit with this incredible reporter who has faced down with authoritarian administrations before, in what is really a conversation between two journalists. I began by asking Sy to give me his assessment of what Trump’s election and his emerging administration, what we should make of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Seymour Hersh\u003c/strong>: I can, I can play high-end or low-end. Let me give you the, the high-end. He’s a circuit breaker. You know? Here we are, we’ve got, we’ve had I think you can say for the past three or four decades, the oligarchs have been running everything and these guys are simply cutting out the middlemen. Those little greedy congressmen and senators who want their hands out. So they’re just cutting out the middlemen and he’s naming people to the cabinet jobs that have one thing, they’re all very very rich. They’re all multi-millionaires. Their career is over, they’re not using, they’re not gonna use the, the cabinet job they have to run for president for, or run for anything for, so this in a way, there’s no reason for them to disagree with the boss. I mean not to disagree with the boss. They have nothing to lose. You could argue that. And that he might have a new relationship with Putin and that’s the high-end.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think increasingly as you look at it, I mean that’s not going to be the reality. But the idea of somebody you know, breaking things away, you know, and raising grave doubts about the viability of the party system, particularly the Democratic Party, are not a bad idea. That’s something, we could build on that in the future. But we have to figure out what to do in the next few years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So there’s a high-end thing where you can say he’s such an outlier, that who knows what’s going to happen? Um, but you know, and then you could do the other side, you know. I don’t tell you what history. You have to go back into the ’30s, the first thing you do is destroy the media, which he can do, he’s going to intimidate ‘em. And then once you do the media and there’s gonna be, I can tell you my friends on the inside have already told me there’s going to be a major increase in surveillance. If you don’t have Signal, you better get Signal. If you don’t have one of those devices that makes it very difficult for people to track you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: You’re talking about the end-to-end encrypted apps, like Signal and &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Yeah, well Signal’s one of the better ones that they really can’t do much with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Yeah, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: I mean it’s Snowden’s means of communication. And so there’s also, also devices you can get that prevent you from being tracked. There’s also devices that can detect malware. So all that’s &#8230; There’s a downside to it. I understand that they’re going to be doing some purging. People on the inside who are suspect. And on more than just suspect left, suspect as being Islamist. I mean, really far out stuff. Really, stuff like that going on. I don’t think the notion of democracy is ever going to be as tested as it’s going to be now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, I mean, and Trump, the day after his inauguration goes to the CIA and gives that speech in front of the wall of the stars of the fallen agents. What did you make of it? And he, and he was mostly obsessed with the size of his crowd but what did you make of that first meeting, official meeting of the CIA?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Ha. I can’t begin to tell you. Well he’s obviously going to remake the CIA. And he’s got some basis for thinking that there was, you know, the case. I don’t want to get too much into what I’m reporting but I can tell you the case about Russia. There’s a much simpler explanation for what happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The real thing that I wanted to ask about here is: does Trump have a point when he says that these were leaks intended to undermine his credibility and damage him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: That came from the CIA or other parts of the intelligence?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Of course. There’s no question. I mean you see Brennan is speaking out, even now that he’s out of office, still speaking out. And that’s sort of, we haven’t seen that before.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well Brennan’s primary, you know primary thing that he claims he’s speaking out about is Trump’s use of the words nazis to describe people in the intelligence community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: But before that he was speaking out. But look, the road is open for alternative journalism in a way that it hasn’t been in a long time. Because I don’t — I don’t think —mMy view of the way major media treated the thing with the Russian thing and the Putin wire tag, the hacking, is they were hectoring. They were just using it to hector. They didn’t do reporting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the real story was the extent to which the White House was going and permitting this kind of stuff to go, and permitting the agency to go public with assessments. What does an assessment mean? It’s not a national intelligence estimate. If you had a real estimate you would have five or six dissents, people saying, ‘cause I can tell you right now. One time they said 17 agencies all agreed. Oh really? The Coast Guard and the Air Force, they all agreed on it? And it was outrageous and nobody did that story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Even in their own summary that they released, the NSA’s level of confidence, as reported in that was a full degree lower than that of Clapper and his crowd. And on what issue?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: An assessment is simply an opinion. It’s not — if they had a fact, they’d give you. An assessment is just that. It’s a belief.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I mean what, how, how do you think journalists should be operating right now, given the fact that the first White House press briefing by Sean Spicer — no questions allowed — leaves the room, and the fact that they’re talking about ejecting them from the, from the White House, sticking them in the old executive building. But also just the open “fuck you” to the press that we hear every single day?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: You know it’s interesting because the press is an easy target. We always are. Everyone wants to hate us like lawyers you know. All the lawyer jokes. But the truth is, and this is the campaign theme he had about the press and there was a significant percentage of people don’t want to believe the press. But the truth is the First Amendment is an amazing thing and if you start trampling the way they, I hope they don’t do it that way, it would be really counter productive. Um, he’ll be in trouble.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: What do you make of what we know about the emerging relationship between Trump and the CIA? Based on who he has around him, the kinds of policies that they’ve advocated and the personality we see, you know, Trump embody. What is Trump’s CIA going to look like?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Oh of course, who knows? The real answer is you know, how the hell do I know? But you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But let’s remember too, Trump said I want, I love waterboarding, he wants to stuff Guantánamo back up again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: You know, is that just a reality TV showman saying these things?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: I don’t know. He also said he was going to do this, this, this. And his first day in office he didn’t do it. I don’t know. Look, we had a Democratic president for eight years that couldn’t &#8230; Every day, he did what? He escalated in Afghanistan? You know, again you say how are we doing there? How’s it going? How’s the war on terror going now? Since we started. How’s it been going for 16 years. Are there fewer opposition guys. How’s it going? He may surprise us and look at it and say woah, but I don’t think so. But I’m willing to look at it. Because as I said, circuit breaker’s the word. We’ve never had anything like this before. But I wish he was a little different.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I always thought there’d come a point where Trump will decide, I’m gonna hand the running of the White House over to my sons, and I’m gonna go to back to doing … I’m not sure the guy understands anything about the constitution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Ha.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But I do think, the combination of Pence’s record and Trump, what we see as Trump’s nature, I do think, I think you’re right to say we don’t know what the fuck’s going to happen. But we’ve seen some pretty bad indicators from the telegraph in here that they, you know, Trump does seem to want to bring back some of the worst components of the Bush-Cheney apparatus, combined with the fact that Mr. Transformative Nobel Peace Prize-winning-constitutional-law-scholar-Obama, basically sold liberals on the idea that we can whack people around the world, that drones are good, that we can engage in all of these little twilight wars, covert operations. Obama cleaned up a lot of the Cheney doctrine for his own people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: How dare you attack him? How dare you? You’re right about him. Before, he did not change the basic structure. I think two days in office, his first executive action was to say I’m gonna shut down Guantánamo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But I do think that it’s possible Trump will try to transfer some of the people that Obama had prosecuted through the civil court system in this country on terrorism charges down to Gitmo. And I’m hearing that concern from the lawyers that represent prisoners at Gitmo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: What are we doing in this country? What the hell, where are we going? I don’t know. I mean it’s — look it’s good for you. You’re, you’re intensely involved in a news service that’s going to get much more attention now. I’m watching it more and more and more and more and I’m not alone. It’s good for you guys, don’t knock it. A little adversity, a little end of democracy, you know. Just communicate with Signal, that’s all.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I mean, I know what you’re saying but I also. I am really concerned about the surveillance stuff, I’m concerned that there’s a &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: That’s the word. That’s the word. That’s the word I was hoping you would bring up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Surveillance?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Yes, that’s going to be the real issue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Oh I mean&#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: I mean don’t go over the top. It doesn’t mean you don’t do what you do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: No, no, no. What I’m saying though, just to give you an example and I’d like to hear your thoughts on this: We focus a lot on the NSA and the NSA’s collection abilities, the ability to get into people’s data, their phones, their computers, etc. Even now our smart appliances, your refrigerator, what have you. The DEA for instance, Drug Enforcement Agency, is one of the most pathological violators of privacy and flagrant violation of the law and Constitution. These guys don’t care about warrants, etc. They’ll use stuff that’s supposed to be all close-held, no access for use in domestic operations. DEA forever has been tapping into systems that are meant for foreign espionage stuff, have nothing to do with what they’re doing inside the U.S. or even outside of the U.S. in some cases. With someone like Trump though at the helm &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean Obama allowed so much of this stuff to go on, maybe permitted or authorized some of it, maybe just looked the other way. But with Trump and some of the people that he has, and his really thin-skinned ability to respond to criticism, or to take criticism, I’m concerned that they’re going to use this stuff as a domestic weapon — the surveillance stuff as a domestic weapon. I mean I know, I mentioned it in the book “Blackwater” about what the FBI and the CIA wanted to do to you. Breaking, going after you, fabricating stuff, breaking in. Our phones, our computers are the digital equivalent of breaking into your files now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: I’ll &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Except not all of your medical records and everything else are on that. And your texts with your girlfriend or whoever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Well to that I normally would say boohoo, okay. That’s the price of life. Hold on a second. I’ll match you though. I‘ll match you one, I’ll tell you one. I have reason to believe that when Gonzales was Attorney General.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Alberto Gonzales.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Yes. In 2005 maybe for a year or two. There were cases in which there was tough cases of people we didn’t like, people we thought could maybe be having some connection to a money ring, you know, theoretically drugs or terrorism. And they didn’t have the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so NSA has everything. And so there were cases where they went hunting. They got the NSA to pull up some months worth of gmails or phone conversations of a guy that they’re trying to indict. And they found a conversation, they went to the person that had the conversation, pretended they had a confidential informant. This is what the DEA does all the time. They had a confidential informant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: They call it parallel construction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: And turn a witness that they didn’t have until they went to look at it. Now there you’re really talking. Now we can have the Fourth Amendment violation, now we’re talking about the Fifth Amendment — the right of self defense. Zowee! Zowee! So anything’s possible. Anything’s possible. So we’re in a new world. And it’s a new paradigm I guess you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well they use it like a time—what you’re saying, this is something that we’ve seen worn out, not just in the Snowden docs but also from people who’ve worked on these programs. The passive collection of all this data. You know, the vast majority of people, no one’s ever going to look at that. No one’s going to care what phone call you had or email you had when you show up on the radar of the right person or wrong person depending on how you look at it. They can go back and it’s like a time machine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Well, we know that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Right, so with Obama we saw how that was used globally. Within the United States, the combination of that platform with what we see of Trump’s personality? I’m just saying I’m concerned that we’re gonna see a sort of modern version of you know, the enemies list that Nixon had running and Hoover type shit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: But maybe it’s, you know, I’m not Little Mary Sunshine — this is not a Little Mary Sunshine conversation — but Trump also feels victimized by leaks and secondhand stuff in the hotels and you know that stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The golden shower stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Whatever, that stuff. He must feel very victimized by that side of security. And you know there’s nothing like somebody who’s been victimized, maybe there’s a chance he won’t want it. Why not?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Him personally, Sy? Okay, maybe. Look, he’s got some gangsters that are going to become very prominent in the corridors of some of these intelligence agencies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Was anybody more of a gangster than some of the leading people who’ve conducted the wars we’ve had? We’ve had gangsters all of our life in our society. And they, some of them were senators and some of them were, you know, secretaries of defense, were some murderous murderous people. I’m not, I’m not making a case &#8230; I hear what you’re saying. I’m just saying I’m worried. I have to be really worried. I was joking. You know i was joking saying that all the marches in the world aren’t going to move him out of office. But let’s just see.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Boredom might though.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Let’s just see. Let’s just see. You never know. You never know about things, and there’s some things &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I would love to be wrong about all of this stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: You don’t have to be wrong, just be wrong about a few things that you know, just be wrong that he may see the world in a business sense. And look, God, I was appalled by the appointments in the cabinet. Just appalled. I mean what? What? But you don’t know. You don’t know. There’s not much I don’t think.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But what’s your advice to journalists? What should journalists be doing during this time? I don’t mean me, I just mean in general. What do you think news organizations, you said before, get up and fuck it, leave the room. How should journalists cover this administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: They’re not going to do that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I know they won’t but how do you think journalists should cover this administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: They should not let them bully them. They should not be bullied by a press secretary who behaves so egregiously in a way that’s so contentious as he did. They should not accept it. They should make it plain. And if he wants to send them off to the executive office building or to the State Department or on the street. Just go. And minimize the reporting except be there to nail everything he does that doesn’t live up to his own words. You still have the press. He’s not going to take the press away from you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well he just goes on Twitter and says it’s all lies. And you, I mean he could be sitting in the room with us and say we’re actually sitting on a spaceship on Mars right now. And you and I say, “No, we’re sitting in Sy Hersh’s house.” And he would say, “No, you’re not.” And we say “Well we’re videotaping this, everyone’s going to see it.” And he’d say, “Well that’s fake news.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: You know, but they do enough about it — the press. The trouble is you know we’ve got a different press these days. And it’s changed so much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But don’t you think that we’ve crossed some sort of a … we have crossed some sort of, into some different dimension now with the sort of post-truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Yeah. And so I think that we might see better reporting. As I said, it’s gonna be good for opposition. Most people I think there’s gonna be more political activism. I think the Democratic Party, I just hope it doesn’t blow up and, you know, if they stick to the old way, they’re gonna blow it up and then you’re gonna make it easier for Republicans. You don’t want a split right now. Isn’t that terrible?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: You don’t smell a whiff of fascism right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: What do you mean whiff? When you attack the press the way they’re attacking. I just don’t know if there’s the &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Sorry I’m trying to reconcile, you saying I don’t know it may not be that bad. I mean I get it, it’s responsible to say you don’t know what’s going to happen yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: But I’m saying also this &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: He overtly has a pretty authoritarian fascist aura.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: But no. The attack on the press is straight out, it’s national socialism. But do I think he knows that? Do I think he knows the history? No, I don’t think so. I don’t think he knows, you know, he’s not dumb. He’s not a dumb man. But I don’t think he’s at all interested in learning anything. It’s not clear he’s learned anything since he’s even been … I mean, the speech he gave at the inauguration was bereft of any sign of — it was lame. It was not … and the words, we’re talking about a seventh, eighth grade level here. I mean, plain words. That’s okay. Lincoln used plain words. Lincoln was very … you didn’t get him into a sophisticated &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But this business of immediately we take off the women’s page, the LGBTQ page, the climate page, we shut down the Interior Department, shut down these Twitter accounts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: You know, Jeremy, let’s let it happen, that’s all I can say.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I’m trying to not let it happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: But no, but you can’t stop it. Let’s just see, that’s what I’m saying. Let’s just see.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But whose, who do you think has his ear? Steve Bannon, uh, Flynn, Mattis. I mean who?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Well I’ll tell you one person who doesn’t is the chief of staff. I mean he’s not going to know what’s going on. But that’s probably not so unusual. Look, I’m just not ready to say, I’m not ready to say the roof is, you know I’m not crying yet, I do know the big worry would be surveillance for me. Not personally because you know I do what I do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Surveillance of who?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Surveillance of, general increase, dramatic increase, in domestic surveillance. Dramatic increase and continuing to single out Muslims which is crazy and continuing to talk about a war. I just, I just want to see what happens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Don’t start letting your worry about tomorrow affect what you write today. That’s all. You know, there’s a lot out there. So I think the alternative medias are gonna have a little bit of a wave and be more important in the next three, four years. ‘Cause I just don’t think the major papers are up to it. I just don’t, I didn’t see it. I didn’t see what they did. The way they behaved on the Russia stuff was outrageous. They all just ran for briefings and they, I’m talking about in the news pages. And Trump absolutely, I’m sorry to tell you, he has a case. They were just so willing to believe stuff. And when the heads of intelligence give them that two-page summary of the stuff that the allegations, instead of attacking the CIA for doing that, which is what I would have done, my story is: are you kidding me? They’re taking it to a guy who’s going to be president in a couple of days, they’re giving him this kind of stuff and they think this is somehow going to make the world better? It’s going to make him go nuts — would make me go nuts. So I look at it that way you know. Maybe it isn’t that hard to make him go nuts. That’s &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But that’s what I was talking about earlier. There’s this, there was this incredible &#8230; It’s almost like sea monkeys. You know those things, you put them in this powder and then they turn into these little things. It’s like all of a sudden, CIA it the greatest thing in the world and how dare you question the pronouncements of the &#8230; This is coming from the Democrats, from MSNBC. It’s like you know all of a sudden, there was no Iraq War, there’s not lying, there’s no history of the CIA. It’s just these are our brave spies that are keeping us safe from Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: And I would have made, me, I would have made Brennan into a buffoon. A yapping buffoon in the last few days. Instead, they … everything is reported seriously. So there’s a lot of you know, it’s not so easy you know. You got a hothead as president who doesn’t think through and so let’s just see.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I agree with you. I’m not disagreeing with you about the need. I just think from your point of view, and I know this is what we’re talking about, this is all manna. It just means you guys have to do more of it and more people will pay attention to you and more people will take it seriously.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alright listen we’ve been doing this for three days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Alright, well you know, have fun moving back to Russia. Thanks, Sy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH\u003c/strong>: Goodbye.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: That was the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sy Hersh.

This week on Intercepted we talk to former senior FBI agent Ali Soufan about the commander in chief’s radical edicts, the “Muslim ban,” and Trump&#8217;s campaign to make torture great again. Constitutional rights lawyers Faiza Patel and Vince Warren dissect the (il)legality of Trump’s immigration ban and Rep. Barbara Lee breaks down Trump’s terrifying approach to government. Former covert agent Mike German and Intercept Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed explain what secret FBI documents published this week by The Intercept tell us about how Trump could resurrect J. Edgar Hoover’s legacy. Hip-hop artist Brother Ali performs. Plus, Peter Sarsgaard stars in the bizarre true story of an NSA operative with exciting vacation tips for fellow operatives on their way to interrogate prisoners at Guantánamo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu class=\"no-underline\">Subscribe to the Intercepted podcast on \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1195206601\">Apple Podcasts\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/Idegjjdk5aur4wgogpuuui5aldm\">Google Play\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/intercepted-with-jeremy-scahill\">Stitcher\u003c/a>, and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/podcasts/\">other platforms\u003c/a>.

Well, Donald Trump has been in power less than two weeks, and he has already managed to do incredible damage. He is signing executive orders like they are autographed pictures.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But this isn’t a reality show. This is our world. This is our country. And these executive orders, particularly the one that many people, I think, are rightly calling a Muslim ban, it’s already separating Muslims. It is targeting Muslims, it’s targeting Arabs, it is targeting Africans. It at times has been targeting legal permanent residents, people with green cards. And it’s also being celebrated by not only neo-Nazi groups, but by ISIS. These orders are not gonna make us safer. They are going to increase hostility against the United States, and they are going to empower violent radicals abroad and also within the United States. This is going to get people killed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I checked in this week with Barbara Lee. She is a Democratic congressperson from California. She is the only member of Congress who, right after 9/11, voted against the Authorization for the Use of Military Force, the blank check that the Democrats and the Republicans gave to Bush and Cheney to declare the world a battlefield and wage these endless wars. I asked her for her take on this moment that we’re in right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Barbara Lee\u003c/strong>: I’m very terrified with regard to what we see taking place. And the signs are there. When you talk about shutting down the media, putting out their alternative facts, banning dissent and opposition, criticizing people who are exercising their First Amendment rights; trying to get people to believe, really, the distortions that they’re putting out there. That, to me, is very scary. It’s very dangerous. And you see also the corporate and military consolidation of the public sector. You see efforts to privatize schools. When you just look at the nominees, you see very few people with experience in the public sector. And so when you have the corporate sector merging with the military sectors, and when you have Cabinet officials who have historically said they want to dismantle the Cabinets and the agencies that they’re running, that I’m very terrified that we are beginning to see an erosion of our democratic values and an erosion of the public sector.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Now, there’s been a lot of attention paid to this extraordinary move that Donald Trump took on Monday night, when he fired the acting Attorney General Sally Yates. And he fired her in direct retaliation for her standing up and saying, “I’m not convinced that this executive order is lawful.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff Sessions\u003c/strong>: But if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sally Yates\u003c/strong>: Senator, I believe that the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law in the Constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: This is the beginning of what are going to be a series of Nixon-esque moves by this Trump White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Nixon\u003c/strong>: Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Meanwhile, Trump’s Cabinet appointees continue to get confirmed. The Democrats are putting up some resistance. They’ve boycotted some aspects of it. But most of these people, if not all of them — they’re going to end up in these positions. We are going to end up with the Cabinet of billionaires, bigots, Islamophobes, racists, and very dangerous people to be in charge of a country with nuclear weapons, massive surveillance powers, special operations forces around the globe. Who is the person running the show right now? Steve Bannon.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Steve Bannon\u003c/strong>: What we need to do is bitch slap the Republican Party and get those guys, you know, heaving to. And if we have to, we’ll take it over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, a white nationalist — some would say a white supremacist. Steve Bannon is now going to be on the Principals Committee of the National Security Council. The Democratic Party is not where the resistance is right now. The resistance is in the streets. And you know what? It’s a lot of ordinary people who have seen what these executive orders have already done, and they’ve responded spontaneously.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Crowd\u003c/strong>: Refugees are welcome here! No hate, no fear! Refugees are welcome here! No hate, no fear!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male speaker\u003c/strong>: Show me what America looks like!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Crowd\u003c/strong>: This is what America looks like!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lee Gelernt\u003c/strong>: The courts work the way they’re supposed to work in our country. The president could not override the courts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Crowd\u003c/strong>: No hate, no fear! Refugees are welcome here! No hate!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And it’s coming from the American Civil Liberties Union, from the Center for Constitutional Rights, from immigrant rights activists and advocates. But this is the beginning of a very long battle in the streets and legally. I’m joined by two people. Faiza Patel is the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice and Vince Warren is the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. That is the organization that they were the first lawyers to defend prisoners taken to Guantánamo in the aftermath of 9/11. I want to welcome both of you to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Faiza Patel\u003c/strong>: Great to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Vince Warren\u003c/strong>: Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The first thing I wanted to ask both of you about is just your assessment of that first week of Trump’s administration and this avalanche of executive actions, executive orders. Obviously, the executive order barring people from seven countries from coming into the United States, and also, at least for a time, really targeting people who also had green cards, what’s your assessment from a legal perspective of where this fits into U.S. history on immigration policy, and what are the sort of stakes right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FP\u003c/strong>:  I think the stakes are super high, but I think it’s important to distinguish between the different executive directives that have come out of the White House. So some of them have immediate effect, such as the ban that went into place on Friday, which disrupted so many lives over the weekend. But many of them are actually just telling Congress or telling the agencies and signaling what it is that he wants to do. At the same time, I mean, there’s obviously this intent to have this avalanche of executive orders to make it look like, wow, he’s definitely doing something, you know? He’s a man of action. But the question is really whether action without thought and without a real understanding of the consequences is necessarily a good thing. And I think that’s really lost in the conversation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Vince, what about the — there are critics and there are people within Trump’s circle that are saying, look, Obama did this. He did this in 2011. He did a sweeping set of restrictions on people coming out of Iraq. This is born of some of Obama’s own watchlisting policies, and it’s perfectly legal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VW\u003c/strong>: People are very excited now on the right to talk about, well, Obama did this first, so it’s perfectly fine for Donald Trump to do it. But the first answer to that is, President Obama did a range of things that were ill-advised, and I think were problematic. But I think, more importantly, that we have to separate presidential authority to make these types of pronouncements from the wisdom and judgment by which they do it. And I think one of the really key differences between prior administrations and this one is that not only is the power that Donald Trump invoking sweeping, but also, his analysis is very ill-defined and also sweeping, so that it creates the effect of actually having a Muslim ban.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we can have discussions about whether it is a Muslim ban or it is not.  But when you’re looking at seven majority Muslim countries that you’re doing a total ban on people coming in for a variety of reasons for a particular time, and you are signaling that you’re gonna preference religious minorities in majority Muslim countries, particularly Christians, that speaks pretty broadly about a Muslim ban. And that’s something that President Obama hasn’t done before. And I think, frankly, when we look back on this time 20 years from now, it’s gonna be one of the darkest moments in presidential history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, and of course, almost immediately once the order was signed, and then you had people being denied entry into the United States, including green card holders, this emergency legal action was taken. A federal judge stayed portions of Trump’s executive order. And in fact, Customs and Border Protection agents were ordered to comply with this federal judge’s ruling, but they didn’t do that in some cases. And we’re hearing many tales of CBP basically defying a federal judge’s order, Faiza. So what’s your assessment of what happened there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FP\u003c/strong>: So we’ve actually had five different federal judges order halts to different portions of the program. And I think the bit that you’re referencing is the order that came out of the district court in Virginia, which applies to Dulles Airport. We were hearing that the Customs and Border authorities were not giving access to attorneys to their clients. Now obviously, if CBP is ignoring a court order, that’s a really big problem. And I guess the next question then becomes, why is CBP ignoring that order? Is it doing so on its own authority, or is it doing so because it’s been directed by somebody higher up not to follow through on that order? So I think those are some very important questions that we don’t have the answers to yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, and Homeland Security Secretary Gen. John Kelly did issue a statement basically saying, we’re backing off this business of targeting green card holders. But they did still say that green card holders now have to go through an additional vetting process, even though they’ve been through — they’ve had their entire lives put into a proctological exam just to get the green card, Vince.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VW\u003c/strong>: Absolutely. This is, you know — it’s better to think about this as essentially a constitutional crisis that has been instigated by the president. So, we have a scenario where there are executive orders that say one thing. The head of various administrations are saying another thing. Those are not getting passed down to the rank and file, though, the people who are responsible for enforcing. They’re not sure what to enforce and what not to. The federal judge says, “Don’t enforce anything.” Some of the agencies are still enforcing it, even though their leaders say that we shouldn’t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is the danger of leading by executive order because it’s created so much chaos that civil society, the civil and human rights groups, like the ACLU, the Brennan Center, Center for Constitutional Rights, have had to respond in very, very tactical ways. But the response has been as varied as the measure of chaos that’s been put out there. So, everybody is very confused. And the people that are suffering are the poor people that are coming back to visit their relatives, that are trying to leave the country and don’t know if they’ll ever get back. And they’re put into handcuffs during these types of interrogations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And so, the next part of this — and I really think almost no one in this country understands that the courts have upheld the assertion from the executive that people basically don’t have Fourth Amendment rights in airport interrogation. What do I mean by that? Now, you’re lawyers. You may take issue with some of what I’m saying. But they have a right to search all of your belongings. They’ve asserted the right to read any emails that they can access on your computer, to read your text messages, to download the contacts on your phone. When we obtained, at The Intercept, in 2014, the government’s 166-page rulebook for watchlisting guidance — I just want to read you part of this because I don’t think people understand, this is even before Trump and executive orders. This was under President Obama. And this is when they encounter you at a border.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“In addition to data like fingerprints, travel itineraries, identification documents, and gun licenses, the rules encourage screeners,” meaning the people who are interacting with people crossing our borders or coming into our airports, “to acquire health insurance information, drug prescriptions, any cards with an electronic strip on it, hotel cards, grocery cards, gift cards, frequent flyer cards, cell phones, email addresses, binoculars, peroxide, bank account numbers, pay stubs, academic transcripts, parking and speeding tickets,” and on and on and on. All of this stuff — and this is directly quoting from the government’s watchlisting guidance — existed under Obama. And the courts have actually said, when this has been challenged, no, actually, they do have a right to do all of that. And they can hold you for an undetermined amount of time. It just says “a reasonable amount of time.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, if that was the standard that already was on the books, and now we have these executive orders combined with open, overt Islamophobic, bigoted rhetoric, where does that put us? Because no one seemed to be up in arms about this except a handful of civil liberties organizations, some journalists, and lawyers trying to fight this. And it’s great that the ACLU’s getting 19 million dollars in donations right now, but where were people when this stuff was going on since 9/11?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FP\u003c/strong>: So, I think people were very much there, and I think there are two things to recognize, right? One is that generally, in immigration law and at the border, the executive branch, the president, DHS, Customs and Border Patrol, do have a fair amount of discretion. And that has historically been the case. That doesn’t mean that their discretion is unlimited, but you do give them some flexibility because you’re trying to keep the nation’s borders secure. At the same time —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: You don’t get a lawyer there, though.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FP\u003c/strong>: No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FP\u003c/strong>: You don’t get the lawyer there. But let me finish, because I think it’s important to keep in mind that discretion can be abused or it can be used in ways that are useful, are reasonable, right? And so, when you have policies that come into it which do harm some people — and they definitely went overboard in some instances. There’s no question about that. But if, in fact, Customs and Border Patrol actually asked every traveler coming into the United States for all of that information, you would not have international travel coming in through our airports. So there has to be some understanding of when these kinds of information is requested, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, you’re right. Most of the time, information was requested from people traveling from Muslim countries, and was requested from people traveling from other third world countries. But there was always some kind of cap on that. Now, you’re in a situation where you have an administration that has an overtly hostile attitude towards a particular faith and towards particular countries. So that’s got to filter down to CPB and make what was already a pretty tough policy even worse for people coming into the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VW\u003c/strong>: My assessment is, Center for Constitutional Rights has been around for 50 years, and for the last 15, we’ve been very deeply in the post-9/11 scenario. And we have been saying for a very long time under George Bush, under Barack Obama, and it’s the same thing under Donald Trump, is that it’s not just the person who is the president that is the ultimate problem, although we have a particularly problematic one these days. It’s the power of the presidency and the power of the executive branch that is the problem. And so, it was a much easier sell to get people to care under George Bush. It was virtually impossible to get people to focus on these issues under President Obama. And had we had more support for those issues, we might have been able to push back to limit some of these powers so that a crazy man like Donald Trump doesn’t come in and deploy them, and then have a range of folks who are very reasonable and rational say, “But, you know, this is the power of the presidency.” That’s the ultimate problem that we have here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FP\u003c/strong>: I couldn’t agree more with that statement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And look. I mean, I am so heartened to see the diversity and the numbers of people pouring into the streets, going on their own volition to airports to both confront this injustice, but also to be there to welcome people when they come and say, “This policy doesn’t speak for all of us.” I mean, it’s an incredible moment that we’re in. But I also think it’s a teachable moment that when we snooze or sleep during periods when someone like Obama is in power, who so many people identify with, they like him, they believe in him. For a lot of people, the conscience is sort of checked at the door when the Democrats are in power. Of course, not for you guys, but that is a lot of what we’re hearing now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Obama picked up from where Bush and Cheney left off, not — I don’t think he took things in the insane direction they would have if they had eight more years in power. But he did a lot of disturbing things with executive authority. And Trump is a product of that whole system.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VW\u003c/strong>: The way I’m thinking about this is, we’re asking the question, is how did we get here? How did we get here to this moment? There is some subtlety to this. Constitutionalists will look at the power of the presidency just as raw power. And I think there’s an important point to that. But we also have to think about, it’s different to issue executive orders or to move — use your presidential authority to do things that are consistent with human rights, and to do them in ways that are inconsistent with human rights. And so, Obama has a mixed record. So some of the things that he’s done, for example, what did he do uniformly without the consent of Congress?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There’s DACA, which is something that Congress uniformly rejected. There is getting the Department of Justice out of doing contracts with private prisons. Those are things that he didn’t ask Congress for. Well, he asked Congress for DACA, but he didn’t need congressional consent to be able to move some of these things. Now, what I wish he had done, would have done the same thing with respect to Guantánamo. But with Guantánamo, he took the opposite approach. This is the approach of, I’m gonna only be able to go as far as Congress lets me. So, I’m saying that there are different ways that we can think about this presidential power, and I know it’s dangerous to say it’s good to use the power for good and bad to use the power for evil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nonetheless, we should be clear that there is a very big difference between the type of things that we’re expecting now under this administration that is consistent, I think, with unitary presidency, as President Obama did with drone strikes, than it is to think about some of the positive things that the president can do consistent with a broader human rights framework, even though constitutionally, it may cause some problems.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Vince Warren is the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, and Faiza Patel is from the Brennan Center for Justice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Brother Ali\u003c/strong>: Bismillah. Brother Jeremy, it’s Ali, also very honored and humbled to contribute this. Bismillah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our hearts were torn apart just like y’all was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Every time we called your office, you ignored us. And now you’re holding hearings on us all inside of Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Microscopes on us and asking for jihadists.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Patrick Henry said it best, “Give me liberty or death.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I shall never accept anything less.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You claim innocence and you played victimless, but you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Slavery and theft of other nations till the end of pacifying your citizenry with excess.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We believe in freedom, justice, and security, but they’re only pure when they’re applied universally.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So certainly, if I preach against the machine, my aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry, urgently putting fear inside your heart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They want to burn Korans and tell me not to build a mask.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Me and my wife and babies, we ain’t never made jihad, except we touch our head to the floor and talk to God.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The greatest threat of all doesn’t come from any bomb, but the moment you refuse the human rights for just a few.

Coming up, we’re gonna talk to two former special agents with the FBI and get their take on Trump’s Muslim ban, on surveillance in the age of Trump, and on Trump’s love of torture. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music Interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: This is Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill in New York. Be sure to check out our website, theintercept.com, where we have a lot of in-depth investigative reporting. And this week, we published an incredible series of investigative articles about the FBI. And of course, Donald Trump is now going to be heading up a vast surveillance network internationally, but also at home. And these documents, which we published under the banner of the FBI’s secret rules, it’s more than 1,000 pages of secret FBI documents showing their surveillance tactics, how they entrap people in these terror plots that the FBI seems to be so good at breaking up. And these entrapment campaigns are increasingly aimed at Muslims. And right now, to discuss that, I’m joined by two people, Mike German, who is a former FBI special agent who worked on covert operations and actually infiltrated radical right-wing white supremacist organizations. And I’m also joined by our editor-in-chief, Betsy Reed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Betsy, I wanted to start with you. There’s a historical context to this that has to do with the Church Committee that exposed U.S. covert operations inside of the United States, surveillance operations inside of the United States. Now Donald Trump is going to inherit these vast surveillance powers. What did you find in this investigation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Betsy Reed\u003c/strong>: In the wake of the Church Committee exposing all the abuses of mostly the Hoover era of the FBI, a number of restrictions were put in place on the powers of the FBI. And those restrictions were intended to prevent the kind of overreach that involved the infiltration of political and religious organizations, and all of the scandals that came to light in the mid-’70s. In recent decades, that system of rules and restraints has evolved. The problem is, it has evolved largely in secret.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So that’s why what The Intercept is publishing today, which is a package of almost a dozen articles, along with copies of three crucial manuals, including the FBI’s overall governing rulebook, known as the DIOG, and classified policy guides for counterterrorism and confidential informants. And this gives us and the public a vital glimpse of how the FBI understands its own power and understands the constraints on its own power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Mike German, you worked for a decade and a half in the FBI. You infiltrated extremist right-wing organizations. You were one of those agents that had to go undercover and use some of the tactics that were developed in the decades that we’re talking about when we talk about the Church Committee investigations. What’s your concern about what is revealed in these documents and the policies of the FBI?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mike German\u003c/strong>: What I found doing that work is that the legal structure that was created by Attorney General Edward Levi to prevent the abuses during the Hoover era were actually effective in making sure I was focused on the right people, right? You can imagine going into a group of neo-Nazis. Not too many people who you’re gonna find that you like or have any sort of agreement with. But I had this structure where I had to document my reasonable suspicion that each individual I was interacting with was likely to commit some federal crime or had committed some federal crime. And that simple practice of having to sit down and look at the evidence and say, wow, you know, I can write up two sheets on this guy, and I can’t come up with two sentences on that guy. My investigation should shift toward the people where I have the best evidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what I found was that was effective not just for protecting the rights of people who were just venting their spleen and holding views I didn’t agree with, but for making my cases effective in finding people who were actually going to do harm. So what I saw shortly after 9/11 was an attack on that system of guidelines that limited or focused the FBI with reasonable suspicion towards suspicionless gathering. And what’s so clear in these new documents is how the FBI is targeting people not because of evidence of wrongdoing, not with clear legal standards like probable cause and reasonable suspicion, but are granted an awful lot of leeway to conduct very aggressive investigations against people who are not thought to have been doing anything wrong, now or in the future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: So when people hear about the FBI has broken up a plot where there were some Muslims who attended a particular mosque in New Jersey, and they were trying to buy explosives to take into another state to blow up a Jewish community center, what should the critical thinker be looking for there or being skeptical of when we hear these kinds of reports, which we hear all the time now, of the FBI breaking up these terror plots involving Muslims?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Right. And a lot of what you see now is not plots to commit an act of terrorism, but just to travel abroad to a conflict zone. And that’s — we’ve branded that in certain countries as this very dangerous activity, when the evidence doesn’t actually show that. But for the actual sting operations, they create a plot. Typically what I look for first is, was there involvement of any real terrorist group? Second, if there isn’t any contact with a real terrorist group, whether the defendants obtained weapons on their own. In this country, it’s very easy to get weapons. And the idea that you would have a group that was — that we were going to label as a terrorist group that had never on their own sought to obtain any kind of weaponry is a huge clue to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Before 9/11, if I had suggested this group were about to commit some act of violence and they had not a single pistol, that would have been hard to swallow. So one of the things that troubles me isn’t just that the FBI now is willing to provide weapons, which we really didn’t do prior to that, but they provide very sophisticated weapons. We have military grade plastic explosives, surface-to-air missiles, these kind of things that blow completely out of proportion the threat that was actually posed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: What I think you can see in all those cases you described, which The Intercept has reported on extensively, the use of basically what amounts to entrapment schemes to make it seem like they’re busting this high-level terrorist plot, but it actually turns out to be some sort of hapless guy in his mother’s basement. And in the manuals that we have and that we’re publishing, is the evolution of the FBI from what people used to think of as the guys who were protecting you against organized crime to a massive domestic intelligence operation that operates way more — in way more similar ways to the CIA and the NSA than to the police. And that’s really, at the broadest level, what you can see in these manuals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I want to read part of the overview that Betsy Reed wrote with Glenn Greenwald, just to give a sense of the kinds of information that’s revealed in these documents. “The bureau’s agents can decide that a campus organization is not legitimate, and therefore not entitled to robust protections for free speech; dig for derogatory information on potential informants without any basis for believing they are implicated in unlawful activity; use a person’s immigration status to pressure them to collaborate, and then help deport them when they no longer are useful; conduct invasive assessments without any reason for suspecting the targets of wrongdoing; demand that companies provide the Bureau with personal data about their users in broadly worded national security letters without actual legal authority to do so; fan out across the internet, along with a vast army of informants, infiltrating countless online chat rooms; peer through the walls of private homes, and more.” Mike, your response to that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: That’s exactly right. The guidelines, the attorney general guidelines that govern the FBI’s authorities were changed four or five times since 9/11, the most drastically in 2008, when this category of assessments was brought on, that requires no factual predicate. There are no facts that are required before an agent can start a very intrusive investigation that involves recruiting and taking informants. It could involve physical surveillance. It could involve covert and overt interviews. And an overt interview doesn’t sound like a very intrusive tactic, but when you see how it’s used in practice, where an FBI agent goes to your workplace and interviews your boss about whether you’re a terrorist. Maybe goes to your landlord and interviews your landlord and your neighbors about whether you’re a terrorist. That could have a serious effect on your life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So these are powers that, what we’ve found through the Hoover era, need constraint, particularly since the 2010 inspector general report revealed the FBI agents are often making their own allegations to justify preliminary investigations. So, just as you suggested, the idea that an agent might look at some political group they’re opposed to and say, well, is it potentially possible in the future that somebody within this group commits a federal crime? Of course it is. That’s true of all of us. But that’s all that’s necessary to justify very intrusive investigations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, and I remember talking to you back in 2014 when we obtained the government’s secret rulebook for watchlisting people. And one of the, I think, stunning statements in there was that agents can nominate someone to be classified as a known or suspected terrorist, even in the absence of concrete evidence or irrefutable facts. And so the whole thing is very Orwellian. Not to be cliché, but it is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: Not to mention the fact that they have incredibly powerful tools of surveillance at their disposal, including Stingrays, otherwise known as cell-site simulators. They have infrared technology that can allow them to, in some cases, look through the walls of private homes, and a range of other very powerful tools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: And at the same time, we had a push toward information sharing between the agencies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: And so what you have is the NSA engaged in some very broad collection programs that the FBI agent sitting at his desk now has access to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: And that’s a revelation, actually, of our series. That’s a story about name trace requests that can be issued even on the basis of an assessment, which requires almost no basis for suspicion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: And I think it gets to this concept of domestic intelligence being somehow divorced from law enforcement, right? That if we’re doing something for an intelligence purpose, there aren’t really the same constitutional limitations on the activity that’s being conducted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR\u003c/strong>: So, I just would want to say one thing in fairness to the FBI. I mean, it’s very clear, looking at these documents, that there are very few limits on its ability to pursue terrorism investigations. There are constraints that are a legacy of the Church Committee era on its ability to violate what are clearly First Amendment protected activities. And you can also see throughout the document a very keen awareness of the Constitution, right? And the FBI, in response to questions from our reporters, has given a series of explanations of their constitutional justification, how they understand their ability under the law and the under the Constitution to conduct this whole range of activities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we’re very critical of that, but it is worth acknowledging that they do actually, in theory, respect the Constitution. And I do think that at this moment, when we have a president who is basically an authoritarian — I don’t think there’s much evidence that he even understands what the Constitution is —  I think a lot of people are actually looking to the FBI to be the guardians of our constitutional rights when it comes to these matters. So that’s why this series and these documents are so important for the public to see, because if this is the last stop, our last defense against unconstitutional searches and seizures, we need to understand exactly what the FBI sees as its authority and the limits on that authority.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Mike, just because we have you here, I wanted to ask you your assessment of how these executive orders that Trump is churning out like they’re his tweets — the banning of people from seven countries, some of the comments he’s made on torture — is that actually going to make the country safer, or is it gonna affect the agents who did the kind of work that you did in a negative way? What’s gonna happen as a result of this from your perspective as a law enforcement professional?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: I think it’s gonna make things much worse and much more difficult for law enforcement and intelligence officers. I mean, having been inside groups that planned terrorist acts, you’re giving fodder to the terrorist groups that would target you to argue that, yes, this is a cultural war. This is a religious war. This is something that we have to stand up to now because if we don’t, they’ll only get stronger and have more weapons directed against us. So I think it’s gonna be entirely counterproductive in our efforts abroad, but also our efforts here. These sorts of things, we’ve moved from dog whistles to overtly racist —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Sirens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Drudge siren every day at the White House with the racism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: And that will encourage an element within the violent neo-Nazi far right. So it’s really a horrible way of going about it, particularly since we’re living in an age that is really of such incredible historical security, right? The violent crime is way down from where it was, the amount of terrorism over the last ten years is far lower than it was in the 1970s when I first started looking to go into law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, you’re clearly not reading the president’s tweets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Which is the real news these days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Exactly. So we have this strange situation where terrorists are trying to use fear as a weapon, and rather than mitigating that fear, our government is amplifying it and increasing it even beyond all reason.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Right. I mean, Trump has found a way to unite ISIS and the Ku Klux Klan in mass celebration of some of his initial policies and executive orders, and I think that’s a very good indication of why this is so dangerously wrong. The fact that those groups are celebrating it as a victory in their respective causes says a lot about what Trump is actually doing here. Mike German, a former special agent in the FBI. Thank you for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Our editor-in-chief, Betsy Reed. Thank you as well. And I’d direct people to theintercept.com to read this spectacular series with a lot of great reporting from Cora Currier, Trevor Aaronson, and others.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MG\u003c/strong>: Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Okay, so as we dissect the Trump administration’s extremist agenda, these executive orders, I do want to say — and it feels weird to admit this — that there is something I actually find refreshing about Donald Trump. And that’s his use of the word torture. Now, Trump is 100 percent right to call waterboarding torture. A lot of Republicans and Democrats, none of them will say this. I’m glad Trump doesn’t use the term enhanced interrogation techniques or EITs. He’s calling it what it is. But that’s where my praise of Donald Trump ends because Donald Trump is proudly using that term, and he’s saying he loves torture. He wants to make torture great again. Now, as I’ve listened to the president and his advisors talk about this issue, I’ve thought a lot about Ali Soufan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ali Soufan is a career counterintelligence professional. He spent years as a special agent in the FBI. He was one of the most aggressive investigators of the cells and the individuals that went on to be the key plotters of the 9/11 attacks. And in the immediate aftermath of those attacks, Soufan was on the frontline trying to bring to justice the people that supported, enabled, plotted the 9/11 attacks. And he had a plan to interrogate them, to extract information that could lead them to the next bit of information. But what he found was that the CIA starts intervening and snatching the prisoners away from the FBI. Why? Because they want to take them to black sites where they could torture them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ali Soufan joins us right now. And before we get to this issue of Trump and torture, I wanted to get your thoughts as a counterterrorism agent, as a law enforcement professional, on Trump’s executive order banning refugees and people from these seven countries from entering the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ali Soufan\u003c/strong>: Any kind of blacklisting countries like this will probably ruin effective local partnerships that are already in place. When you’re operating in conflict zones in places like Yemen or in places like Iraq, or Syria, or Libya, you need local support. You need local help. You need people to assist you, to translate for you, to show you the lay of the land. Unfortunately, if this ban is seen as an anti-Muslim ban, or if this ban is blacklisting a whole entire population that will end up fighting back on the much needed local cooperation that we depend on in areas like Iraq, and Syria, and Libya, and other places.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And what do you make of — President Trump is — he doesn’t use the term enhanced interrogation technique. He openly has said that he thinks, and this is his word, torture works.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS\u003c/strong>: The thing is not — as you know, Jeremy, it’s not about how you feel. It’s about the facts. It’s interesting that he’s not calling it EIT, or he’s not putting any lipstick on a pig. He’s just trying to sell a pig to the nation. And I think there are an overwhelming support to the idea that torture is not only illegal, but it’s also immoral and ineffective. Congress has spoken, and I don’t believe we’re gonna see Congress going back and changing the law in order for President Trump to carry his executive order.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: For people that don’t understand the difference between a smart interrogation technique and torturing people, waterboarding them, etc., could you just tell the story of your interaction when you had a high value target, what you would have done with that individual, and what ended up happening with the CIA?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS\u003c/strong>: So basically, when you sit down with a terror suspect, you need to have a deep knowledge about the organization, about where he fits in the organization, what’s going on. And you need to play a poker mental game with them, a chess mental game with them, in order to develop some kind of a rapport that will allow him to give you information. A lot of times, they don’t give the information because they want to give the information. A lot of times, they give the information because they think you know the information based on the interaction that you have with them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The advocates for torture, they always refer to the case of Abu Zubaydah, a terror operative. He worked closely with Al Qaeda, even though he wasn’t an Al Qaeda member. He was arrested in 2002. And the whole torture program, or the so-called EIT program, was based on his interrogation. Abu Zubaydah provided all the intelligence that he provided way before waterboarding, and way before EIT, and way before torture. And then, they implemented the torture program. And after that, they claimed that all the information that they got from the torture program — sorry, all the information that Abu Zubaydah provided was information that they got because of the torture program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There were many investigations that took place by the Senate, by the military Armed Services Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the CIA inspector general report, the Department of Justice report. And everybody concluded that there was no actionable intelligence that was generated because of torture. Abu Zubaydah lied. After 83 sessions of waterboarding, he claimed that he was a number three of Al Qaeda, even though he wasn’t an Al Qaeda member. And later on, when they went back to him and they said, “Why did you lie?” He said, “Well, you were torturing me. I told you what you want to hear.” You don’t want to get the information that you want to hear. You want to get the truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Now, what is your assessment of if Donald Trump — and I know he’s saying, well, I’ll defer to the sensibilities of Gen. James Mattis. But of course, Mattis is the defense secretary. He is not in control of the CIA. So the door is still left open for Trump to authorize tactics. What is your sense of if people would follow those orders? Because you read op-eds where they say, oh, no CIA officers would do this. And yet, there are certain elements within the CIA that, I think, would be very on board with reinstituting these same techniques that were used under the Bush/Cheney administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS\u003c/strong>: Well, I think the situation is a lot different today than it used to be in 2002. When I was fighting torture back then, you did not get a lot of support, you know? Sometimes you feel that you and a couple of your colleagues are alone fighting against the whole system. But today, the situation is very different. Today, you see people from across the spectrum, Republicans, Democrats, people in Congress, people in the intelligence community, the military. You have 176 military officers who wrote a letter to Trump about how harmful torture is to our national security. So now the situation is a little bit different. We have way more support than we had back in 2002 when we stood up against torture. People in the FBI, CIA, and the Pentagon.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other point that I want to make here, which makes this time also a little bit different, is the law. Because of 2002, because of EIT torture, Congress acted a legislation — enacted a legislation basically outlawing these kind of techniques, and outlawing torture. So now, if anybody did do these kinds of tactics, this is against the law, and it’s considered a criminal act. That did not exist before in 2002. So, you know, the president can put any executive order that he wants, but in order to change the law, he needs Congress, and I really doubt you’re gonna have a congressional debate that authorizes the president to use torture. Because, as you mentioned, correctly, he is not even using EIT or waterboarding. He’s just saying torture. I would like to watch that hearing and see how they will try to sell it to the American people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Ali, thank you very much for taking the time to do this. I really, really appreciate it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS\u003c/strong>: Good luck.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Ali Soufan is a former special agent with the FBI. You can check out his book, “The Black Banners.” Now, as we end today’s show, we wanted to share a bit of the surreal world of NSA operatives with you. When we started The Intercept a few years ago, one of our primary missions was to analyze, sift through, investigate, and report on the documents provided to us by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. And among the most bizarre of these documents are those from an internal NSA newsletter called SID Today, Signals Intelligence Directorate Today. It’s like their private little newspaper. And this newsletter contains first person accounts from NSA staffers detailing their adventures around the world. And as Trump promises to fill Guantánamo back up, we thought we’d share one NSA staffer’s enthusiastic review of life at Gitmo, but not for the prisoners.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Peter Sarsgaard\u003c/strong>: A temporary duty to Guantánamo Bay. December 22, 2003. An early start can have you climbing John Paul Jones Hill to the Joint Task Force skiff while taking in a beautiful sunrise over the Caribbean Sea, and Camp Delta looming austerely below on the southern coastline. After a hustled day of tackling a myriad of issues and directly contributing to the global war on terrorism, one might be inclined to drive out to Phillips Park and enjoy a gorgeous sunset over the leeward landing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, the day would not be complete without the frequent iguana encounter. Few work environments offer such an opportunity — a rewarding challenge with incredible surroundings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The mission of JTF GTMO is to conduct detention and interrogation operations, to collect and exploit intelligence in support of the global war on terrorism, to screen detainees, and to support law enforcement and war crimes investigations. The interrogation focus at Guantánamo is strategic. Tactical questioning is accomplished in theater to see what they know, categorize them accordingly, and determine what requirements they can satisfy. The work can be extremely interesting, challenging, very fulfilling. On a given week, the NSA LNO might pull together intelligence to support an upcoming interrogation, formulate questions and strategies for the interrogation, and observe or participate in the interrogation. Afterward, the LNO captures and disseminates pertinent technical information gleaned from the interrogation back to the NSA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Outside work, fun awaits. Opportunities abound. Watersports are outstanding. Boating, paddling, fishing, water skiing and boarding, sailing, swimming, snorkeling, and scuba. No experience, no problem. Learn how to operate a boat in a weekend. Become a certified open water scuba diver within weeks. If you’ve already mastered these skills, or once you do, the MWR Marina rents boats, from pontoon party boats to Carolina skiffs, ski boats to kayaks. Recently, they’ve added sailboat rentals, too. The local dive shop has all the gear and tips to ensure a perfect outing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Water sports not your cup of tea? There are many other activities to round your day off. The library has two dozen Internet terminals and over a thousand videos. Or, take in a movie at the outdoor theater, featuring a weekly variety of the latest releases. Other activities include pottery, hiking, nature walks, biking, paintball, martial arts, tennis, racquetball, basketball, softball, and bowling. There are also several swimming pools and gyms, or just relax and take in the warmth of the sun.

Well, we are not even a month into Donald Trump’s reign, and we’re getting reports that the White House has become a strange dystopic land of empty corridors, scores of unfilled positions in the West Wing and elsewhere, visitors wandering around after their meetings not able to find the exist. When Trump is not lounging around in his bathrobe watching television.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe. Definitely doesn’t wear one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Or on Twitter, denouncing the so-called federal judge who ruled against his not-Muslim-ban Muslim ban.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> It’s common sense. You know, some things are law, and I’m all in favor of that, and some things are common sense. This is common sense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump has continued on a strangely schizophrenic policy agenda. Now, on some policies, such as the building or expansion of Israel settlements, he now seems to be veering toward Obama’s policies, which he’ll probably try to say, “Oh, well, this was my policy all along.” His administration claims to be backing off of the pledge to relaunch or reconstitute CIA black sites, where a lot of torture happened under the Bush/Cheney regime. Trump also, from his Twitter feed and the attacks on the federal judge, seems to actually not understand how the federal government works, the system of checks and balances, the fact that we have three branches of government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Schoolhouse Rock:\u003c/strong> Talking ‘bout the government and how it’s arranged.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Divided in three like a circus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump also has been very active on the military front in some ways. At a dinner last week with some of his top advisors, including former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, who now is on the National Security Council, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a famed warrior with decades of military experience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Wrong!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump authorized his first known covert action, and that was this disastrous raid in Yemen. And of course, we know that one Navy SEAL was killed. Several other U.S. service members were wounded, and more than a dozen women and children were killed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS:\u003c/strong> This was a very, very well thought out and executed effort.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And one of the more serious things that happened in recent days is that Trump sent his national security advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, out to speak to the White House Press Corps. And Flynn basically, in a kind of scene reminiscent of Al Haig saying, “I’m in charge,” Flynn basically took us to the brink of a war with Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gen. Michael Flynn:\u003c/strong> As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Just before the Super Bowl last Sunday, the world witnessed the latest chapter of “Donald Trump says something bluntly accurate about the United States’ role in the world?” Just as he did with his critique with the U.S. invasion of Iraq during the election campaign, Trump, in this big pumped up special that Fox News was doing, spoke to Bill O’Reilly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill O’Reilly:\u003c/strong> Putin’s a killer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> A lot of killers. We got a lot of killers. What, you think our country’s so innocent? Do you think our country’s so innocent?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BO:\u003c/strong> I don’t know of any government leaders that are killers in the American –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Well, take a look at what we’ve done to — we’ve made a lot of mistakes. I’ve been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BO:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Mistakes are different than —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Made a lot of mistakes. Okay, but a lot of people were killed, so a lot of killers around, believe me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I will give Trump credit. Trump is right about U.S. hypocrisy and the U.S. record of mass killing and killing innocent people. But this is similar to Trump’s opposition to the Iraq War. Trump, yes, he condemned it. He — although his record is a little bit cloudy on when he condemned it and how much he condemned it, but he did condemn it during the campaign. But now he’s saying, “Oh, well, we should go back into Iraq and take its oil by force.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Well, we should have kept the oil when we got out, and you know, it’s very interesting. Had we taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And his comments to Bill O’Reilly about the U.S. this time around, they were right, historically accurate. But they were offered in defense of his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is indisputably a thug and a murderer. While the Trump carnival plays out on Twitter, and on Fox News, and at the White House press briefings, and on Saturday Night Live.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> You said ban! You said ban! Now I’m saying it back to you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bobby Moynihan as Glenn Thrush:\u003c/strong> The resident tweeted, and I quote: “If the ban were announced with a one-week notice…”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MM:\u003c/strong> Yeah, exactly. You just said that. He’s quoting you. It’s your words. He’s using your words. When you use the words and he uses them back, it’s circular using of the word, and that’s from you. [Audience laughing]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The more important story is actually happening behind the scenes. And it’s not on Trump’s Facebook page, and it’s not on his Twitter feed, and it’s not coming out of some thought that popped into his head while he’s lying around in his bathrobe. It’s who Donald Trump has tapped to run the vast national security apparatus, the U.S. war machine. To discuss this, I’m joined by journalist Allan Nairn. Allan is one of the best investigative journalists in modern U.S. history. When I first got into journalism, he was one of my role models. Since the 1980s, Allan has investigated CIA-backed death squads in Guatemala, in El Salvador. He exposed the CIA’s death squad in Haiti in 1994. Allan also survived, along with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now, a massacre in East Timor in 1991 at the hands of U.S.-backed Indonesian forces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Amy Goodman (1991):\u003c/strong> The Indonesian Army converged in two places.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Allan Nairn (1991):\u003c/strong> Hundreds and hundreds of troops.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Some 270 East Timoris were gunned down, and Allan had his skull split open by Indonesian troops wielding U.S.-supplied M16 rifles. Allan has regularly exposed the CIA’s role in the killing of civilians and in crushing popular movements. Allan, let’s begin with looking at who Trump has tapped. What’s your analysis of who these people are and how it’s going to impact U.S. policy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Allan Nairn:\u003c/strong> Well, the idea that Trump is more peaceful, a maverick, is just nonsense. His team consists of old establishment killers and neo-cons, and some conspiracy nuts. Gen. Mattis, his secretary of defense, was invited to speak at both the Democratic and Republican conventions. He was the preferred candidate for president of Bill Kristol’s #NeverTrump movement. He decided not to take the plunge. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, is a virtual protégé of Jim Baker, the co-chair of the Bush establishment. Vice President Mike Pence was the point man in the House for Dick Cheney, who endorsed Trump. Pence was Cheney’s appointment in the House on both Iraq and the Patriot Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then you have Gen. Flynn and Pompeo, who are rabid rightwing partisans, conspiracy nuts. Flynn is a bitter harsh critic of Obama. But his criticism is that Obama didn’t do enough assassinations. Obama dropped more than 100,000 bombs and missiles. That wasn’t enough for Flynn. And Pompeo comes from a similar angle. He wants unbridled surveillance. He wants a domestic, massive database on Americans. He wants to expand Guantanamo. He wants more torture. If necessary, he wants to rewrite the Army Field Manual, which would allow more torture, not just by the CIA, which uses it as a guideline, but also within the Army and the Armed Forces as a whole.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Trump talks about working together with Russia to fight terrorism, that means more operations, more violence. And probably more significantly, the Trump people want to rip off the constraints. They want to adopt, essentially, the Russian Grozny rules, which essentially says kill them all and kill their families too. Gen. Flynn in particular is a great admirer of that. And Gen. Mattis became famous in the military for his open advocacy of killing. He has a whole string of very colorful quotes where he talks with great gusto about how wonderful it is to kill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. It’s “fun to shoot some people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And in particular, as an illustration of his approach, he presided over the Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre in Iraq, up near the border with Syria, in 2004, in which more than 40 people were civilians at a wedding party, were massacred by his U.S. forces. And when he was asked about it, he was unapologetic. He was asked, “How long did you deliberate before ordering the attack?” He said, “30 seconds.” So the idea that this is a shift in a less — and you could go on down the list — some kind of less bloody direction is just not accurate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is there really, in your view, a rift between Trump and the CIA, the likes of which is just nonstop being pushed by the Democrats and on television?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> No. Not on significant matters. There certainly is on the emotional level. There are tremendous hurt feelings. The CIA people are furious. Nobody likes to be called — compared to the Nazis. But on basic matters of policy, whether you’re allowed to kill civilians; whether aggressive, not legally sanctioned actions in foreign countries are permitted; they’re in complete agreement. It’s ironic that Trump is making this move of entente with Russia at the moment, when Russia has temporarily surpassed the U.S. because of their operations in Syria, as the number one mass killer of civilians in the world. I mean, for decades, the U.S. has clearly and unambiguously held that title because of all the paramilitary and regular Army and intelligence forces around the world that the U.S. supports who kill civilians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But now, because of what Russia has one on the side of Assad in Syria and with their own direct bombing operations, which indiscriminately crush civilians, they have clearly surpassed the U.S. as the number one mass killer at this moment. But you have to keep your eye on the hard facts. And the hard facts are that Trump is clearly going to continue the U.S. policy of being willing to kill civilians. And if anything, his alliance with Russia will only make that worse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Given that you’ve spent basically your entire adult life pursuing the CIA and its clients, pursuing generals and war criminals and paramilitaries, what do you say to people who are — who seem to be now promoting the idea that the CIA, that they’re the good guys?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> You shouldn’t be defending people who kill civilians. The liberal and Democratic shift away from probing criticism of the U.S. military and the CIA started years ago. It started in the ‘80s, really. And for just tactical political reasons, they decided to start celebrating the military and the intelligence agencies. And now, it’s reached this really absurd point where, for one thing, they’re making a differentiation between Trump and the intelligence agencies, when on matter of substance, there is none. And for another, they’re holding these agencies, which systematically commit crimes against defenseless civilians, up as paragons. And it’s just nuts. And I think one of many reasons why Trump was able to break through politically, in addition to his being a master propagandist and a master liar — I mean, he ranks with the master propagandists of history, with Goebbels, with Bernays, with Roger Ailes. I mean, he’s up in the pantheon. But one reason was that he would occasionally blurt out truths that hit home with people, like when in the Republican debate, he stood up and started denouncing the invasion of Iraq and saying it was based on lies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We now have this situation where some people think that Trump is somehow going to shake up the system for the better. And all indications that he’s going to shake it up for the worse, because this is really the most radical elements of the oligarchy, kind of the criminal fringe of the U.S. oligarchy, the crudest criminal fringe, embodied in Trump himself and his old associates taking over the government. And they’re basically unconstrained. They will be especially unconstrained two years from now if they’re able to win a veto-proof Senate majority, which they may well, because it just so happens there are many more Democratic seats exposed than their are Republican seats in that Senate election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, if he succeeds in getting in, first, his new Supreme Court nominee to replace Scalia, which will restore the old balance, which will put Kennedy in the driver’s seat in the Supreme Court; but then, if he gets a second Supreme Court nomination — and I predict that in short order, they’re going to start a massive campaign against Ruth Bader Ginsburg, attacking her as old, crazy, infirm, has to be moved off the bench. Remember years ago, there was the Rightist campaign to impeach Justice Douglas? I wouldn’t be surprised to see a similar move made against Bader Ginsburg.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When Trump chose Mike Pence — I’ve been looking at Pence for a number of years — some of the things that came to my mind were Pence’s incredible proximity to Dick Cheney.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> His relationship with the neo-cons and with the real career lifer powerbrokers like Cheney and Rumsfeld, who really sought out, on one of their life’s missions, which was to create a dictatorship of the executive branch when it came to counterterrorism, policy, foreign policy, military policy, CIA. They wanted nothing to do with oversight from the Congress. When you heard that Mike Pence was selected as Trump’s running mate, what message do you think that was sending to the establishment in the national security apparatus, and within the broader Republican Party?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, the message was, don’t worry, I’m one of you. Appearances to the contrary and insults to the contrary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, I think you know the story of how this happened, because I don’t think Trump went through a Rolodex and said, “Oh, let’s get my buddy Mike Pence here.” It seemed to me like there was a deal made where, this is your running mate. ‘Cause I don’t think Trump even knew much about Mike Pence at all before this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Well, you know, who knows how it came about? There’s always very complex bargaining involved in these things, and all these reports saying at the last minute, Trump had regrets and wanted to pick Chris Christie, who was kind of his buddy. But Trump dragged the ultra-right oligarchs kicking and screaming into power. They could never win an election on their own. Paul Ryan is never going to be elected president on his platform of destroying Social Security and Medicare and all programs for the poor. That’s a loser. So in order to implement their program, they need a degree of popular support. And Trump provided that. But he provided that in ways that weren’t entirely to their liking.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, they had to sacrifice the TPP. It was a painful but lucrative bargain for them, because yes, that hurts their interests to an important extent, but they get even more back in massive corporate and state and personal income tax cuts, and in a massive wiping away of environmental labor, consumer protection, antidiscrimination, financial regulations. It’s a huge net plus for the corporate class. Trump was constantly denouncing the rigging of the system. His basic message was the system’s rigged. Our system is a killer system, and it’s corrupt. All of which is true, except the rigging took place in the opposite direction, which he portrayed. But it’s uncomfortable for the establishment types to hear that, especially coming out of the mouth of their own candidate. And Pence was a bit of a reassurance to them, I think, that don’t worry, it’s going to be okay. You have your inside man. And you see, as he’s picking his Cabinet, there’s no one, absolutely no one in there who clashes with their program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What about Trump’s relationship with the heads of state of other nations? Specifically, I’m referring to the longstanding U.S. system of client states around the world. One of the first things they did was to throw their support, the Trump administration, behind Gen. Sisi in Egypt. What do you see happening with the Trump administration’s relationship with some of these key client states around the world?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Part of Trump’s attack on the existing world order, the order that was created by the U.S. in the wake of World War II, Trump attacks that whole world order. But he attacks it because, in his view, it’s not harsh enough. It’s not repressive enough. Trump says that the U.S. is being ripped off by its clients, by its satellite states, by its allies. So he wants to impose even harsher exploitation. In Jerusalem, Trump is talking about moving the U.S. embassy there, a move that is not going to go unanswered by the Palestinians in the street. Trump is moving toward a system where force is used more directly. When it comes to repressive rulers to el-Sisi of Egypt and Duterte, who was democratically elected, but who got elected on a death squad platform, and he and his forces have so far murdered thousands of people, what we can expect to see is that forces like this, death squad forces, repressive militaries, repressive paramilitaries, which have been backed for many decades by the U.S. — the U.S. has already been backing these forces. The U.S. will continue backing these forces, but without constraint.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now with Trump, I don’t think the reaction among the worldwide killer forces has been that immediate, partly because around the world, a lot of people are a little confused about Trump. But as it becomes clear, as people like Pompeo and Flynn and Mattis go into action, I think we’ll see a similar increase of killings by local death squad and military and paramilitary forces, just because they feel unconstrained, just because they feel the support from Washington, as opposed to what has been the traditional U.S. posture for a number of years, which is give them weapons and training with one hand, but admonish them with the other. The Obama administration was helping Saudi Arabia. There were actual U.S. personnel there helping them with targeting of their bombing runs, where they were hitting one Yemeni civilian target after another, and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And refueling the Saudi planes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Yeah, and refueling. And it was U.S. munitions and U.S. plans, and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Cluster bombs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> In this mass slaughter operation. But as some of the worst atrocities got publicity, the Obama administration felt compelled to pull back some of the advisors, and to issue critical statements, even though the flow of military aid was never completely stopped. It was just temporarily cut back. Now that –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Or the audacity of Samantha Power, who was Obama’s ambassador to the UN. I mean, the kind of gall to stand there and denounce the war crimes that are being committed with the full support of the United States, it’s — I mean, it’s not stunning, but it is — it’s just dripping blood of hypocrisy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Yeah. But hypocrisy has a certain virtue, and that is, at least it’s advancing or acknowledging — and to a certain extent, advancing some good values.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, that’s kind of a metaphor for the entire Obama time in office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it is. Well, the whole — the recent path of the U.S. establishment, because some constraints have been imposed on them by popular pressure, by human rights activism. So they feel obliged to say publicly, yes, killing civilians is a bad thing. But under the table, here are some guns. And we see you killed a thousand civilians last month. Okay, here’s some more guns. Maybe try to be a little more careful. It’s been that mixed stance. And that kind of mixed stance is something that local generals sometimes find infuriating. But even more significant, it’s something that they find they can exploit politically. So you have these officers standing up a demagogically denouncing the United States because the United States is criticizing them on human rights grounds, even though they’re pocketing one U.S. weapons shipment after another, and they’re all going to Fort Benning and Fort Bragg for their training, and they have CIA personnel sitting in their intelligence centers helping them with their operations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the Trump people clearly favor an approach which strips away the hypocrisy, and more — in a more straightforward fashion, says support our friends like el-Sisi, like Duterte. And what de facto that means is full speed ahead on the killing without constraint.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Allan, thank you very much for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AN:\u003c/strong> You’re welcome.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Allan Nairn is an investigative journalist. His website is News and Comment. It can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://allannairn.org\">allannairn.org\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I’m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don’t want ‘em here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump has been signing executive orders like bad checks. And much to our disappointment, the definitive source for all things law and history that is Donald Trump’s Twitter feed, it didn’t provide us with any insight into the veracity of these little presidential grenades. So we asked Intercepted’s distinguished alt-historian Jon Schwarz to educate us on the roots of this mysterious, yet often-used, presidential prerogative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jon Schwarz:\u003c/strong> You’re a concerned citizen. So recently, you’ve been wondering, maybe for the first time ever, what are presidential executive orders? Given that we’ve learned they can change the lives of thousands of people in one second, you might not be happy to find out that the answer is, no one really knows.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Congressional Research Service — it’s their job to tell Congress about the history of the United States — says about executive orders that the term has no exact meaning. That’s because executive orders are not defined in the Constitution, and also, there is no specific provision in the Constitution authorizing them. So therefore, the Congressional Research Service says, “ambiguity behind executive orders poses a great concern for Congress and the public.” Okay. So all we really have is 200 years of presidents issuing executive orders and seeing if the other two branches of government, which means Congress and courts, will let them get away with it. Every single president has come up with at least a few executive orders, with only one exception, which was William Henry Harrison, America’s ninth president, elected in 1940. But he probably also would have signed some if he hadn’t, after exactly one month in office, died.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Executive orders can be extremely good. The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order from Lincoln. Harry Truman used an executive order to abolish racial discrimination in the military. Executive orders can also be extremely bad. FDR used an executive order to create the legal authority for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Franklin Delano Roosevelt:\u003c/strong> When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, our West Coast became a potential combat zone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jon S:\u003c/strong> Truman used another executive order at the start of the Cold War to create loyalty tests for government employees, which was really the birth of McCarthyism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Joseph McCarthy:\u003c/strong> The thing that the American people can do is to be vigilant day and night to make sure they don’t have Communists teaching the sons and daughters of America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jon S:\u003c/strong> If you look at modern executive orders, you’ll see that presidents claim their authority is based on two things. First is Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives them executive power, and requires that they take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and then a claim that they are in fact executing some specific law passed by Congress. In the case of Donald Trump’s executive order, shutting the door temporarily or maybe otherwise on refugees and immigrants from seven countries, it was the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> It’s not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared. It’s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports. You see it all over. It’s working out very nicely, and we’re going to have a very, very strict ban, and we’re going to have extreme vetting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jon S:\u003c/strong> If you don’t like what Trump did, the good news is that the Supreme Court has famously said about executive orders that, “when the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.” And it looks like that’s what Trump was doing here, because the law he cited bans discriminating among immigrants on the basis of a person’s place of birth or place of residence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Also, whoever it was who wrote this executive order was super, super incompetent, because the executive order probably violated a 1962 executive order about how you produce executive orders. So it’s possible courts will strike down parts of it, or maybe all of it. And Congress might, might also try to take back some of the power they’ve given the executive branch. But really, the only way that will happen is if Democrats ever have a majority again while a Republican is president. Congressional Democrats have never been interested in taking back power from the president if the president’s a Democrat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And just in general, don’t be discouraged. Scientists now believe that William Henry Harrison, the president with no executive orders, died because there was no sewage system at the time in Washington. This meant that a few blocks upstream of the White House water supply, there was, as the New York Times puts it, a field of human excrement. This gave Harrison typhoid fever. And then the same swamp probably also killed another president, Zachary Taylor, just nine years later in 1850. So never let anyone tell you that regular people don’t have any power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was the Intercept’s Jon Schwarz.

And that was the President, Donald Trump, being disrupted by black lives activists when he was running for president. And he did not like that. Orange is the new anti-black. You know, in figuring out what to do this week on the show, it was like going through a catalogue of fucking horrors. We could go down the line. His atrocious billionaire Christian supremacist Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. His Muslim ban. His ridiculous allegation that news organizations are somehow covering up terror attacks, even as journalists die in record numbers. It’s a veritable cornucopia of sad lies and pathetic memes that are not even worthy of Twitter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In this horrid ocean of terror, I decided to sit down with the brilliant Princeton professor, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor. Now, she’s unapologetic socialist. She’s an activist, and she’s the author of an urgent book called “From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation”. Now, I’ve known Keeanga for several years, and I remember how we both witnessed the air being sucked out of the anti-war and anti-corporate globalization room in the 2004 election when George W. Bush defeated John Kerry and served a second term. But we both regrouped, and we jumped right back into the struggle. Keeanga and I sat down and discussed the Trump moment, the Obama legacy, the politics of resistance, and the failures of the Democratic Party.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor:\u003c/strong> In the last 40 years, when we look at the increasing conservative posture of the Democrats, at the heart of that is the way that they take for granted the votes of their base, whether that’s black people, whether that’s working class women, working class people in general, students. They take that for granted, and consistently try to appeal to more rightwing forces in the country, and do nothing to appeal to the people who are actually turning out and voting for them. And so, the 2004 election was certainly perhaps a low point. I mean, to lose to George W. Bush. But then when you think that you’ve hit the bottom, that you could actually lose an election to the dithering idiocy of Donald Trump, it really — it should be a soul-searching moment for what that party is. But it doesn’t actually appear to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and four years after that, you have Barack Obama, who ran on a pledge to operate the most transparent administration in history. This was the first black person elected as president of the United States, and to this day, a lot of people — when you get into arguments with them about policy, and how did we get here, and look at the drone program, and look at the war on black people in cities throughout this country — people say, “Oh, well, you know, well, but that wasn’t Obama.” And there’s still this, I think, idolizing of the Obama era, particularly within these liberal circles in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> Well, I think that we get completely consumed in the symbolism of Barack Obama and ignore his record, and ignore the actual history of his candidacy.  And so, I wrote the book in large part as a way to understand the meaning of Barack Obama’s presidency, really beginning with the question of, how do we explain the emergence of this black social movement, the sort of longest, most enduring black social movement, really, since the 1960s and ‘70s, with a black president, and with the highest concentration of black political power in American history? So not just the black president, but the black attorney general. And part of it was understanding the way that Obama sort of raised the expectations of African-Americans in a very cultivated way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean, people now say, well, we shouldn’t have expected too much, and that was unrealistic, and he never could have met those expectations, when during 2007 and 2008, it was David Axelrod and Obama who were stoking those expectations, who transformed his campaign. Because African-Americans originally were much more supportive of Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama was someone that people didn’t know and were not familiar with. And he transformed — he was smart enough to understand that if he transformed, if he could transform his campaign to make it seem insurgent, to make it seem as if it were a movement from below that was disrupting the status quo — that he could get people to come along with him. And he did this. I mean, I had never heard a mainstream Democratic Party candidate, you know, give speeches where he’s talking about the Abolitionist movement. He’s talking about sit-down strikes in the 1930s. He invoked the Stonewall Rebellion in the 1960s, and then of course, the Civil Rights Movement, and sort of described his campaign as the logical conclusion of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So there was a great effort in raising the expectations of people. And so, I think that for millions of African-Americans who mobilized to vote for Obama in ways that were historically unprecedented, believed that they would do something in return, as any constituency does who is a key factor in the election of a president. And almost as soon as he got into office, the sort of backsliding, the qualifications, the hemming, the hawing. There was no sort of ten days that shook the world. There was no succession of executive orders and actually following through on anything. Instead, when Obama actually did have a mandate in a way that there’s nothing resembling that with Trump, he did absolutely nothing with it, and instead, sort of wasted that opportunity to just step on the throat of the Republican Party, and put them in a can and bury it in the backyard for a generation, he refused to do it. And we are now living with the consequences of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you say to the not so uncommon line from Democratic pundits or policymakers or their surrogates on social media that, “People like you were part of the problem because you spent all this time bashing Hillary Clinton. You wouldn’t come out and say people should be voting for her because she’s the lesser of two evils?” What would you say to people who say, “Well, then why weren’t you fighting to get Hillary Clinton in instead of Donald Trump?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> Part of the problem with that take, and I’ve heard many different iterations of it, is that it doesn’t actually account for why, on a much broader level, people were so uninspired with Hillary Clinton. It’s as if — if a few people on the left had been sort of more excited about Hillary Clinton, then that would have somehow compensated for the tens of millions of people who weren’t. And so, it’s important to look at why that is. I think that what people forget is that Hillary Clinton, one, had a record, and that it did make an impact on a new generation of black activists, who didn’t know about the Clintons in the 1990s, to discover this history of the particular role that the Clintons played in the rise of mass incarceration and the rise of law and order under a Democratic regime. That was a revelation to many young people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then when the tape came out with Hillary Clinton calling young black people superpredators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hillary Clinton (1996):\u003c/strong> They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators. No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KTY:\u003c/strong> You know, there was a way in which the Democratic Party apparatus and the liberal establishment that hangs on to it just tried to dismiss that as another day and age, as if it were the 1930s and not the 1990s. And what I’ve found most pernicious about that was that I don’t think Hillary Clinton thought that. I don’t think she thought young black people were predators. But Hillary Clinton stuck her finger in the wind in the 1990s and decided to make a political calculation that that would be politically expedient to use that kind of language to describe young black people, and that’s why she said it. And so, I think that for people who have been chastising those of us on the left, I did not vote for Hillary Clinton. I have never voted for a Democrat, and I never will, because I think that that is a party of war. It’s a party of the market. It’s a party of poverty, a party of police violence, of executions and the death penalty, and I will never vote for it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I understand why people do, but I think that as long as the Democratic Party believes that they have your vote in their pocket, they’ll continue to move and act in the same ways. That is a deep problem with the politics and the orientation of the Democratic Party, which is a pro-capitalist, pro-market party in the United States. And so one of the questions that I ask in my book is whether or not this whole — can black people be free in a country that has, as its political, economic, and moral ethos, trenchant support of free market capitalism? As Nancy Pelosi said the other night, “We’re capitalists. Deal with it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nancy Pelosi:\u003c/strong> Well, I thank you for your question, but I have to say, we’re capitalists, and that’s just the way it is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> I think there’s a basic contradiction between what free marketers and the capitalism and black liberation, or women’s liberation, or LGBTQ liberation, or what liberation would look like for poor and working class people. I think that those two things are in dire conflict with each other. And so, when you have a political party that is steeped in that system and loves it, and does everything in its power to maintain and uphold it, then there’s a basic contradiction in being able to come through for the things that ordinary people need to maintain, let alone improve, any standard or quality of life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But I wanted to ask you something. So the neo-Nazi Richard Spencer was punched twice, and there’s all these memes on — you can find on Twitter and YouTube.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> No tears here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And right, no tears for you. Richard Spencer gets punched twice. Then you have this Breitbart acolyte, Milo Yiannopoulos, who — he’s clearly trying to provoke people by going and speaking at these universities, recently speaking in Berkeley. And Antifa activists and others go after that speech. We understand, though, that Milo was going to be calling out undocumented students, and so that’s much more of a complicated narrative than has been out in the media. But I wanted to get your take on this. There are people even on the left who are saying, “These anarchists are part of the problem.” The people that are setting fire and throwing these things, or punching Richard Spencer, that those people also have a right to free speech, even if we hate it. And punching Richard Spencer or torching something outside of a Milo Yiannopoulos speech is not helping the issue. What’s your take on this kind of debate that we’re having right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> Most of us support absolutely the right of a free exchange of ideas, particularly on college campuses, even with people that you don’t necessarily — or don’t agree with at all. So, I think with Nazis, Nazi sympathizers, that it’s a different ballgame, because what they are doing is not just going out to have a fruitful exchange, or even an unfruitful exchange of ideas. What they’re actually trying to do is to recruit people to their cause. They are trying to create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation for anyone who is not a white heterosexual male who thinks like they do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I saw a brief documentary — it’s like a CNN thing — where this trans woman made a really poignant point, which is that if Milo comes to campus and gives a talk, he’s somewhere else the next day. But the people who organized it, the people who came, the people who applauded, I have to sit next to in class. And that’s a problem, because these are people who absolutely support violence. They support the extermination of entire groups of people. And so, I think in that case that it’s not just a simple matter of free speech, that it’s really not being naive and understanding what it is for fascists and Nazi sympathizers, what it is that they are actually trying to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now in terms of black bloc tactics, I don’t think that they’re necessary, and I don’t think that they’re particularly helpful. If we are trying to build a mass movement, which I believe is what we need to form a resistance to the Trump regime on many different fronts, there’s — almost everyone is in the crosshairs, then we need a mass movement. And when you’ve got people who are — whose main intent at a demonstration is to create property destruction, is to create a kind of violent spectacle that invites a confrontation with the police, then that in and of itself is necessarily limiting. It means that undocumented immigrants can’t come on to that demonstration. It means that many African-Americans can’t come on to that demonstration. It means that people who want to bring their families can’t come to the demonstration, and to me, that there’s something fundamentally wrong with that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, it doesn’t mean that we should conflate that with police violence or see it as the same thing as the tactics of the state, because that’s not their intent. These are anti-capitalists who want to confront the system. And I’m obviously very sympathetic with that. So they’re not the same thing. But as a movement, as a left, I think that we have to say something about tactics that imperil the right for the vast majority of people to freely participate in that movement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> From your perspective, what should resistance and mobilizations and organizing look like under the Trump/Pence administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> So, I think the first thing is that we have to start with an understanding and an analysis that all of these issues are connected. And so, the whole kind of, I have my issues over here, and they’re wholly separate and have nothing to do with your issues, is insufficient, and it’s incorrect. For people who are concerned about police terrorism and police violence, that is not just a black issue. That is an issue that Latinos have to deal with. That is an issue that Arabs and Muslims have to deal with. And we have to highlight the ways in which those things are connected. The attack on women’s rights is not just an issue for middle class white women who were the majority at the Women’s March in D.C. and around the country, but the attack on immigrants. This is a woman’s issue. The attack on low-wage workers is a woman’s issue. Fifty-five percent of black workers make under $15 an hour in this country, and most of them are black women.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, we have to see how all of these working class issues are women’s issues. And so, I think the main thing is that we have to see how these issues are connected, and that is the basis upon which we can build a broad movement. it has to be mass, it has to be broad, and there need to be easily identifiable entry points for people, for all these millions of people who are going to demonstrations. They need to know where it is that they can go locally to then get involved. So there are many different dimensions to this. But it will take all of them to be able to create a resistance to the Trump regime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, thank you very much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KYT:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is a professor at Princeton University and author of the book “From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation”.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we end today’s show, we are going to go to a spoken word segment.

Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There are all sorts of reasons why Mike Flynn should not have been the national security adviser, but that’s not why he’s going down.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Keith Scott:\u003c/strong> But times were just as tough halfway across the drawing in the former Soviet satellite of Pottsylvania, where Rocky and Bullwinkle’s archrivals, Boris and Natasha, and their fearless leader, Fearless Leader, were cooking up their latest scheme for taking over the world when their plans were crushed by the fall of the Iron Curtain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Boris:\u003c/strong> What’s going on?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He’s going down because of the phone calls that he had with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during the transition period from Obama to Trump.

Trump fired her as the acting attorney general when she stood up to his Muslim ban. Sally Yates apparently, back in January, had raised the Flynn phone calls with the White House and said that there were discrepancies between what Mike Flynn was saying in public about what he discussed with Russia’s ambassador and what intelligence intercepts of those calls had documented. Now the New York Times is reporting that the FBI interviewed Mike Flynn just days into his time as Trump’s national security adviser. Now, if Flynn lied to the FBI, he could be hit with felony charges. All of this should be investigated, no doubt. But something else seems to be at play.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Senate Republican leaders are now increasingly joining in with the Democrats in saying, “We need to investigate this Mike Flynn scandal.” And the White House now is starting to pile on with the narrative that, oh, this was all naughty Mike Flynn. And they seem to be in the beginning stages of a campaign to dump all the Russia shit onto the U.S.S. Mike Flynn and sink it once and for all. Now, that’s not likely to succeed, especially given the state of commentary in the U.S. media, the hysterical posturing of the Democrats and their cheerleaders in the media on this Russia story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Joe Scarborough:\u003c/strong> A storm is coming, and it’s coming fast, and it’s coming hard.

Glenn, what is your thinking on all of this Flynn shit?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald:\u003c/strong> I think there’re several interesting points. Obviously, if somebody gets caught lying to the public on a material matter, as Gen. Flynn just did, they ought to be fired. I wish that standard had been applied during the last two administrations.

Ron Wyden:\u003c/strong> Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>James Clapper:\u003c/strong> No, sir.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> And yet kept his job through the end of the administration. And so I’m glad to see that there’s now accountability for lying to the public. I also think it’s extremely interesting and important to note that the reason we found out that Flynn lied was because somebody inside the U.S. government committed a very serious felony in order to make sure that Gen. Flynn didn’t get away with lying, and that namely is somebody who leaked the contents of intercepted telephone calls from the NSA when they were spying on the conversations of Russian diplomats. For the past eight years, anybody who leaked information against the law was regarded as a criminal or a traitor, somebody who deserved to be punished. For some reason, the person who exposed Gen. Flynn is now being celebrated as a hero, which I think it s correct. And it underscores that sometimes people who break the law in order to leak information are acting justifiably and nobly, and we ought to celebrate them when they expose corruption on the part of government leaders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think what this does not do is vindicate a lot of the hysteria about Russia. It doesn’t show that Gen. Flynn was some sort of Russian spy. It doesn’t show that the Kremlin has blackmail leverage over Trump or any of those sorts of things. But it does show that Flynn lied, and therefore lost his job, justifiably.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And we also have this reality that’s playing out on the cable networks and in the papers and on Twitter where you have this sort of authoritarian Trump tweeting, “The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on North Korea,” etc. And then you have the Democrats celebrating what they perceive as the intelligence community standing up to Donald Trump. And you had this article by the former NSA something or another, John Schindler, asserting that the NSA is withholding intelligence from the Trump administration because Trump has an open spigot to the Kremlin from the National Security Council. But I find it particularly ironic that the Democrats are celebrating these leaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> Leaks related to national security can put people at risk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Given the President Obama shattered the combined records of every one of his predecessors for prosecuting whistleblowers under the Espionage Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, you are at the center of really, one of the most important leaks of the last — of the war on terror — which was the Drone Papers. And I was at the center of another extremely significant leak, which was the Snowden NSA reporting. And so both of us constantly heard from Democrats that anybody who leaked classified information is a criminal and potentially a traitor, and ought to be imprisoned. MSNBC continually justified and even cheered for the Obama assault on leakers and whistleblowers by saying that anybody who leaks classified information without authorization deserves to go to prison. And yet, now they just do a 180, as partisan hacks always do, and they start cheering for it because this leak undercuts not a Democratic president, but a Republican one. And suddenly, they find it heroic and noble. I mean, this is just craven partisan dishonesty of the worst kind that we’re seeing as visibly as we can possibly see it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Hannity:\u003c/strong> Well, Julian Assange, fascinating. I do hope you get free one day. I wish you the best. Thank you for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Julian Assange:\u003c/strong> Thank you, Sean.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG: \u003c/strong>And we see it on the other side of the equation too. People like Laura Ingraham and people at Fox News support Trump, were very supportive of WikiLeaks through the campaign. They were supportive of the Snowden story. And now suddenly, they’re indignant over the fact that someone leaked information because it hurt the Trump administration. These are the kinds of hideously dishonest partisans that basically ruin any integrity or value in political discourse. We all know who they are and have seen them over and over. But I guess at the end of the day, you have to just take your allies where you can get them. And even if the motives are really lowly and warped and malignant, it is true that whoever did this leaking did the right thing, and we ought to be thankful for them, regardless of what the motive was of that leaker, whether it was to destroy Gen. Flynn because he’s a threat to the deep state, or whether it was because they want to harm the Trump administration because they’re viewed as threatening of the CIA’s agenda. Whatever the motive was, the outcome was justifiable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And then — and of course, you know, the official organ of “the resistance,” MSNBC and the NBC network, they did another thinly sourced, anonymous official’s story saying that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> The Russian government is considering offering fugitive Edward Snowden as a gift to President Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> But at the end of the day, it creates complications for the new administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> Complications that might arise during a Snowden trial, like re-opening the debate about American surveillance and civil liberties. Good for the Russians. Last year, Mike Pompeo, now CIA director, said prison was not enough for Snowden.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CIA Director Mike Pompeo:\u003c/strong> And I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, that’s another perfect example. If you evaluate that story with even minimal amounts of critical faculties, what you instantly see is that this storyline about how Trump should get Putin to trade Snowden as a gift actually originated not from the Kremlin, but from the factions of the CIA who were squarely behind Hilary Clinton, in particular, former acting CIA chief under Obama turned Hilary Clinton surrogate Mike Morell, who a month ago wrote an article saying Trump should convince Putin to hand over Snowden as a gift. And then lo and behold, magically, this storyline appears a month later, planted in NBC by of course an unnamed official, claiming that in telephone conversations that they tapped or email communications that they read, they heard Kremlin officials plotting to hand Snowden over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, maybe that’s true. Maybe the Russians just happened to be planning exactly the thing that Mike Morell, a month ago, advocated. But given that there’s no name on the story, given that it’s coming from the intelligence community, which is created to disseminate misinformation; given that the intelligence community despises Edward Snowden and could easily be using this leak to pressure Trump or to put it in his brain, so many potential alternatives, to just instantly treated as true, to just blindly believe that there are now telephone transcripts showing Kremlin officials plotting to hand over Snowden as a gift, all because some unnamed person in the intelligence community said that to NBC news is just gullibility and idiocy of the highest order. And yet that has happened over and over, especially where Russia’s concerned.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Whenever there’s an anonymous leak, everybody instantly believes it to be true. No evidence needed to be presented, as long as it’s pleasing, as long as it bolsters people’s desires and makes them feel good, then it just — anything goes. And we see it over and over. And those are two great examples.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let me ask you, I mean, about this issue of anonymous sources. We at the Intercept, we spent quite a bit of time determining what our policy would be on anonymous sources. And I see often on Twitter, when you make this point, you get attacked, and people say, “Oh, well, you guys use anonymous sources.” And we do in fact, at times, use anonymous sources. We published a massive dump of FBI files. We published the Drone Papers, which was based on a source within the intelligence community that we granted anonymity to. So what is your view of the difference between the varying forms of granting of anonymity that you’re talking about?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Well, first of all, there’s a fundamental, glaring difference between publishing an assertion from an anonymous source, some person saying that something happened. But you can’t see any evidence for it. You can’t touch anything concrete. There’s no way to critically evaluate whether it’s true. It’s just some woman or some guy who refuses to attach their name to it, making a claim versus publishing actual authenticated documents, things that you can touch and feel and read, so you know that they’re real. And what matters in those cases is not where it came from, who provided it, but what the documents themselves actually reveal. For example, had Edward Snowden remained anonymous, his documents would have been just as informative, right? The FISA court order showing that the U.S. government was collecting millions of calls every day from Americans would have been just as newsworthy. And in fact, Snowden was anonymous at the time that document was made public. So there’s a huge difference between anonymous assertions and documents, concrete evidence provided by an anonymous source.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond that, I would say there are times when anonymity is justified. If the source is providing information that’s genuinely in the public interest and would face serious punishment and recrimination in the form of prison, or being fired, or having their reputation ruined, or other kinds of dangers. I’m not saying anonymity is never justified. But whenever, as a news consumer, you see a media outlet publishing an assertion from an anonymous source that’s unaccompanied by documented evidence, you ought to be very skeptical about whether that claim is true because the whole nature of anonymity is that the person is protected, which means if they lie, if they propagandize, if they deceive, they’re protected from all consequences, which is the reason, beyond the fact that you don’t see any evidence for it, that you ought to always be skeptical of anonymous sources, including ours.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And I just wanted to back up to the Flynn thing a second and remind people, one of the great scandals of the post-World War II era on this issue of communications and transitions happened when Ronald Reagan was competing against Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and you had dozens of American hostages being held by the Iranians in Tehran as a result of the Islamic Revolution. And the Reagan people were concerned that Jimmy Carter was gonna pull what they called an October surprise and make a deal that would free the hostages, that would result in tilting the election in his favor. And the story goes that the Reagan team made a secret deal with the Iranians that would result in Reagan being able to take credit for freeing the hostages. And in fact, 20 minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ronald Reagan:\u003c/strong> Some 30 minutes ago, the planes burying our prisoners left Iranian airspace and are now free of Iran. [Audience clapping]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Reagan did a ton of dirty criminal shit. And the point here isn’t that this is the model or that it’s okay. It’s that all of the pearl clutching in Washington about Mike Flynn is really sort of political theater, on one level.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> This idea that people should not interfere in foreign policy — I remember in 2007, when Nancy Pelosi went to visit Bashar al-Assad in Damascus at the time the Bush administration was imposing sanctions on and was trying to isolate the Syrian regime, the big scandal on the right was that Nancy Pelosi ought to be prosecuted under the Logan Act for interfering in the Bush administration’s foreign policy. The reality is, the Logan Act is a really troubling and oppressive statute that has never been used to prosecute anyone precisely because of how troubling it is. It basically is oppressing one’s freedom of speech, and freedom of petition, and freedom of movement to be able to express one’s views or to engage in political activism. And especially in this case, where Flynn is literally weeks away from becoming the national security adviser, and the Trump administration is about to take over, the idea that they would communicate with other countries to signal what their intentions are — again, maybe it’s a breach of protocol because there’s only one president at a time or whatever, but it’s hardly anything cataclysmic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I do agree that if Mike Flynn lied to the public, he ought to be fired. We shouldn’t have public officials lying to the public about critical matters. But beyond the lying, I really am not bothered by any of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, we should say that it’s not clear if Flynn resigned or if he was actually fired. Did he just lie to Mike Pence, who then passed on that false information to the American public, or did Flynn actually lie to the FBI when they reportedly questioned him about this? Stay tuned. Glenn, we gotta leave it there. Thanks for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> All right, Jeremy.

He’s reportedly even chaired a meeting of the National Security Council, along with Steve Bannon, the white nationalist former head of Breitbart. Trump likes to call them his “two Steves.” These two hateful characters are now in the driver’s seat of a tremendously dangerous car.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hina Shamsi:\u003c/strong> Well, I think the concern can be, in some sense very simple put, which is that what were once fringe, anti-Muslim, extreme views are now in the White House, and are poised to impact policies in ways that I think will be hugely detrimental to people’s rights and to our national security.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That’s Hina Shamsi, the head of the ACLU’s National Security Project. I’ve known Hina for many years. I’ve interviewed her for stories about the watchlist, about targeted assassinations, about Guantánamo. And before the ACLU was raking in tens of millions of dollars in donations to help their battle against Trump’s Muslim ban, Hina was fighting day and night against the Obama administration’s policies, the massive watchlisting matrix, her fight to close Guantanamo, representing the families of people killed in drone strikes during the Obama era. And I think that, like me, Hina is very heartened to see this tremendous groundswell of awareness and action on this issue of the targeting of Muslims and others, but also horrified at why this is necessary right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And among the cases that Hina is currently working on is a lawsuit that was brought by victims of the CIA torture program during the Bush/Cheney era. It’s a suit against two agency contractors who were central to building up this apparatus of torture that was kicked into gear soon after 9/11. Well, a couple weeks ago, Hina was flying back to the U.S. from meeting with her clients abroad, and she found herself in the crosshairs of the very system of being detained and interrogated by the Customs and Border Protection Agency at an airport. She has fought on behalf of people on the watchlist or no fly list, and actually was subjected to the kind of so-called secondary screening that her clients often are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> I want through immigration, and it seemed like an immediate red flag went up. And a Customs and Border Protection agent came and took me to a separate section of the airport behind the luggage carousels and started asking a series of really extraordinary questions. They asked where I’d been and what I was doing, and I explained that I am a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, and that I’d been traveling, as I said, for my work. And the questions then began, a series of them, with, how is it that someone working for an organization with American in its name would have my passport, which is Pakistani. I’m a legal permanent resident and have been for over 10 years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How is it that someone working for an organization, this organization, with American in its name would be representing people who are not citizens, or would be traveling abroad so much, especially if I’m focused on the U.S. Constitution? And it was a series of very intrusive questions related, not in any way that I could see, to establishing my identity or any issue of status or legal ability to enter or not.

Welcome back to Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill. I want to encourage people to check out all of the investigative journalism on theintercept.com. Now, for a lot of people, Donald Trump’s administration is already a horror show. The Muslim ban, the Yemen raid, the suggestion he may resume cluster bomb sales to Saudi Arabia, Steve Bannon’s presence in the administration, not to mention on the National Security Council, the ICE raids, Donald Trump’s failure to know that Frederick Douglass is not a living person who’s doing great things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And on and on and on. And that’s not even getting into Trump’s own personal conflicts of interest. We haven’t even seen the guy’s tax returns. He’s still basically running his Trump empire in between tweets attacking federal judges and the “failing” New York Times. The word impeachment, though, is blowing in the air, and I think those winds are blowing a lot stronger, particularly in light of the Flynn situation. Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, she says it’s not quite on the table, impeachment, but she does seem curious about the issue. Richard Nixon’s White House council, John Dean, said recently, “I don’t think Richard Nixon even comes close to the level of corruption we already know about Trump.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Nixon:\u003c/strong> Because people have got to know whether or not their president’s a crook. Well, I’m not a crook.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, this is a topic that’s going to increasingly pop up in the weeks and months ahead. But is it really a feasible thing? To break all of this down, I’m joined by Liz Holtzman. She is a former congressmember from New York City. She was the youngest member of the House Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach Richard Nixon. Liz, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Former Rep. Liz Holtzman:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy, for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The bookies in the U.K. are putting the odds at two to one that Donald Trump is impeached in his first term. You’ve got almost a million signatures on a petition being circulated by this group Roots Action calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump. Rep. Jerrold Nadler is starting to kind of poke around the issue, looking for an inquiry. But I think that the word impeachment is being thrown around a lot lately, and sometimes in a way that doesn’t seem to have a grasp of what it even means. Explain what impeachment actually is in the context of the president of the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Actually, when we were confronted with the misdeeds of Richard Nixon in 1973, the only impeachment effort that had taken place had taken place almost a hundred years before against Andrew Johnson, President Andrew Johnson. And that had been attacked by historians for the hundred years afterwards. It was very partisan, and it was a failure. So all of us had to go and start reading the Constitution, and reading English history books, and all of that. Impeachment is not something that was taught in law school, at least when I went to law school. But it’s a practice that derives from ancient British history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let me tell you why this is in the Constitution. The framers wanted a Democratic society. And so, we had election of the president. Of course, it wasn’t direct. You have the Electoral College. But people got to vote. Not everybody, property holders, no slaves, so forth, women. But the framers also did not want a parliamentary system. They didn’t want a system where a president could be removed from office. And on the other hand, they knew that presidents could do very bad things while they were in office. They knew that presidents might, because they were human, steal, cheat, take bribery, connive with foreign governments, do all kinds of bad things. And since they had an election every four years for president, what would happen to the country if you had a president who committed treason, or engaged in bribery, or did very bad things in the middle of his term? You’d have to go on for another two years, another three years, another four years, even, with such a president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So they knew they had to have a system to remove a president from office who was engaging in bad, bad, bad acts. But on the other hand, they didn’t want to make it easy to remove a president ’cause they didn’t want a parliamentary system, and they wanted a strong president. So they had to kind of balance it. As a result, they made impeachment a very cumbersome and difficult process, which is why there’ve only been three times in the history of this country where impeachment has been attempted, and only once where it succeeded.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How does impeachment work? It’s a process that starts in the House of Representatives, which acts like a grand jury — issues what’s similar to an indictment. Here’s what the president did that was bad. And then it has to go to the Senate, where there’s a trial. The chief justice of the Supreme Court sits on the trial. And you need two-thirds of the Senate to convict. In other words, it’s very tough, under any circumstances, to get a president removed from office. First of all, people are reluctant to throw out a president, so you have to get a majority in the House of Representatives, and you’ve got to get two-thirds of the Senate to agree. And the Constitution’s very specific about the grounds for impeachment. You cannot remove a president from office through impeachment because you don’t like his policies, or because his behavior is bizarre, or because you disagree with him, or because his actions are despicable. Those are not grounds for impeachment. The only grounds are treason, which is defined in the Constitution; bribery, which everybody knows what that term means; and the third term is other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That’s a very mysterious term because we don’t know what a high crime is, much less a high misdemeanor. We don’t use that language. That language derives from ancient British law, ancient British practice, where they could impeach executive officials. A high crime and misdemeanor, in my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, is basically a political crime, a serious, grave abuse of power that threatens the basic workings of our government. In other words, it’s a president who does something not trivial, but something serious that affects people’s rights or the operation of our laws, and that’s not authorized or is an abuse of his power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What rose to the level of high crimes when you worked on the impeachment of Richard Nixon?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> What triggered the impeachment inquiry, and that’s a very important thing to understand, was the American people. It wasn’t what happened with Bill Clinton, where the Republicans in Congress said, “We’re gonna go after the president,” stimulated by the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who had no business recommending that impeachment action take place. That’s how that started. It started out by the recommendation of a special prosecutor, and then the Republicans said, aha, now let’s go get Clinton. And in the end, the American people never bought that. They said, “Hm, well, we don’t think that whatever he did, as bad it was, was serious enough to warrant impeachment.” It didn’t involve an abuse of the powers of his office. He lied under oath about his relationship, sexual relationship, with an intern. It didn’t involve the abuse of the powers of his office. He never used the powers of his office. And it didn’t really threaten the functioning of our government, of people’s liberties.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What happened with regard to Nixon was that it was discovered that there was a taping system in the White House. Richard Nixon wanted to keep track of his conversations, so he set up a taping system. And of course, the special prosecutor who had been appointed after the burglars had said there were higher ups involved in Watergate, Archibald Cox a Harvard Law School professor, said, “I’m going to go and try to get those tapes.” Well, Nixon knew what was going to happen, and he ordered Cox to be fired. Well —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Chancellor:\u003c/strong> Good evening. The country tonight is in the midst of what may be the most serious constitutional crisis in its history. The president has fired the special Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox, and he has sent FBI agents to the office of the special prosecution staff and to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general and the president has ordered the FBI to seal off those offices. That’s a stunning development, and nothing even remotely like it has happened in all of our history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> The American people said, “Uh-uh. This is not America. We’re not a banana republic. Prosecutor has to be able to search for the truth, no matter where.” And so, Congress was flooded with phone calls, telegrams, letters, people screaming and yelling. The American people said, “Enough of this. Congress, you have to do something about this president.” And the evidence included, ultimately, the tape recordings of President Nixon’s White House conversations. And they show beyond any doubt that he was involved in both criminal activities and serious abuses of power. But what happened was, one of the tapes was called the “smoking gun tape.” And that tape showed that Richard Nixon orchestrated and directed the cover-up. What he said on that tape was he ordered his top aid, Haldeman, to call the CIA and tell the CIA to stop the FBI investigation into Watergate, into the break-in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So that was both a kind of a crime because it was an obstruction of justice, obstructing the effort of the FBI. It’s also a serious abuse of power. It’s misusing the power to order the CIA to do something that it had no business doing, that was solely — not for the wellbeing of the country, but solely to protect Richard Nixon from being prosecuted and found out in terms of his criminal activity. So you had the standard for high crime and misdemeanor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We’re not even a month into the Trump administration. What do you make of these calls for impeaching Donald Trump at this point?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> First of all, the impeachment would be extremely difficult. Remember, you need a majority in the House of Representatives. For them to vote against the president is going to be extremely difficult because they’re going to have to explain to their constituents, most of whom voted for Donald Trump, why they did this. It will only happen if the evidence, as it was with Nixon, is so overwhelming that the American people say, enough. But if impeachment is political, as it was with regard to Bill Clinton, it was totally partisan. That was not the impeachment effort that went into the removal of President Richard Nixon. That was bipartisan from the beginning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The chair of the House Judiciary Committee and the members of the House Committee understood that Nixon’s conduct was really threatening the republic, our democracy, the rule of law, the constitutional system that we had. So if we wanted him removed from office, we had to make sure that the process was fair, was totally legal, was backed by full evidence, and that we had Republican support, because the American people were not going to buy overturning an election by Democrats, even though we controlled the House. We had the votes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. Is there anything that is in the public realm right now that you can see as indication that there would be the kind of crimes being committed by Trump or his administration that would rise to the level of impeachment?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> I think there’re some very troubling signs. I don’t see any impeachable offenses at this moment, but I see that there’s a possibility that we could have them in the future. Why do I say that? What caused Nixon’s downfall was his arrogance about being president. He thought he was above the law. Once you put yourself above the law, then you are asking for trouble. He thought he could cover up, he thought he could abuse agencies. He thought he could use — break-in to people’s homes, wiretap without warrants, pay no attention to what the law required. That was his downfall. We see signs of that with regard to Donald Trump. For example, the denigration of the judiciary, trying to bully them, trying to denigrate them, shows a real contempt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> “So-called judge.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Yeah. “So-called judge” — political. They need to do their job. They haven’t done their job. That kind of thing. It’s not an impeachable offense to denigrate a judge, but it’s a sign that he thinks he’s above the law. That can get him into trouble. Similarly, when he fired —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sally Yates?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Sally Yates, the acting attorney general, because she was doubtful that the executive order on refugees was lawful, he didn’t say, “Hey, what are her concerns? I mean, do we have an unlawful statute? I want to get it to work. Let’s try to find out what her concerns are.” Nope. He ignored them. Again, a sign of contempt for obedience to the law. I’m not saying that it was illegal or an abuse of power to fire her. I think he had the right to do that. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I don’t think it’s an impeachable offense. But it’s this kind of a mindset, I’m the top dog, and the whole system has the kowtow to me, and I don’t have to make my laws lawful because people have to obey them. I’m the president. That’s a very bad sign at the beginning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One other thing are his financial entanglements. One of the grounds for impeachment is bribery, treason, other high crimes and misdemeanors. Bribery could mean taking money from somebody knowing that they’re trying to influence you. It doesn’t mean you have to act on it, but simply taking that money might be engaging in bribery. Well, if you haven’t separated yourself from your hotels, and you’ve got people staying at the hotels, for example, who are doing so in order to get you to change position on the pipeline, is that bribery? And so, you may start getting issues of bribery with respect to who’s paying money to the hotels. And then all that money that goes into the hotels goes into his pocket.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Does he know who’s staying in his hotels? Does he — does he understand that this is really buying influence? It’s similar to campaign contributions, but those are exempted. This is not exempted. So could we be having large-scale efforts at bribing Donald Trump? And his participation by not walling himself off from this could create really serious problems. It’s not a conflict of interest issue. It’s not an ethics issue. I mean, it could be those things. But seriously, from my point of view, it could be bribery, and then we are getting into constitutional impeachment grounds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’ve been hearing rumblings that there are powerful neoconservative figures that are in Dick Cheney’s circle of influence that have started discussing the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment to the Constitution and the idea that maybe Mike Pence could end up ascending to the throne before Trump’s first term is over. What scenario could lead to Mike Pence becoming president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Well, I’ve looked at the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment, and it was adopted in order to fill the vacancy of the vice president. But it also allows for the president, if he’s suffering from some illness, or has to go the hospital, or has some heart attack and is under anesthesia, or something like that, to relinquish the powers of his office temporarily, and then regain them. That’s been done. It was done by Ronald Reagan and maybe other presidents as well. And we’ve filled vacancies in the vice presidency using the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment. The 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment, however, has a provision for the involuntary removal of the President of the United States. But it requires consent by the vice president and the heads of executive departments. So you can’t just have Mike Pence saying, “I want to be president,” and saying that Donald Trump is unqualified to be president in order to be removed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, what if Donald Trump decides he’s bored with this? It’s not like running my company, and I’m just gonna — I’m gonna go back to hosting “The Apprentice” and running the Trump organization.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> He can always resign. Richard Nixon resigned, and then, of course, the vice president becomes president. But if, for example, people felt that the president’s behavior were really a sign of instability or mental instability, and enough of the cabinet members agreed with that, there could possibly be a way of removing him. However, the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment is very badly drafted, and the president could say, “Well, I’m really fine, so I’m gonna take back the powers of my office. Then it would go to the House of Representatives for a vote. So it’s a very, very cumbersome process. I guess Pence — if the president really behaved in an even more extreme and eccentric and bizarre way than he’s behaving now — many people think he’s unstable now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you think that’s possible?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it’s possible, but I think —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That he could be more erratic and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I think it’s possible. But I do think that the procedures are not spelled out. And would Pence take advantage of them because he’s the one who’s going to benefit from it? It would look very, very troublesome, I think. And how would he be able to say that Trump is not mentally balanced when he can’t have an examination? So you’d have to get Trump basically to agree to be examined by a psychiatrist. Is that going to happen? So I’m not sure that that mechanism is gonna work. It’s worth exploring because I think there really are issues of stability, but how you’d make it work is another issue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you think people should be looking at right now, or your sort of final thoughts about where we are as a country in this moment with Trump in power?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> The bizarre behavior of Donald Trump already reflects, I think, one area where he has actually abused his powers, his office, in a serious way, affecting the liberties of the people of the people in the United States. And that his attack on Nordstrom. Nordstrom is a private business, and it’s allowed to sell to whomever it wants to without discrimination. And it’s allowed to carry whatever kind of clothing and sell whatever clothing and advertisers it wants within the law. Donald Trump using the powers of his office as president cannot attack that business. It’s an abuse of power. He used the presidential Twitter operation to attack Nordstrom. We can’t have a president basically threatening a private business, attacking a private business. That becomes — it’s an abuse — it’s a misuse of the powers of office for private purposes. This is to, you know, ensure that his daughter is making money. Well, that’s fine and good. He wants to do that? He can’t do it as president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there’re some things that he has to give up as president, and that is to use — to try to defend members of his family by using the power of the presidency. That is a very serious thing that he’s done. Even one of the Republicans said that he finds this over the line. And if he continues this kind of behavior, attacking private businesses or private individuals using the power of his office for personal gain or personal gain of his family, those could be impeachable offenses. It’s completely wrong. I hope the situation will get worse for Donald Trump in the sense that the American people will come to their senses about him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Thank you very much, Liz.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Last weekend, Donald Trump was chillin’ at Mar-a-Lago, the “Winter White House,” as Sean Spicer likes to call it. It was the culmination of the live tweeting of his maxin’ and relaxin’ with Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, with whom Trump shared yet another awkward as hell handshake to kick off their weird bro comedy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I said, “Come on, Shinzo. Let’s go over and say hello.” [Crowd laughing]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mar-a-Lago ain’t Camp David, and you are not welcome there. But for $200,000, you too can go and watch Trump meet with foreign leaders. In fact, this weekend, elite club members were able to capture a bunch of pictures of what would normally be secret meetings between two heads of state. Trump was Instagrammed, tweeted, Facebooked, as he went over details, we understand, of North Korea’s surprise missile test. While he was sitting there with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, waiters were removing dishes and cleaning the tables, and they’re looking at classified documents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KFC Television Commercial\u003c/strong>: You’re going at it all wrong, son. You’ve got to go to Kentucky Fried Chicken if you want to catch America’s favorite chicken.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Trump’s genius clique of advisers were actually filmed using their own mobile phone flashlights to help Trump and Abe see these classified documents. Now, Trump and his advisers may not know this, but at least one app for smartphones for a flashlight has actually been used by Chinese spies to spy. One of the pictures taken by someone in the club that night also suggests that Trump is still using his old, insecure Android phone to take calls and post tweets. Now, that is an easily hackable device.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Trump is brazen in his disregard for both the ridiculous formalities of being commander in chief, as well as those that are probably in place for a good reason. His main mission seems to be to promote brand Trump through the White House and to cash in. I’m joined now by Naomi Klein, and very excited to announce that she is joining us here at The Intercept as a senior journalist. And she’s gonna be covering the Trump administration. Naomi, we’re all very excited to have you on board. Welcome to the crew.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Naomi Klein:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy. I’m excited too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you make of the kind of mini scandal right now of Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump and their product lines, and Trump attacking Nordstrom’s, and Kellyanne Conway pitching for people to buy Ivanka’s clothing on Fox &amp; Friends while she was in the Brady Room at the White House?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> This week has definitely made it clear that the United States doesn’t have a first family; it has a first family of brands. And there is a series of stories — I mean really, this has been clear from that first photograph, but well before inauguration, when Ivanka was seen meeting with her father in a Japanese delegation, and afterwards, it was tweeted out that people could buy the bracelet that she was wearing from the Ivanka line. And Melania’s bio on the White House website originally plugged her accessory line that you could buy on the Home Shopping Network. But yeah, there’s been a lot of news just in the past week related to this entanglement, this family of brands.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There was the story that U.S. taxpayers will be picking up the tab, $100,000 in hotel bills for Secret Service and other government staff to be part of Eric Trump’s entourage when he went to Uruguay to promote the Trump brand. Then of course, there was Trump lashing out at Nordstrom’s for dumping Ivanka’s brand — unfairly, according to him; because it wasn’t selling according to the company. And other stores have done the same. You have the broader grab your wallet campaign targeting Trump’s businesses. And Trump’s tweet about Nordstrom was soon upstaged, and some have suggested purposely upstaged in order to deflect attention, by Kellyanne Conway.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kellyanne Conway:\u003c/strong> This is just — it’s a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully—I’m gonna just give it — I’m gonna give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody you can find it online.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And the general consensus was that this was kind of as blatant as ethics violation as they come. So it’s clear that Donald Trump doesn’t actually have children or family members; he has brand spinoffs or sub-brands. And Ivanka’s brand seems to be a softer female version of the ruthless boss-man brand that Trump himself as developed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ivanka Trump\u003c/strong>: Hi, everyone. I’m Ivanka Trump, and thank you for tuning in. I’m incredibly excited because I want to share with you today some of my favorite styles from fall. And while it’s very —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> You know, it was, I think, telling that in his infamous tweet about Nordstrom, he said, “Ivanka is a great person, always pushing me to do the right thing.” So that, I think, says something about her brand, her brand identity, to which the world can only reply in unison, “Push harder, Ivanka.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And final thing to get your thought on: There are reports that Donald Trump is very flustered at the fact that he can’t run the U.S. government like he ran his businesses. But what’s your overall perspective on Trump as commander in chief, Trump as president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I think if he did run the U.S. government, the way he ran his brand, it would be — it would represent a complete hollowing out of the U.S. government. Which I think is what we can expect from them, which is a continuation of trends over the past 40 years, and certainly, trends that you’ve covered, Jeremy, with the outsourcing of the military. What’s important to understand about Trump is that he is really a hollow brand in the sense that the Trump brand, which is — they say is equated with luxury and quality, but really, his brand is the embodiment of the boss, the embodiment of wealth and power. There are lots of brands that embody quality and luxury much better than Trump. His brand is this very garish expression of pure wealth, of pure capitalism, right? And this is why it’s so gaudy, with the sort of gold everywhere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Then it’s a deal?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IT\u003c/strong>: Yes, we eat our pizza the wrong way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT\u003c/strong>: Crust first.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> So what do you think of my Trump Home Mattress collection by Serta? Finally, the same luxury and comfort I demand in my hotels.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Donald Trump. We’re all cut from the same cloth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I’m really big on dressing for success. Impeccable attention to detail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Trump Steaks are the world’s greatest steaks, and I mean that in every sense of the word.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And what’s important to understand about that is that, yes, he does own a few centerpiece properties, but the business model that he has is to lease this brand, whose value he increases through publicity. The huge boost for the Trump brand was The Apprentice, which was incredibly high profile, free — not just free marketing. He was paid for the marketing of his brand and the consolidation of his image as the ultimate boss who can do whatever he wants. The presidential campaign further solidified that. But any sense that you can disentangle the Trump brand and what is good for the Trump brand for the U.S. presidency is completely absurd.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you look at this trip to Uruguay, the scandal to me is not simply that the U.S. taxpayers are paying for the Secret Service. The issue is that what Eric Trump was doing in Uruguay was selling the Trump brand to developers for many millions of dollars, and that’s the main business that the Trumps engage in, is selling that brand to developers, leasing the value of that brand. And the value of that brand is increased every day by Trump embodying the ultimate powerful position of the U.S. presidency. And we’ve already seen them leveraging that, increasing membership fees at Mar-a-Lago and so on. So the whole presidency itself is a conflict of interest. And the idea that there is any possibility of disentangling this misses the whole point. The point is the conflicts of interest. We are living inside of Trump’s reality TV show now, which is projecting, broadcasting live from the Oval Office. We might think of it as President Apprentice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And when I call it a reality TV show, I’m not belittling the fact that there are massive stakes and people will die in this reality TV show. But I would just point out that people dying in reality TV shows is one of the most common sci-fi tropes that we have. I mean, if you think about The Hunger Games, the whole concept is a massive, all-encompassing reality TV show in which the stakes of the game is that everybody dies except for one person. So I think it’s not — it’s a pretty helpful model for understanding that we are all in Trump’s Hunger Games now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, well, Naomi Klein, we really look forward to your reporting, your investigations, your commentary joining us at The Intercept.

Transgender Americans are being targeted in record numbers as Attorney General Jeff Sessions moves to quash LGBTQ rights. ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio and former New England Patriots star Donté Stallworth talk about the war on the transgender community and the rising resistance of pro athletes. Sam Biddle exposes the Trump-connected firm set up by the CIA that helped the NSA spy on the world, and actor Wallace Shawn stars as an NSA operative who is worried about adversaries spying on his luncheons.

And Risen faced imprisonment for refusing to give up his sources. I’m gonna talk to him about Trump’s declaration of war against a free press.

The FBI is now involved and investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hate crimes against transgender people are on the rise, particularly trans women of color. Last year was the deadliest year on record for transgender people in the U.S. There were 27 murders, most of them against trans women of color. This year, there have already been three reported homicides of trans women, all of them women of color. And these are just the cases that we know about that were reported. Last year, lawmakers in 34 states introduced more than 200 anti-LGBTQ bills. At least 50 of those targeted transgender people specifically. Now, part of the propaganda that’s being pushed to defend the smearing and dehumanization of trans people centers around gender nonspecific bathrooms, or whether trans women have the right to use the women’s room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick:\u003c/strong> You can mark today as the day that Texas is drawing a line in the sand and saying no. The privacy and safety of Texans is our first priority, not political correctness.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>National Organization for Marriage Ad Narrator\u003c/strong>: Any man at any time could enter a women’s bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gov. Pat McCrory:\u003c/strong> Allow boys to use the girl’s locker rooms and showers. Are we really talking about this? Does the desire to be politically correct outweigh our children’s privacy and safety?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Massachusetts Family Institute Ad Narrator\u003c/strong>: Our legislators are really going to make it legal for men to use women’s bathrooms to somehow help transgender people. But that makes no sense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This idea that’s being promoted is that it’s going to put real women at risk. It’s gonna put children under the threat of being attacked. Now, this line of law and order, we need to protect the women and children — it’s long been the rallying cry of those who seek to dehumanize others as part of their broader agenda of hate. Not so long ago in this country, black people were portrayed as nonhumans, and were lynched because they allegedly smiled or whistled at white women. Law and order.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Trump administration now, on an official level, is accelerating the campaign against LGBTQ people, and it’s moving to roll back some of the Obama-era gains.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> The president has maintained for a long time that this is a states’ rights issue, and not one for the federal government, that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in. This is a states’ rights issue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it’s not just the White House or lawmakers around the country and their legal, legislative war to strip or deny the rights of transgender people. It’s also fueled by public mocking or shaming of trans people — a rejection of their humanity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Milo Yiannopoulos:\u003c/strong> But I think that women and girls should be protected from having people — men who are confused about their sexual identities in their bathrooms. That person —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill Maher:\u003c/strong> That’s not unreasonable. Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All of this helps to normalize and even encourage the violence unleashed against them. To talk all about this, I’m joined by two people. Chase Strangio is a staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT and AIDS Project. Chase is one of the leading lawyers spearheading the fight against these discriminatory bills nationwide, and is also one of the lawyers representing the imprisoned whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who herself is a transgender woman. In addition to the legal battles that Chase is helping to lead, it’s also personal for Chase. He is transgender.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I’m joined by Donté Stallworth, who played ten years in the NFL as a wide receiver. He’s been very outspoken on LGBTQ issues and also on U.S. foreign policy. All right, so Donté Stallworth, Chase Strangio, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dont\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>é Stallworth:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chase Strangio:\u003c/strong> Yeah, thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, Chase, let’s begin with you. Give us an overview of the reality facing transgender communities, people in this country, both from a legal perspective, but also with regard to hate crimes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, I think we’ve seen tremendous progress for the trans community over the last five, 10 years, but the reality is, I think, in sort of three key metrics, things are pretty dire for the community by and large, and particularly for trans women of color. On the legal level, we still don’t have explicit protections at the federal level for trans people, so that means no explicit protections in employment, housing, public accommodations. But then we’ve also seen an upsurge in anti-trans laws being proposed, and in some cases, passed, like House Bill 2 in North Carolina. Then, you all —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain what House Bill 2 is in North Carolina.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. So, House Bill 2 is the law that the North Carolina General Assembly, in their infinite wisdom, passed through a special session last March. It was designed to strip localities from expanding protections to include LGBT people in response to what Charlotte had done to protect people. But it also went even further and implemented a discriminatory mandate with respect to transgender peoples’ use of restroom and locker room facilities, essentially saying trans people can’t use the bathroom and the locker room that matches who they are. You have to use one that corresponds to what’s listed on your birth certificate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then going back to two other metrics of conditions for trans people, one is the reality and the drivers of incarceration of the community, particularly trans women of color, which is of course related to the lack of legal protections. But you just see incredibly high rates of police profiling of trans women as sex workers. The data shows almost 50 percent of black trans women have been incarcerated at some point in their lives. The third metric, then, is the individually perpetrated violence. And we see, with more visibility, with more trends, people being out as trans, an incredibly high rate of violence towards the community. Again, particularly targeted toward trans women of color.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the — I was reading through some of the statistics, and the numbers are just spiking. They’re just going through the roof, of hate crimes being committed against the broader LGBTQ community, but specifically against transgender people. What factors are making that a reality? And also, I’m sure that there are a lot of totally unreported hate crimes against people from that whole broad community, but specifically the trans community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, so I do think we just have to start from the assumption that we’re only hearing just a fraction of the numbers because people aren’t reporting them, police aren’t investigating them, and then the media in many circumstances is misgendering people, so nobody ever knows that it’s a trans person that’s been murdered. You know, you can look to so may factors as to why this is happening, but I think one of the key ones, and especially with respect to the uptick, is that with the visibility and these new laws, like HB2, the new rhetoric that is insistent upon calling trans women men, about propagating lies about predatory behavior of trans people, it legitimizes individually perpetrated violence. Because what usually happens is someone ends up in some sort of romantic encounter with a trans person, and finds out that they’re trans, and feels such rage, which is obviously being given to them in a feedback loop by society, and then kills them. And then — or a stranger on the street is so angry that a trans person exists that you see in violence towards that individual.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How many attacks against women or children have there been in bathrooms by — that are committed by transgender people?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> You know, I know of not one incident.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This isn’t a rampant occurrence around the country? ‘Cause there’s some very prominent people that seem to think that this is a plague, that transgender people are preying on our children and our women in bathrooms.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You’re saying that that is not true?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> That is just a patently untrue lie, and it is a dangerous one. And it is one that we are hearing from people. But there’s not a shred of data to support it. And people are looking for that. They would love for there to be lots of examples, and they look everywhere, but there are no examples. And so, all that people are left with are lies and just the reality that, at the end of the day, it’s our job to show that what people are doing is urging that trans people not exist. That is their — that is really want they want, because there’s no truth to what they’re saying. And really, what they’re saying is that trans people are so gross and uncomfortable to me that I would rather come up with a reason why we should justify the violence against them and justify the passage of laws that tells them that they’re not fit to participate in public life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and let’s remember the dehumanization is one of the core early stages of authoritarian regimes, fascist movements, justifying not the official state-sanctioned violence against whoever happens to be the least among that society and the views of the state, but also encouraging mob action. Over and over and over again through history, you see this. And I want to bring in Donté Stallworth, who is an NFL wide receiver. What brings you guys together, in addition to probably some common views, is that Donté played for the Patriots, Chase is from the area up there and is a Patriots fan. I don’t want to increase the amount of hate mail you get, Chase, so I’m gonna have to take care —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> I will take it for the Pats. Anything else, I’ll be annoyed, but the Pats, I will take it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is it okay if I call you a weirdo for being a Pats fan?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> That’s fine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, good. ‘Cause those people do truly baffle me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Tom Brady, great guy, great friend of mine. Great, great champion. Unbelievable winner.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donté, we’re now seeing an incredible engagement from very high profile athletes. We had the recent confrontation of the CEO of Under Armour by Steph Curry, this massive NBA star; Colin Kaepernick taking the knee, which then sparked a lot of other athletes to take action. But now the NFL itself is basically threatening the state of Texas that if it goes forward with the very kinds of bills or policies that Chase is laying out, that they’ll consider taking away future events in the state of Texas. So, your analysis of what’s going on right now within the pro sports community, specific to this issue first, and then we’ll talk about some other ones later.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Well, initially, when you look at — I think there has been an uptick in a social consciousness of professional athletes and even collegiate athletes as well. And I would say that started probably right around the time when the things that were going on in Ferguson with the protests, and players for the St. Louis Rams were conscious of this. Players around the league were conscious of this. And so, when you have players who are starting to awaken to what type of power they have off of the football field, then that is something that can become special, especially when it’s used for a progressive movement. And again, this was all for equality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, moving on to the NFL, this is not something that’s new. Back in 1990, the NFL threatened to take away a Super Bowl from the state of Arizona because they did not recognize and acknowledge Martin Luther King’s birthday as a state holiday, and they did take it away. And in this country, money talks. And so, they came to terms with the NFL. I don’t want to say necessarily with the NFL, but they came to terms with designating the Martin Luther King holiday as a state holiday, and three years later, lo and behold, you had a Super Bowl in Arizona. So the NFL understands the power that they have, and I think they’ve pretty much made it clear what they could do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you look at what happened with North Carolina last year. They lost reportedly up to $600 million dollars, so at the end of the day, the state legislators and the people of that state will have an issue when money’s leaving that state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Chase, how does this all play into what you guys are doing at the ACLU on this issue, the fact that you now have a very large, powerful cultural institution in the United States in the NFL taking this position on this issue?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Are you gonna make me say something nice about Goodell here? Because that is gonna be really hard for me. But no, I mean, I do think that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Donté made the point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, at the end of the day, these guys are ultra über-capitalist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Right. Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it’s also — there’s a political value to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. There’s a huge political value. And I think of course, we’re pushing their hand by organizing movements that are making them — because they know their fan base are gonna make a difference in their bottom line. And so, I don’t want to give — I think the businesses and the institutions are important, but of course, it’s related to all the mobilizing we do on the ground. But of course, yeah, the experience in North Carolina was incredibly helpful and instructive, both in terms of the loss of revenue and McCrory’s lost election. And now, the NFL — the Super Bowl just happened. And now — I do want to ding them a little bit. They — it wasn’t like they pulled the Super Bowl that was there. I mean, that would have been really hard, but they could have done that. And that would have really hurt Texas badly, and they didn’t do that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But even now, just coming in and saying, “Listen, we’re gonna play ball with you, and you’re gonna lose the Super Bowl if you go down — future Super Bowls if you go down this road.” And so, between the NCAA, the NBA and the NFL all wielding their power in this way, you’re not acting in the best interest of your state at all if you’re willing to forego that amount of revenue for the purpose of telling people where to go to the bathroom because of a made-up problem that you’re focusing on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donté, part of your political development was around the issue of homophobia and LGBTQ rights. Maybe talk about how that issue, in a very macho, manly culture of the NFL helped to kind of transform some of your thinking.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I think there’s —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump and those guys like to talk about, “It was just locker room talk when we talk about grabbin’ pussy and all this stuff.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But I’m sure you hear a lot of that in the actual locker room also.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Well, yeah. There’s — it’s definitely not a churchgoing environment. I mean there are instances where guys talk about things that they wouldn’t talk about in public. But, me personally, I grew up kind of in this environment in California where homophobia was rampant in my neighborhood. And it was never in anger or a violent outburst towards gays, but it was just a sense of, like, I don’t want to be around them. And so, luckily for me, I ended up moving to Miami after I was drafted, and there was this restaurant that I frequent called Nobu in Miami. And so I was there all the time, eating sushi, of course. And the waiters and the waitresses and the host, the general managers, I knew everyone there ‘cause I was there literally every day. And one of the waiters was gay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, I invited all of them, ‘cause they were friendly to me, so I invited all of them to come out with me one night. And I remember the couple times that we went, he didn’t come. And so, I asked one of the young ladies who I was probably closest to at the restaurant, I asked her, “Why didn’t he come to the spot with us?” And she said, “Well, you know, because he’s gay, and the whole football macho thing.” And my heart just kind of sunk. Like, am I giving off that vibe? And she was like, “No, it’s just, you know, you come in here with the other big football players, and you come in here with the women, and blah, blah, blah.” And for me, I’ve never looked at myself as a bigot, but then I started to understand how I used to think, because I didn’t want to be around gays. And then, I specifically — next time he passed me, I grabbed him and said, “Hey, we’re all going out later. You should come.” And he said, “Well, I don’t — I’m not sure. I may have a couple things to do.” And so I kept pulling on his coattails and asking everyone else to have him come out, and he ended up coming out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I spent — when he finally got there, we spent like 20, 30 minutes talking, just he and I. And I left there that night — I remember lying down in my bed thinking what a bigot I had been. I was like, this dude is super cool. He’s not trying to talk to me and get my phone number and holler at me — I mean, like the myths you’ve talked about. And I realized how ignorant I was, and I felt so, so bad. And over time, I just realized that I can’t just — you know, I can’t leave it there. I need to start becoming vocal about this because still, a lot of my teammates and friends and even family members were still kind of in that mindset that I had been in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There are several players on the New England Patriots that have stated publicly that they will not go to the White House to meet with Donald Trump. And you were invited on Bill O’Reilly and on CNN to talk about this issue. And there’s a lot of people that say, “Well, people like Colin Kaepernick,” you know, who’s of course the San Francisco 49ers, they should stay out—\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Spawn of Satan. He’s the spawn of Satan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. They should stay out of politics, and that Martellus Bennett and these other people, they basically — all they should be doing for us is performing in the bread and circus. And — but you’ve pushed back against that quite strongly. What’s your argument for why what they’re doing is right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> I mean, I think what they’re doing is right is — I’m a big fan of history. And so, you can go to recent history in 2003, 2004, when Steve Nash wore this shirt in pregame that said, “No war. Shoot for peace,” and was ridiculed for that. And even Skip Bayless, who was at — I believe he was at —I believe he was writing for the San Jose Mercury at the time — just totally ridiculed him and said, “How could you have the audacity to speak your political opinions? You should be more worried about playing in the game.” And these people don’t understand that there are some things more — even though this is a part of our life, this is our occupation, what we do for a living and what we love to do and have dreamt of doing since we were children. But there are some things that are more important than sports.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you look at what Carlos Delgado did in 2004. He did not stand for “God Bless America,” and the same thing. He was ridiculed for that. His reasoning for not standing was — he acknowledged, obviously, the horrors of 9/11 and what happened to the American people in New York City, and at the Pentagon and with the crash in Pennsylvania. But he also acknowledged the lives of innocent Iraqis and Afghanis who were caught in this war on terror who had nothing to do with any terrorism. And he was ridiculed for that. I don’t understand how you can ridicule somebody for trying to bring light to an issue of civilians being murdered that had nothing to do with the war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and you — I mean, and you and I have talked about this before. You go back to the ‘68 Olympics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Yup.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> With John Carlos and Tommie Smith holding up the black leather fist at a time when civil rights leaders were being assassinated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Where open war was being waged against black people, and where rights were being denied. And the U.S. was in Vietnam, and Mohammed Ali refusing to enter the U.S. military, a case that also went all the way to the Supreme Court over his draft resistance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mohammed Ali:\u003c/strong> My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother or some darker people, some poor hungry people in the mud, for big, powerful America. And shoot them for what? They never called me nigger. They never lynched me. They didn’t put no dogs on me. They didn’t rob me of my nationality, or rape and kill my mother and father. What, I’m gonna shoot them for what? How am I gonna shoot them? They’re just poor little black people, little babies, and children, and women. How can I shoot them poor people? Just take me to jail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> A lot of stories of resistance and using your public platform to speak out. I find it interesting that these attacks come from people who also are very passionate supporters of Donald Trump, who is a reality TV personality that has become president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> That seems to be what people are expecting now. And I don’t — when you talk about these things, you just mention, there’s so much historical precedent that is set with all of this, and it’s — when I look at it, it’s like, well, you look at Tommie Smith and John Carlos. The L.A. Times said it was a “Nazi-like salute.” You look at — again, go back to Steve Nash, Carlos Delgado. A lot of these players, even Jackie Robinson, I mean, you can look at history in so many different aspects and so many different sports. But at the end of the day — and of course, the great Mohammed Ali, but at the end of the day, all of these players have been vindicated for standing up for human rights, for standing up for equality, and justice, and peace, and truth. My biggest thing is, be careful when you criticize these players because usually, they turn out on the right side of history, and not the people who are casting their aspersions on them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Chase, when ordinary people say, “What can I do?” about a whole slew of issues, I’m curious what you tell people on this issue that you’re working on right now with all of these fights for transgender people to be given the exact same rights as people of any — of other genders. When you’re in that struggle, what would you say to ordinary people beyond just support the ACLU and give us some money?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, I think first, is exactly sort of what Donté described about his own process with sort of internalized homophobia. I mean, we all have to recognize that whether it’s about communities we’re a part of, or particularly when it’s communities we’re not a part of, that we have work to do to recognize our own biases and discomforts, and sort of really work actively to undo those. And part of that is working within ourselves, and part of that is taking it upon ourselves to educate and engage with others. And that’s really how we move through history, how we make progress. You can win all the cases in the world, but if you’re not sort of fundamentally mobilizing power in the communities and educating people, you’re not gonna be successful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, I think, use the platforms that you have. I mean if you’re someone with — like a professional athlete with an incredible platform, it is that much more powerful to take that problem. This week, Laverne Cox took her moment at the Grammys to talk about our client, and that was the single most effective piece of public education for our case that we had. And it took her less than 60 seconds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Laverne Cox:\u003c/strong> Everyone, please Google Gavin Grimm. He’s going to the Supreme Court in March. #StandWithGavin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> It was transformative. It could change the outcome of something. And so, I think, obviously, if you have a huge platform and you have a huge, I think, amount of responsibility and power. If you have a small platform, then you have — you still have a responsibility to engage and to try to work to sort of upset these power structures. Then I think just quickly going back to the professional athletes, I do think what is important to note is that in this country, which is really founded on anti-blackness in almost every way, we consume black athletes in a particular way, and when they speak out, white people in particular are like, “Well, you’re not playing your role, because we’re okay with you as long as we can control your body in a particular way.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, I think when you have athletes sort of standing up to that, what you’re seeing in the people who are criticizing them is their discomfort with the order that we’ve set up, which is precisely to set up to oppress and dehumanize black people and many other groups, anti-blackness, I think, being one of the most — the most important thing to really centralize and think about. But all of the work that we have to do is about upsetting those power structures and recognizing that the people who criticize us when we’re doing that are just the people who need those power structures because they’re benefiting from them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Perfectly said. I mean that was right on. And you get it a lot as a professional athlete. You’ll hear guys say it all the time, where they’re telling you to stick to sports, whatever your respective sport is, and that’s well said. I have nothing to add. That was perfect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donté Stallworth, thank you for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Chase Strangio, thank you as well for being on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Thanks so much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donté Stallworth played ten years in the NFL as a wide receiver, and Chase Strangio is a staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT and AIDS Project.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Drone Bomb Me” by Anohni]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So drone bomb me\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Blow me from the mountains and into the sea\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Blow me from the side of the mountains\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Blow my head off, explode my crystal guts\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lay my purple on the grass\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let me be the first\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m not so innocent\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let me be the one\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That is the musical artist Anohni, performing her song “Drone Bomb Me.” Coming up, we’re gonna talk about a company with close ties to the Trump administration that helped that NSA spy on the world. Stay with this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, we’re back with Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill. Well, Donald Trump is now in control of the most powerful surveillance system the world has ever known. And this whole apparatus, the architecture of spying and surveillance that’s run by the NSA, the CIA, the DIA and all of the other alphabet soup agencies for decades, that whole system has been fueled by the private sector — private spy companies, private defense contractors. And that’s been true under both Democrats and Republicans. It was true under Barack Obama. But Trump is perhaps the most militant radical free marketer — so-called free marketer — to ever control the presidency. And early on in his administration, if you remember, Donald Trump had that meeting with all of these heads of tech companies. And some of them looked like they had been dragged in there, and some of them clearly were excited to be there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I’m here to help you folks do well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, that was all arranged by Trump’s good friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor. This week, The Intercept has a major exposé on one of Peter Thiel’s companies, Palantir Technologies. And the exposé, which is written by my colleague Sam Biddle, reveals new details about how Palantir helped the NSA expand its global spying operations, and also the role of the CIA in creating Peter Thiel’s company, Palantir. The article is called, “Peter Thiel’s Palantir Helped the NSA Spy on the Whole World.” It’s author, Sam Biddle, joins me now. Sam, welcome to Intercepted. What is Palantir Technologies?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sam Biddle:\u003c/strong> It’s hard to describe because it is so open-ended by design. But what it’s intended to do is take vastly different kinds of data — so videos, emails, spreadsheets, PowerPoints — basically any kind of computerized information from all different sources. You import it into one centralized database that can then be visualized, graphed, charted in a lot of really intuitive and useful ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What kind of data?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Sure. So, there are —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And whose data?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Great question. There are two main Palantir products. One is called Palantir Gotham and Palantir Metropolis. Yes, this is a very nerdy company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is there also Palantir Batwoman and Palantir Joker?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Not yet. Not yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Although the company’s name is a Lord of the Rings reference.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Pippin:\u003c/strong> He asked me my name. I didn’t answer. He hurt me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gandalf:\u003c/strong> What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> So, Palantir Gotham is aimed at government, so law enforcement, FEMA, Homeland Security and the intelligence community, of course. So that’s a lot of geographic data. Again, GPS coordinates, photos, videos, emails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Whose emails?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Anyone’s emails. It could literally be any data source. You have to bring your own data. This isn’t software that’s used to procure data. But let’s say the FBI has subpoenaed an email provider, and they get a bulk dump of text. And then they also have phone call records, and then they also have GPS data from someone’s phone. This stuff is hard to visualize together ‘cause there’s — one’s a spreadsheet and one’s text, etc. But with Palantir, you can basically put it all in one map. I mean, sometimes literally on Google Earth, which it connects to. So it makes it relatively easy to analyze the kind of data that the CIA, or the FBI, or Homeland Security would be dealing with in the course of an investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, you’ve been going through the archive of the material provided by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, and you’ve been looking in there at the materials on Palantir. What did you find in your investigation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> It’s been known and widely reported that Palantir was partially funded by In-Q-Tel, which is the CIA’s — believe it or not, their venture capital arm. They fund startups regularly. Palantir’s one of them. But we have documents that describe and state that Palantir was actually co-developed with help from the U.S. intelligence community, from the CIA; that it wasn’t just their cash that was paying Palantir’s engineers, but actual U.S. intelligence analysts and employees working in tandem with Palantir employees.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what’s the problem with that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> I think that any time the private sector and the most capable spies on the planet are making a product in secret, the uses of which are also secret, I think that should be unsettling to most people. I mean, again, every part of this is hidden and secret, so we don’t know exactly what they built into it, or what role they had, or how much oversight they had. But it’s generally not great when our country’s police and spies are working with mass-market startups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, one of the other things that you’re revealing, and, I understand for the first time, is confirmation of the extent of Palantir’s integration with the NSA and its Five Eyes partner’s XKEYSCORE program. Which of course was one of the first massive exposés Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras did with Edward Snowden that revealed this massive collection of data, private communications, etc., not just foreign adversaries, but also American citizens. So what did you learn about Palantir’s role in that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> One of the problems with XKEYSCORE is that it’s sort of too good at vacuuming up the world’s metadata and communications records. I mean, they deal with tens of billions of individual records, which no human can comprehend, and even machines would struggle to comprehend. Palantir’s role has to been to say, okay, look: you feed the raw data from XKEYSCORE into an application we’ve created, and it will then be made relatively intelligible to your analysts. So, the problem of having too much spy data, too much private collection, we can fix or at least mitigate. I like to sort of think of it as the difference between, in olden times, when you would have your Hotmail or Yahoo email inbox with just everything listed in chronological order with no real organization. The big deal about Gmail was they put it in these convenient threads, and they made it really easy to search. And it was the same data, but presented in a very — a highly useful, intuitive way. So that’s sort of what Palantir’s provided the NSA and its partner spy agencies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let’s say that these agencies actually are following the laws and not lying under oath to the Senate. Is there a problem with the capabilities that Palantir is providing to intelligence agencies?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> If an agency is in a position where it has literally so much data that it can’t even make sense of how much data it has, it’s probably collecting too much data, right? It’s at odds with the idea of, look, we carefully target our surveillance tools. We only go after bad guys. It’s hard to reconcile that claim with the fact of we have tens of billions of records. There aren’t tens of billions of terrorists. There’s only so many bad people — bad people, however you want to qualify that — in the world, right? So, they clearly have an overabundance problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Palantir is stepping in saying look, more or less, we can fix that problem. It’s cool that you’re collecting a shitload of Skype, Facebook message, Twitter, whatever, every possible form of electronic communication. We’re gonna help you with that problem, which is to make all that useful. Previously, you were encumbered by the fact that you had too much to use. Now you can use it all. Which again, sure, that’s a position they could take. But it’s hard to take that position and then also say, we believe very strongly in the protection of civil liberties and personal privacy. Those are mutually exclusive positions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Does Palantir, and do Palantir contractors, employees, etc. — are they retaining this data that they’re processing and breaking down for these intelligence agencies?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> All we know is — and we were actually able to look at some Palantir source code, which contains an end user license agreement, more or less, so, the terms of use. Here’s what you have to agree to if you want to use this software. And it says, “This Palantir software is not to be used for any activity that could possibly violate anyone’s privacy or rights of any kind.” And this was literally software that was handed over to GCHQ, the U.K.’s equivalent of the NSA, for use with XKEYSCORE, the NSA’s massive collection tool. So it’s clear that they don’t give a shit about their own legal standards or contractual obligations for their clients, so that is worrying.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I think — and this is something that you’ve, of course, reported on a lot about, is the use of contractors in the military, the overlap of the private sector and soldiers, and everything that can go wrong with that. Palantir routinely uses what they call forward-deployed engineers or FDEs, where they will send their employees, their engineers, to client’s offices, and they will just work out of their offices so that the client has in-house representatives from the company working alongside them. And we have documents showing that Palantir employees were available to help train GCHQ spies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So they’re like — so Peter Thiel is like, “Here’s our forward-deployed engineer, Bilbo Baggins.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Right. [Laughs] Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And he is going to walk you through on how to use our incredibly invasive tool.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Right. Right. So, look. Even if Palantir is not collecting or storing this intel data, they’re — at the very least, they’re helping the collection of it, right? And providing hands-on training for the people who are doing the spying. So, you have to ask yourself, should software engineers from Palo Alto be working alongside the most powerful and capable spies in the world?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And one of my big picture concern about the sort of collect-it-all mentality is that when they’re vacuuming up everything, and they’re saying, “Oh, but we’re not gonna access that, we’re not gonna look at that.” But they do repeatedly. They use it for parallel construction. Our entire lives now, our medical records, our emails, our texts, our deepest secrets are being held, not only on the servers of the companies that provide us with these tools, but also in the hands of multiple intelligence agencies. And most people in their life are not gonna end up in the crosshairs of the NSA, or the CIA, or Chinese intelligence or the Kremlin. But if you do, it’s essentially a time machine to go back and do a very invasive proctological exam, basically, of your entire life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Right. And one thing that you could normally take solace in is, look, I’m a needle in a global haystack. Even if they try to define me, it would be hard, ‘cause I’m buried alongside everyone else. But that’s exactly what Palantir is trying to correct, is say, “Look, there aren’t—there’s no more haystack. It’s all needles.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Sam. We’re gonna leave it there. Thanks for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> My pleasure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sam Biddle is a reporter for The Intercept.

But according to a document provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the NSA isn’t just concerned about what may or may not be said on the phone by Americans in sensitive positions talking to Russians. At least one NSA operative is also concerned that U.S. spies going out for an innocent dinner may prove to be an OPSEC — or operational security — nightmare.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Wallace Shawn:\u003c/strong> April 7, 2004. Highest possible classification is top secret. OPSEC. Why should you care? From, redacted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Most of us have taken the mandatory OPSEC training for this year, and many people are wondering, why should I care, or what does this have to do with me? If you think OPSEC doesn’t apply to you, consider the following scenario.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Restaurant ambiance]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Waiter:\u003c/strong> All right, if I could just have you follow me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WS:\u003c/strong> You’re at a luncheon at a local restaurant to bid farewell to Sue, a coworker who is moving on to a new office. There are 15 people there, all agency employees from your immediate team, plus Sue’s spouse, an agency employee who works in another area.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Clapping]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Your boss gets up and starts talking about the great contributions Sue has made to your efforts against international crime, and the wonderful working relationship she’s had with our sister agencies inside the Beltway.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Boss:\u003c/strong> Such a valuable member of our team.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WS:\u003c/strong> He goes on to mention that she’ll make a great branch chief. And the people working Russia are lucky to get her.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Boss:\u003c/strong> We’re all gonna miss you greatly, especially —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WS:\u003c/strong> Sue gets up to thank specific individuals present who have helped her succeed. Sound familiar? Then you’ve witnessed or perhaps participated in a demonstration of poor OPSEC. But who cares? Did anybody do any harm here? After all, we know what is classified, and we would never divulge that in public, right? But have you ever stopped to consider what your unclassified public discussions might be giving away? Take this scenario, for instance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is a scene that’s played out monthly in the Fort Meade area. It’s entirely possible that nothing said during the speeches was classified, and everyone who attended works here. So what’s the big deal? To understand the answer, you need to think like the adversary. That’s really what OPSEC is all about. What information do our adversaries care about, and what are we giving away every day? Let’s look at the scenario from an adversary perspective.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Pretend you’re the bad guy sitting at the next table in the restaurant where the luncheon is being held. What did you learn? Take a minute to think about what information you believe was shared, and then compare that to the list below.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One, the names and faces of team members picked up either because of introductions to Sue’s husband, or just in casual conversation. Two, the fact that this team works on international crime issues. This shows not only that the NSA is interested in this issue; it also shows the adversary who specifically knows about this target. Three, the most senior people on the team have been identified, specifically the boss, who praised Sue’s efforts. It’s also highly likely that the general hierarchy of the team can be determined just by watching social interaction. Four, the links between NSA and other agencies working crime issues. Five, the skills necessary to work both the international crime and Russian targets, and any parallels between them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are potentially many more correlations that can be drawn from this scenario, but I think you get the point. So what can we do to reduce this risk? There are some simple adjustments we can make that can help a great deal. No, I’m not going to suggest discontinuing luncheons. But requesting a private room or for tables to be set up away from other customers for privacy purposes is a relatively easy way to make it much more difficult for an adversary to gather information unobtrusively\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I hope that this has shown you that OPSEC does in fact apply to everyone. The SID OPSEC program managers are ready to assist you in determining how OPSEC relates to your particular mission area and day-to-day work activities.

And by the way, Wally has a great play that’s currently being performed in New York City. It’s called “Evening at the Talk House.” If you’re in town, check it out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In Donald Trump’s constant denunciation of the news media, he almost never forgets to mention what he calls the “failing New York Times.” Now, I’ve had my own views on that paper’s failings over the years, including some of its coverage of the lead-up to the Iraq War that helped push the false narrative that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But that paper also employs a number of really good journalists, including one of the best journalists reporting on the realities of the post-9/11 era. And I’m talking about investigative reporter James Risen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He was the first reporter to expose warrantless wiretapping. No, not Edward Snowden revelations, warrantless wiretapping. Wiretapping as it was happening in the Bush and Cheney administration. And James Risen had to fight his own editors to publish that story. Risen has broken numerous stories on private war contractors, torture, the CIA, and special operations forces. And for seven years, he fought a battle against the Justice Department, the Obama Justice Department, which tried to force him to give up his sources. James Risen never budged, even under the threat of imprisonment. Well, eventually, the Justice Department dropped its pursuit of Risen, but the precedent set in that case is gonna have far-reaching implications, particularly in light of Trump’s posturing about leakers and journalism in general. Jim, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>James Risen:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, I think a lot of people are making a mistake by just covering Trump as though he’s this buffoon, and oh my god, what’s the next thing he’s going to say? Because I do think there are not just whiffs, but kind of a growing stench of authoritarian, almost fascistic policies that seem to be being implemented via Twitter, the public statements, these executive orders. So, I mean, I see something quite demonic in the attack on the news media because I don’t think it’s really just an attack on news organizations or journalism. It is — it’s an attempt to sort of say, “Nothing is true unless it comes from the Dear Leader.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Right. Right. That’s the scary part of it. And I think there — he seems to have a base of support for that in the United States. And I think that’s one of the relatively uncovered aspects of the campaign was the degree to which people were voting for an authoritarian candidate consciously. I don’t think that’s just a side plot. I think there was a significant portion of the American people who want authoritarianism. And I think Trump is — he’s definitely got a strong strain of authoritarianism. And I think one of his — one of the problems we have is that the Republican Party refuses to recognize that. And so, you’ve got all these relatively normal Republicans trying to reign in Trump in various ways without acknowledging what he really is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And it’s like journalist Allan Nairn said recently, that he kicked the oligarchs and the neocons and the traditional Republicans, he dragged them unwillingly into power in this election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> The problem is, you don’t really know from day to day what Trump is or is going to do. I mean, I think you’re right. He’s authoritarian. At the other side, he’s kind of completely unhinged on certain things. And so, you never know quite where he’s going. In some ways, that’s comforting. You know, I was talking to a friend of mine who used to be in the government who was saying — he worked overseas, and he was saying, “You know, I’ve seen author — I’ve seen dictators up close. And the one thing about dictators who are successful is that they are disciplined.” And he said, “The one thing that gives me comfort about Trump is that he seems completely undisciplined,” which is small comfort, actually.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] What — you, you wrote this very provocative — well, I actually didn’t find it provocative ‘cause I follow your work, and I know what happened to you under both the Bush and Obama administrations. But the title of it was, “If Donald Trump Targets Journalists, Thank Obama.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> The Obama administration was by far the most anti-press administration we’ve had since at least Nixon. They — as you know, they conducted more leak investigations and did more leak prosecutions — more than all the previous administrations combined. And they targeted journalists in ways that no other administration ever has. And they went — you know, in my case, they went after me for seven years. They had a grand jury trying to get me to — they subpoenaed me, and then during a trial they tried to subpoena me to testify and to reveal my sources. When the trial judge in my case quashed subpoenas against me, the Justice Department under Obama appealed that to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. And the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court’s decision and ordered that I testify, and in that order, agreed with the Obama administration’s position in the case, which was, there is no such thing as a reporter’s privilege in a criminal case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We appealed that to the Supreme Court because it’s such a devastating blow to press freedom in the United States. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused to take the case. And so, as a result, the biggest legacy of the Obama administration on press freedom right now is the 4th Circuit decision, which states that there is no such thing as a reporter’s privilege in the 4th Circuit. And the 4th Circuit covers Virginia and Maryland, which are home to the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, virtually — what that means is, legally, if there is a leak investigation involving the CIA, the Pentagon, the NSA or any of the major security agencies in the United States, which is where most leak investigations occur, there will be no legal protections for any reporter because of the ruling in my case, which I think was an outrageous decision by the Obama administration to file a brief. They said flat-out, there is no such thing as a reporter’s privilege in a criminal case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So what does that mean, then, for — Trump, of course, celebrated the publication of the DNC emails and, and John Podesta’s emails, and was constantly tweeting in praise of WikiLeaks. And then that caused this chain reaction where people like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter became, you know, major backers of Julian Assange. And now, Trump is essentially saying, “I’m gonna go to war against the people leaking information about my administration, and from within the intelligence community.” So what are the consequences of your case and the Obama legacy on press freedom now, in this moment we’re in with Trump saying basically, “I’m gonna go after all leakers?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it makes — what Obama did makes it much easier for Trump to do what he wants on leaks. They have created an environment and have left it for Trump that makes it very easy to subpoena a reporter and then force him to testify. And the alternative — the only alternative right now is for a reporter to go to jail to protect their sources.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Look, the hypocrisy on leaks is a long tradition in Washington. Most leaks, as you know, come from official sources. You know, I would say 80 to 90 percent of leaks that you read about in the press every day are something that the government itself wants out. It’s the 10 to 20 percent of leaks that are inconvenient for the powers that be that always get the powers, whoever’s president or whoever, they get upset about. And so, it all depends on whose ox is getting gored by the leaks. And that’s always been true. When the Democrats are in power, they hate leaks; when the Republicans are in power, they hate leaks. I think Trump has just taken that language to new heights.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you think there really is a conflict between Trump and the intelligence agencies? Do you think that the NSA or the CIA are, indeed, withholding information from Trump because of concern about his erratic behavior and potential for him to be blackmailed or compromised?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Well, I know there’s been some reporting on that. I find it a little bit hard to believe because of what my — what I know about the way those agencies work. I think that there is a — they tend to be filled by people who are — who want to be part of a large organization. They’re not filled by rebels. It’s — these are people who tend to be conservative culturally, and maybe not politically so much, but they are — they’re not the kind of, you know — there’s not very many whistleblowers in the intelligence community. You know, Edward Snowden is a — is an outlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What about the clearly very influential role that Steve Bannon, the former head of the Breitbart empire, and Stephen Miller are playing, particularly when it comes to national security issues and the National Security Council?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> You know, you’ve got these, these various centers of gravity that appear to be forming in the Trump circle, you know? You’ve got the adults, or the seeming adults, like Mattis or Trump — or Pence, I mean. You know, and then McCain playing this role from the outside, kind of this hazy role. And then you’ve got kind of the insurgents within the Trump circle, Bannon and Jared Kushner. It seems to me, from what little I know, that Kushner is kind of the key bridge between the more moderate forces and the insurgents. And he seems to have the ear of the president. And I wonder whether all of this won’t boil down to a fight for control over Jared Kushner’s brain, you know, where both sides realize that they have to get control of the flow of information between him and Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think that, that may be where — how this pans out, is Trump seems to have —most of his trust lies with his family. And so, it’s kind of like an old European court, where you have to decide, okay, which relative do I need to impress and — to get to the king? Maybe that’s what the fight will be about, controlling the flow, the access to and the flow of information between Kushner and Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did your ordeal with — under the Bush and Obama administrations, and the — sort of the war against you, and I think at times, it seemed like they were trying to punish you for the reporting that you had done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Yeah. [Laughs] I think they were. You know, I think, frankly, I’ve always thought that the reason they came after me on — the story they came after me was on my CIA in Iran story that was in “State of War.” I think it was because of the NSA stories we did for the New York Times, which they — I think they made a calculated decision. We’re not gonna go after the New York Times, but we can isolate Risen and go after him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The whole way in which leak investigations is done and has been done is arbitrary, and makes no legal — there’s no real legal rationale you can make, other than, you know, the use of political power. The — you know, the Obama and Bush administrations just did it a little more subtly than Trump seems to be starting to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did the battle that you were forced to fight by this targeting of you and some of your alleged sources, has it changed the way you report or the way that you deal with sources?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Yeah. It made it difficult to talk to some people. Some people didn’t want to talk to me ‘cause it made ‘em nervous. Other people, I think the fact that I was fighting and refusing to cooperate made other people want to talk to me. So it was kind of a mixed bag. But it was exhausting, and it kind of made me very wary about, you know — about the way I operated. I try to, you know — everyone talks about encryption today and how, you know, reporters have to use encryption. I think — I think that personal meeting, face-to-face meeting, is still the best.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I agree. I mean, I really do think that, you know, that the reality is that journalists now are being forced to act like spies, and of course, we’re not spies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Right. Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And it’s not just for our — the integrity of our own reporting process. It’s because of the humongous stakes for somebody slapped with an espionage charge.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> You kind of feel like you’re living in a police state. You know, that’s not the way you should have to work as a reporter in a democracy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. I mean, it’s like, let’s meet Deep Throat in the car garage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Deep Throat:\u003c/strong> It involves the entire U.S. intelligence community — FBI, CIA, and Justice. It’s incredible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it is almost like you have to become a Luddite with, you know, counterespionage or counter-surveillance skills just to do your job as a reporter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> You know, I’ve got a lot of funny stories about the way I’ve had to meet sources. I had one source who demanded that we meet in sauna —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Where we were both naked, so — because he wanted to make sure he wasn’t being recorded, and that there were no listening devices. And so, we met in like a — it was like a bath, a Russian bath type place. And that was probably the weirdest I’ve had to do. And I couldn’t take out my notebook in there ‘cause it was all steamy, so I just had to remember the best I could what he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jim, I will never be able to erase what you’ve just told me from my mind.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Yeah, it’s kind of too much information, probably.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Although, that could have been an interesting author photo for your book.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why — what gets you up in the morning and keeps you going as a reporter, given that you’re — as you said, there are elements of feeling like you, you’re in a police state just doing your job. What keeps you going?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> [Sighs] Good question. Actually, I have to say — I have to admit that Trump’s election made me question — made me question whether people really want to hear about the abuses of the government that, you know, you and I and other people have been reporting on, particularly since 9/11. Because the American people just voted to basically double down on those things. And so, I’ve had to rethink, you know, what is it that I’m trying to do? And I guess the answer is, we just, you know, have to keep trying to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jim, thanks.

As Trump continues to promote his alternative facts, Nada Bakos and Clint Watts explain how Trump’s administration could use Dick Cheney’s model of “alternative intelligence” to justify dangerous military actions. Immigrant communities across the U.S. are facing a dramatic uptick in raids as part of Trump’s pledge to deport millions while Attorney General Jeff Sessions cancels the Obama-era order to end the use of private prisons. Shane Bauer of Mother Jones worked as a private prison guard and breaks down the connections between the raids and soaring private prison profits. Intercept reporter Ryan Devereaux discusses his investigations into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House plans for mass deportations. Trump’s insane adviser, Sebastian Gorka, hangs out with Alice in Wonderland. And an Intercepted exclusive: the world premiere of the new song &#8220;Fake News&#8221; by the acclaimed Iraqi-Canadian hip-hop artist, Narcy. We bet you never thought you’d hear Steve Bannon’s name rapped in auto-tune.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alice in Wonderland:\u003c/strong> If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.

Trump:\u003c/strong> Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands, and we will use it to light up the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JS: Well, seeing Donald Trump address a joint session of the United States Congress felt like an awkward yet very disturbing class trip to the Capitol where every kid gets to pretend they’re a senator or a congressman or the president, and they take a picture on the house floor that they can show their parents or their grandparents. Except the kid at the podium? Yeah, he’s the president of the most powerful nation on earth. We certainly are on a trip, a very bad trip, and one that’s already having grave consequences, both in the U.S. and across the globe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Whoever wrote Trump’s speech at the Capitol may be trying to roll out a softer, more responsible Trump operating system, the soft-serve Trump, but this is all Kabuki theater. And I’m gonna leave that to the pundits, the politicians, the news shows to deal with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Donald Trump likes to portray himself as the great promoter and defender of America, its strongest supporter of law enforcement and the U.S. military. He’s promising a massive — some in his circles say unprecedented — expansion in the U.S. military budget, while at the same time gutting social spending. Trump loves to talk about his generals. But listen to how Trump talks about the death of William “Ryan” Owens, an elite U.S. Navy SEAL who died in the utterly disastrous raid that Trump authorized while having dinner with his son-in-law and Steve Bannon last month in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Well, this was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something that was, you know, just — they wanted to do. And they came to see me. They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. My generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I would — I believe. And they lost Ryan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is so fucked up on so many levels. First of all, upwards of 30 Yemeni civilians, including many women and an infant, were killed in this raid. Success? The U.S. military doesn’t dispute that a large number of civilians were killed. Yet Trump keeps calling it this huge success. But second, did you hear how Trump blamed the U.S. Navy SEAL’s death on the generals? It’s amazing. Trump wants to be commander-in-chief when it’s convenient for his reality show White House, or on the campaign trail. But when an elite soldier dies — “oh, well, the generals lost him.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he’s very happy because I think he just broke a record. [Laughing] [Applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, for his part, the father of that Navy SEAL, Bill Owens, refused to meet with Trump. He said, “Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn’t even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen. Everything was missiles and drones because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden, we had to make this grand display?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Trump maintains that the raid was a success. And White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says they’re gonna conduct three separate military reviews.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This Yemen horror show raises, what I think is, one of the most urgent questions that we as journalists need to be asking constantly. How will we ever know if anything this White House or this president himself says is true? They lie. They lie constantly. They lie about little things. They lie about big things. They’re addicted to the narcotic of lying, and it’s infectious among their supporters. It’s one thing to call CNN fake news and to chastise the New York Times. That’s all extremely disturbing, of course. But what is to stop Trump and his team from expanding their universe of alternative facts into a world of alternative intelligence? This week, George W. Bush won praise from liberals and conservatives alike for his mild criticisms of Trump and his totally hypocritical defense of the news media’s role in our democracy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George W. Bush:\u003c/strong> I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy; that we need an independent media to hold people like me to account. I mean, power can be very addictive, and it can be corrosive. And it’s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m not gonna join in the chorus of praise for George W. Bush just because he tosses some cotton balls of criticism at Trump. This man was responsible for the deaths of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people across the globe, and thousands of American troops. He served as the head of what was basically a criminal syndicate of war criminals and torture, while masquerading as a compassionate conservative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There’s good reason, though, to bring up George W. Bush in the context of Trump. Bush’s wars relied on what we now call alternative facts. That’s how the Iraq War was sold. That was how the Patriot Act was passed. That was how these endless wars were justified over and over and over. Bush and Dick Cheney, yeah, they were a bit more sophisticated than Trump and Bannon and their team appear to be. But we can already see that same machinery that brought us the Iraq War playing out with Trump and his team. It’s one thing to lie in all caps on Twitter. It’s another to manipulate intelligence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m joined now by two people who know a lot about this. They both worked on sensitive operations within the U.S. intelligence community under George W. Bush’s administration. Clint Watts was a U.S. Army infantry officer who was then recruited after 9/11 to become an FBI Special Agent on the Joint Terrorism Taskforce. Watts also served as the executive director of the Combatting Terrorism Center at West Point. Nada Bakos was a career CIA analyst. She found herself actually working on the program to find a connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. And she was working on that as a result of pressure from the Bush White House, particularly Dick Cheney, on the CIA. That connection, of course, was never substantiated. I want to welcome both you, Clint Watts, and you, Nada Bakos, to Intercepted. Clint Watts, let’s begin with you. What’s your read on Trump’s approach to the CIA, the military, and intelligence operations in general?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Clint Watts:\u003c/strong> The Trump strategy is to build allegiance by fawning on law enforcement and the military the way he’s done so far to try and bring them in so that they are loyal and adherent to him in ways that the Obama administration failed. And then at the same point, to drive a wedge between the intelligence community and much of the military and law enforcement, which was very typical of General Flynn — you know, the first national security adviser. He butted heads straight on with the CIA and even other parts of the Defense Department, parts of the law enforcement community. So I think the initial strategy was to defang the intel community, then sort of say, “Okay, I’ll listen to you, and I’ll come to you a little bit,” and then to continue to drive that wedge and then pump up the military and law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it’s backfired, I think, to a certain degree. And I think at a higher level, what the public doesn’t see is there are competing strains inside each of these organizations. So, in the Department of Defense, there are those that are very excited about a Trump administration ‘cause they feel they’ve been, you know, a little bit under-handed by the Obama administration. I think within the intel community, it’s much more balanced, and they’re not as enthusiastic about it because the president doesn’t accept information that’s against his views. Literally, his presidential daily brief, he doesn’t take. He doesn’t take the intel briefings. He only wants the intelligence that fits a certain filter. For anyone that’s a bona fide intelligence expert, that’s the worst thing that you ever want to hear. It’s also an opportunity, though.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think the smarter people in the intelligence community are gonna treat him like a dictator. And what do you do with a dictator? You play to his ego. So they will end up almost influencing the president like a foreign adversary, I think, that if they want to convince him of what they believe the truth or a balanced assessment for America is, they’re gonna end up treating him like a Gaddafi or a Putin, or somebody that they want to appeal to. And they’re literally gonna have to make their assessments with the information behind it come to terms with the president’s worldview, which is very frightening because it really sets up a lot of blind spots as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There’s a lot of discussion now in the media of, you know, what’s called the Deep State, and also this notion that the CIA and certain sectors of the FBI are trying to undermine the legitimacy of Donald Trump’s presidency; then on the other side, saying that the CIA and other agencies may not actually be providing President Trump with the full picture on an intelligence level because they don’t trust him. What do you say to that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> I think what will be the tell about this division inside these organizations is when you see words of alternative intelligence process or alternative analysis process, which I imagine will happen. If you remember back during —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what does that mean?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> If you remember back during the Bush administration when it was time to build the case for war in Iraq, there was certain segments in the Department of Defense that were coming up with their own independent assessments of the justifications to go to war in Iraq. And those oftentimes competed and were contrarian to what you got out of the intelligence community. So, if this administration really wants to push a certain agenda — and we’ve already seen this now with the DHS’s intel assessment around the ban in these countries. They produced a report that didn’t match up with this policy that they’re pushing, so now you see the administration say, well, I’m not gonna listen to it. We’re still gonna push it forward. Maybe we need to go back to the drawing board and do analysis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What I would expect them to do is start to put together alternative teams out of the White House that are going to provide another competitive look at these questions. And if we see that, especially in the Department of Defense, or run directly out of the National Security Council, I would have great concern. That to me would signal, I don’t trust my intel agencies, and the intel I want to support my actions is the following. Go find it. And that happened, if you remember, back during the Bush administration, where there was this alternative intelligence process which was coming out sideways against the intel community. So that’s very nerve-wracking to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and just to provide people the historical context for that, you had Stephen Cambone, who was one of Rumsfeld’s top deputies, who ran what they call the Office of Special Plans. And Cambone and other minions or representatives of Rumsfeld were doing what’s called stovepiping. They were taking raw bits of intelligence and cherry-picking them to support a conclusion, rather than letting the facts lead to a conclusion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Nada, you served during this time at the CIA, where you had this parallel operation being run out of the Pentagon while the CIA was tasked with determining, are these things true? Are they not? What does the evidence look like? And then you had Cambone and others running around cherry-picking intelligence and providing it directly to the vice president. Could we see something like that replay under Trump, Nada?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nada Bakos:\u003c/strong> So, under the Office of Special Plans, as you mentioned, Doug Feith was involved, Paul Wolfowitz was involved. Their findings were the opposite of basically what we were finding at the time. I was on the team charged with figuring out whether or not Iraq had anything to do with 9/11 and al Qaeda. Now, that question did not come up organically through the intelligence we were collected [sic]. That question came up from the administration. We weren’t seeing indicators. We wouldn’t have formed a team otherwise to evaluate this information. So, that in and of itself, was the beginning of a backwards, you know, cart before the horse. We came to our conclusion. We delivered it to the White House, to Congress. The DOD did have a very different opinion on how they characterized relationships between Saddam and other terrorist organizations. They weighed false information. They also took raw reports and cherry-picked those from sources that we didn’t deem reliable, and gave those to the president. It’s very clear that politicizing intelligence and cherry-picking information that you think is gonna support your bottom line, you know — it led to war, in this instance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Colin Powell:\u003c/strong> One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq’s biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents. Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Because the two of you have a lot more experience than I do in the world of intelligence, I want to throw at you something that is, to me, the biggest lingering question about the Russian affair, so to speak. The question I have for you guys is this: given that we know that the same cell or the same actors that were using the same Bitly link and the same tools, and all the forensics indicates this, we’re going after opponents of Vladimir Putin outside of the United States, within Russia, journalists, NGOs, in Ukraine, in other countries around the world. But in the United States, it wasn’t — and this is the point I’m getting at — it wasn’t this surgical strike on the DNC’s emails. It wasn’t a surgical strike on John Podesta’s Gmail account. These hackers were targeting swaths of people that were influencers in the United States that were connected to the military or connected to intelligence. And so, to me, the idea that you say, well, the intent of the hack was to influence the election, I don’t believe we’ve seen evidence to back that up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> I think there’s four scenarios, and you can rule out a couple really quick. On the Trump side, what he would tell you is he’s just a guy who likes Russian issues and believes very similar to them. On the other end is the Manchurian candidate. He’s picked, selected and is doing the bidding of Putin. I don’t think the links are there to come to that conclusion. In the middle, though, you’ve got two scenarios. One, the useful idiot scenario: he’s a guy that the Russians saw picking an agenda that waffles back and forth, and is not — as we’ve seen now — very much on top of national security issues, so you can just run with him. And so you just promote him, you know, and you tear down other opponents to him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then there’s the compromise scenario. Is he really just compromised, and he doesn’t have much choice? I think that there’s only two things that can really flush that out as we move forward. And if an investigation moves forward, there’s a special prosecutor. But they ultimately have to term it is, in the useful idiot scenario, he’s gonna be surrounded by a bunch of advisers that are comprised, influenced, paid for by the Russian governor. And we already are seeing some signals of that. Trump is notorious for bringing people on as allies and business or in government that he doesn’t really know very well, and jettisoning them just as quickly. So I think it’s highly probable that Russia could influence these key political figures around him to come help mold his mind, push him towards Russian positions, whether he knows them or not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other scenario is compromise. Are the claims of St. Petersburg and financial compromise — are they there? That takes a deep investigation, and we know less about this president’s tactics and businesses than any president in the history of mankind. If I had to guess right now, I think it’s the useful idiot surrounded by Russian influence agents. You know, there’s three or four people that it appears who are being investigated or looked at. They had sway with the president at different times. You know, Trump walked up and cited Sputnik News, fake story about a Podesta email in Benghazi and dropped it on the ground.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> “If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate.” In other words, he’s now admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi. This just came out a little while ago. [Crowd shouting]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> Who gave that to him? Well, it had to be somebody that was tightly woven into the influence system of Russia. Now, is that Trump doing that himself? Well, you can’t say that because we’ve seen how many conspiracies he falls for on Twitter, so he could equally fall for the influence of a nation state who just strategically puts a few people around him for a few 100,000 dollars. I mean it could be a very cheap effort. So, I don’t think it’s this Manchurian candidate. And in fact, I think what’ll disprove the Manchurian candidate scenario is as soon as Trump and this administration, which now has McMaster, Mattis, Kelly — a lot of these people in there, a huge push now from the Republican congress that’s anti-Russian. Soon as they go against Russia, whether it’s in Syria or Ukraine or one of these Eastern European countries, when you see the Russians pivot their influence operation against Trump, then you’ll know he’s not the Manchurian candidate scenario. It’s somewhere in between.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Speaking of useful idiots, I wanted to talk about Sebastian Gorka for a moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SG:\u003c/strong> A mixture of fascism, of communism, all wrapped up in the religion of Islam. And it’s these people you must read and understand if you wish to understand the threat to America, and why it truly is an existential threat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He is in the news a lot because Trump and Bannon have put him there. What does it mean that he is in the position he’s in right now, and who is he?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> He started showing up at events that I was at probably around 2011, ’12, you know, if I had to put a guess on the date, and would be a panelist and always very strong, very antagonistic, oftentimes rude towards other panelists that were there. Very aggressive, and always sort of fawning over the military, law enforcement, tough talk, which was good for his business. I mean he’s primarily a trainer. You know, he’s trying to sell training, or what I call “edutainment.” You know, it’s a cross between education and entertainment, and it’s not good at either one, really, you know, and you’re just getting a show. And so, what you see is very typical of President Trump, which is he sees somebody that’s saying something that he likes or that makes sense, and it’s a very simple explanation. He’s seeing somebody who’s a very good presenter, and he is — Gorka is a very good showman. He’s a dynamic, engaging speaker. You can’t deny that at all. But under the surface, when you look at his claims and what they’re actually about, they’re oftentimes very hollow, no more than an inch deep. They play to the audience that is hiring him and bringing him his cash stream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SG:\u003c/strong> If you want people to read your book, especially Americans, you must have a good story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> The first time I watched him, and he repeats this every time is, “I know what they’re saying ‘cause I read the Koran in English.” He doesn’t note that part ‘cause he doesn’t know Arabic. You know, “I study it, and all you’ve got to do is read what they say and know that we’re at war with Islam.” And then he’ll sort of tailor back and say radical Islam. And then when you try and pin him down on that, it’s like it could be anything under the sun. And the strategies that he’s picking are exactly the ones for which al Qaeda attacked us with the far enemy doctrine to begin with, backing apostate dictators who don’t obey human rights and are, you know, hard on their people, and clamping down on terrorism in ways that are not beneficial to the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that’s generally the strategy of Trump. We’re gonna partner in ways like we did in the ‘90s, which ultimately brought the rise of al Qaeda. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I think what you see with Gorka — and this is not limited. This is Bannon, this is Gorka, this is that strain in the inner White House. They want this end times battle with Islam. And it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. They’ll clamp down and be hard, to be tough and look tough in the face of the adversary, which is poorly defined. And that’ll provoke terrorist attacks, and they’ll say, “See? I told you so. I told you we have to clamp down harder.” It’s a weird phenomenon that they’re running with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If you, on the one hand, have Trump going after the CIA, putting pressure on the FBI, and then putting people like Gorka, who are basically fan boys of the Special Operations community, that to me is what’s dangerous about this, because you have a disproportionate number of, kind of, Jerry Boykin acolytes within that world than you do in the broader U.S. military. And it concerns me that a guy like Gorka — it’s not that he says something about Trump’s politics. It says something about their strategy that these are the kinds of guys that they want around. The fact that you have Gorka and Bannon and Stephen Miller and these kind of radical ideologues who view Islam as the cancer on the world, and that our main mission should be to destroy it, what does that say about the broader risks that are posed by Trump’s presidency on a national security level?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s very blindsided — I mean, it’s so narrow and so hyper-focused on an issue that you might put number five under the Obama administration. I mean, Islamic extremism’s been a big deal for a while, but you could see it start to move away. China, Iran — we’re back in this nation state stuff with Russia. We’re now pivoting right back to re-fighting Iraq in 2005. You know, that sort of thinking. And it’s gonna blind us to all these other more legitimate threats. For example, I’m really excited about McMaster being in there as a national security advisor because Flynn was deeply scary to me. But if you look at even McMaster, Mattis, Kelly, a lot of these military people they’ve pushed forward, who’s in charge of the cyberattack that hits the United States and is the expert on it? It’s definitely not Gorka, Bannon, or any of these folks. They’re basically turning a blind eye to every issue except for radical Islam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They’re also doing several things. One, they’re playing up to war. They’re playing up to defense spending, which I just talked about before; and they’re playing up to the biggest and best killing machine that’s ever been created in history. What is super scary about it to me is you’re looking at people who have got a thimble of knowledge about a lot of these groups that we’re tackling right now. Al Qaeda and ISIS have never been so disaggregated and spread on so many different continents. You can’t lump them all together. You’ve got them dangerously lumping Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood, al Qaeda and ISIS all as allies right now. That is lunacy. You’re creating a big enemy so that you can then go fight it when I have to say, under the Obama administration and the end of the Bush administration after the sort of missteps, we’ve really reoriented in a much smarter way to be more nimble and focus on what is the real threat we want to worry about, which is no attacks on the homeland, going after core al Qaeda leaders, trying to stay out of a lot of these insurgency campaigns.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we are almost just across the board, the Trump and that inner circle, we’re gonna undo everything that was done before us, and we’re gonna double down on those that we want to be most like. And it’s a general insecurity. Trump, Bannon, Gorka are insecure about themselves, and the way they build their security is to try and reinforce and touch on those people that are the toughest in the business.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> Surrounding himself with people like Bannon and Gorka, he’s bought into this, and I think can only understand this binary conversation about terrorism. He doesn’t — Bannon and Gorka — Gorka, we’ll talk about him. He especially clearly does not understand radicalization process and what happens to an individual as they go through that process. And there’s many stepping off points. You can’t argue that there isn’t something tied to religion with al Qaeda and ISIS and other groups like this. But he doesn’t even understand how it’s tied in. He thinks it’s really about mainstream Islam, and the Koran and what it teaches. He’s reading this literal version of the Koran. And if you did with the Bible, you’d come out with the same sort of outlook of violence and death and [laughs] destruction. I mean, it’s not —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I was terrified as a kid every time —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> He doesn’t understand —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> — we’d read the Old Testament.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I would have nightmares for months.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dramatized Audio Bible (Deuteronomy 20):\u003c/strong> If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock, and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> And he doesn’t understand the philosophy and the education that goes into understanding — you know, interpreting these historical texts. The fact that Gorka can’t even understand that on a basic level means that he is completely the wrong person to be looking at countering terrorism and understanding the Middle East at all whatsoever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now back to your question about the DOD. It does bother me that he is just surrounding himself with one single type of viewpoint, because this isn’t — there’s a lot of tools in this toolkit that he should be using. The State Department, the intelligence community. If you’re only seeing everything — and I hate this analogy, but I’m gonna use it — as a nail and you have a hammer, that’s all you’re gonna use. A lot of these generals don’t have this interagency experience. They don’t understand how to build governance processes. They can tear stuff down, you know, and clean the path forward, but they don’t know how to rebuild because that’s just not what the military does, and that’s not what they’re charged with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I would say the same thing for what — the reliance on JSOC. I don’t understand, on one hand, how continuing to use this tool, over and over again, is a strategy. And anyone would see it that way. There are limitations to using anything continuously  — same thing with drones. What I don’t see at all is a nuance of understanding of global outlook, and in addition to how we can actually develop and enact a foreign policy that’s not based on military conditions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, on that token, it does seem as though Trump believes that Mike Pompeo is his guy, and Pompeo is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency now. That probably would be of concern to you. I mean, if they’re striking deals to get Cabinet posts that could potentially compromise them as director of an agency, such as the CIA, that could be real problematic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> It concerns me to the extent that I think, if there is undue influence by the administration, the expectation that you toe the line according to what they want versus the reality, the situation on the ground? Absolutely. Because what that does it politicizes the structure of the intelligence community. So you can politicize the information that comes out, you know, possibly develop your own team that feeds the bottom line that you’re after, but you can also do it through the structure. That to me is one of the more concerning underlying factors in how he’s treating the intelligence community, because if it’s always serving his needs and serving his view of the world, he may as well not have one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, you know, what about the balloon that the administration floated about bringing back or reconstituting the CIA black sites and rolling back the clock on some of the authorizations for what, I think, can clearly be called torture techniques to be used on prisoners? And the fact that the deputy CIA director herself was reportedly involved with setting up these CIA black sites? I know they’re saying now that they’re not gonna do that, but this administration is quite unpredictable and contradicts itself hourly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] So, I cannot imagine they’re gonna find a CIA officer willing to stick their neck out and do anything with that type — reconstituting that program. Look at Sabrina De Sousa. She’s currently being detained in Portugal based on what had happened in a rendition in Italy. Is the Trump administration running to her defense? No. So, this is — clearly the message is, if you’re caught and you’re involved, too bad. The United States government isn’t gonna worry about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, or —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> I can’t imagine a CIA officer taking that risk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, or you write a book, like Jose Rodriguez, where you brag about it, or you’re the contractors who help to set this up. I mean, it’s not — I’m sure you’re right about actual CIA officers. But, I don’t know about contractors and certain people like Jose Rodriguez, who has profited off of bragging about how he had to put on the big-boy pants and teach everybody how to torture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> I’m sure you could find a contractor who would set this up at this point for an X amount of money, because evidently, they’re increasing the military budget. But again, I think you’d have a really hard time finding people within the building of the CIA willing to be heavily involved in this and take any type of — any kind of responsibility. You would probably have to turn it on — off to outsiders to make it function.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we wrap up, Clint, what’s your biggest concern for the next four years, if in fact Trump decides he wants to stay president, or if he manages to keep his presidency alive for that time? What’s your biggest concerns?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> There is a war right now between that inner circle, the Bannon, Gorka, Walid Phares, former General Flynn, NSA and these other agencies. And so, to their credit, they’ll say, “Look, we gotta come in and shake things up, and we’re breaking down the old roles, and we’re gonna do things different.” And that sounds great. And if they could cut the bureaucracy in government, that would be wonderful. But as we just saw, they just increased defense spending, which is increasing bureaucracy. And I think my biggest concern is — in the next six months, in this war between, I call it the pragmatists and the ideologues, the pragmatist being more like a General Mattis, that we’re reliant on a guy who goes by chaos to be the one to bring the peace  — is can they set the course of the administration so it’s not dangerous and counterproductive, in a way, before the ideologues take over?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the one — my biggest fear is that there’s a major terrorist attack between now and that current takes over, because it will bring the country under the umbrella of the president to be tough and have to prove yourself, and the ideologues will run first because they’re more organized. If you look at these dumb executive orders they pushed, they did it before the appointees were even in office or even aware of it, which is dumb. But it shows how zealous they are. And that’s why I’m scared about — if I were al Qaeda or ISIS, I would attack now. If I was a nation state, Russia, China, Iran, I would provoke us right now because you’ll get that overreaction that they want.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Nada Bakos, your biggest concerns in the coming years?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> Incompetency. I mean you look at the White House and how it’s structured. They’re copying and pasting from the George W. Bush administration on the structure of the National Security Council, and then they realize that they did it wrong, and that the Joint Chiefs of Staff was actually on there under Obama, and this is unacceptable. They are at the top level of government. And I am concerned that just the incompetency coupled with the ideologue attitude, we are going to see just enormous decisions being made that are at the expense of the people of the United States. I also am very concerned about, as Clint mentioned, ideologues running this country. I spent 10 years of my life at the CIA evaluating and writing intelligence reports on ideologues of all spectrums. And that’s really the last thing that I want to see at the helm of the United States government at this point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, well, Nada Bakos, thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NB:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Clint Watts, thank you —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> — very much for your time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Nada Bakos was a career CIA analyst who also served as the chief targeter in the hunt for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi during the Iraq War. And Clint Watts is a former FBI special agent on the Joint Terrorism Taskforce.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After the break, we’ll talk about private prisons. And we have the world premiere of a new song by the hip-hop artist Narcy. I only have three words: Steve Bannon auto-tune. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff Immelt:\u003c/strong> Mr. President, good to see you again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Hi, Jeff.

Gunga gunga lagunga.” And he’s gonna stiff me. And I say, “Hey!

And Donald Trump has accomplished a tremendous amount of golfing in his first month in office. Just tremendous. As he sets out to break Kim Jong-un’s legendary golf accomplishments, Trump has hundreds, literally hundreds of vacancies in positions that still need a Senate confirmation. Trump seems to be spending an incredible amount of time watching television and then tweeting things that he hears on television, without checking if they’re true or not. But not all of this is something to laugh at, because what Trump has officially done as president, it’s real. It’s serious.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As we record this Tuesday night, there are reports that Donald Trump may be reconsidering some of his hardline positions on undocumented immigrants. This was one of the linchpins or his campaign for the presidency. Build the wall, mass deportations, round them all up. Here are the facts so far. Donald Trump and his administration have set a tone in this country that is clearly aimed at dehumanizing certain types of immigrants or visitors to the United States. We’ve seen that with the Muslim ban. And to listen to Trump, you would imagine that there are just swarms of Mexicans and Central Americans descending on America with a singular mission to commit crimes against white people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We will begin removing the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the country — drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers — and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> While Trump and his administration and their high profile supporters conduct this very public fear campaign, on a policy level, they’re building up the infrastructure for mass deportation operations, and a further paramilitarization of the Department of Homeland Security, of the U.S. Border Patrol, and of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security released a pair of memos that officially began the process of implementing Trump’s ultra hardline domestic immigration enforcement vision. These DHS memos radically expand the range of people who can be swiftly deported without any meaningful due process. My colleague here at The Intercept, Ryan Devereaux, has been reporting on the Trump administration’s executive orders, on his immigration policies, on his Department of Homeland Security and immigration visions. He has sources that have been blowing the whistle from within the government. And his reporting on this has been essential.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ryan, thanks for being with us. Lay out what your reporting has found about what the Trump administration is doing here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ryan Devereaux:\u003c/strong> Essentially, what the administration has done is radically expanded the category of people who can be targeted for deportation. And it’s important to remember that in this country, we have all kinds of families with mixed status: a dad who’s undocumented, a kid who has, you know, citizenship. So, millions of people can and will be impacted by this and already are. The fear in immigrant communities across this country is unlike anything that’s been seen in recent years. It’s already happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And so, what does it mean to expand the categories of people that can be targeted? Give an example.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD:\u003c/strong> So, under the — basically, the new rules, folks who are believed to have committed something that could constitute a criminal offense could be prioritized for deportation. Folks, who have just an immigration violation on their record — they just happened to have not been checked when they came across the border, could be prioritized for deportation. So, I mean, what this has done is cast such a wide net, and that’s why so many people are terrified right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Where are they gonna put all of these people that they round up in these ICE raids?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD:\u003c/strong> So, the executive orders have called for the expansion of a network of detention facilities along the U.S. border with Mexico, and they are to be built as quickly as possible, and that is including through private contracts. So, we are going to likely see a lot of these private prison companies, basically, trying to get in line to make money off of this. And that’s where these folks are gonna go. The administration has vowed to crack down on so-called catch and release policies that allow folks to be outside of lockup while their cases are processed, so you’re gonna see a lot more people in cells. And if the administration doesn’t follow through on hiring more judges, then we’re gonna see the backlog, the historic backlog that we already have in immigration cases only grow as more and more people fill up these facilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ryan Devereaux is an investigative reporter at The Intercept. You should check out all of the reporting he’s been doing on the Trump administration, its executive orders, and what’s happening at the Department of Homeland Security at theintercept.com. Ryan, thanks for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo calling for the government’s continued use of private prisons, reversing an Obama administration directive to phase them out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Don’t believe for a second that Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ announcement that he was canceling this Obama-era order aimed at ending the use of private prisons in the U.S. is not related to the anti-immigrant tornado that is whipping across this country. The Correctional Corporation of America and other private prison companies stand to make a killing as a result of Trump’s emerging policies. And they thanked him. They thanked him by kicking in huge sums of money for his inauguration festivities. To discuss all of this, I’m joined by a great investigative journalist, Shane Bauer, who writes for Mother Jones. Shane spent four months working as a guard in a private prison in Louisiana, the Winn Correctional Facility. He’s also embedded with militias, and he spent more than two years in an Iranian prison after being snatched from Iraq, where he was reporting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shane Bauer, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Shane Bauer:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, Shane. You got hired by this private prison as a guard, despite the fact that you submitted a completely truthful application; you didn’t hide who you are. You didn’t hide that you’re a journalist. You weren’t undercover, per se. You submitted your real resume to this company. And why do you think it is that they didn’t seem to do any diligence on figuring out, you know, is this a person that should be working in this prison?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> The job pays $9.00 an hour. They’re very desperate for workers. So, you know, I got the sense — when I was doing the interviews, it was almost like they were trying to convince me to take the job. The person I was interviewing with in Louisiana asked me if I liked to hunt and fish, and she said, “People around here like to squirrel hunt, and, you know, so, there’s a lot of forest around here, if you want to do that.” [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wow. That sounds like a very probing question to make sure they’re not hiring an unhinged person to be around prisoners.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, most of the people that worked there were, you know, just kind of poor people from the town that needed jobs. It was kind of a mix of kids right out of high school, you know, 18, 19-year-old kids, and a lot of single moms, you know, that just kind of needed to get health insurance. And then there were some kind of war veterans and some police veterans that couldn’t really find other work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And what were your biggest takeaways from your experience working as a private prison guard?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> I mean it was very clear being inside that prison that the profit motive had a really significant impact on the prison. The guards’ pay was a big issue. That was much lower than the other prisons in the state. And the lower guard pay leads to issues of understaffing, ‘cause even in that poor town, people would not — didn’t want the job. A lot of guards sell drugs and bring contraband into the prison to just make ends meet. Healthcare was really impacted. I met a guy who lost his legs to gangrene, which he caught in the prison. He had been complaining for months of severe pain, going to the doctor, and they would just give him Motrin and send him back. And eventually, when it got very severe, he was sent to the hospital and had to have his legs amputated. And I saw this kind of issue come up a lot, where people were complaining of serious ailments, but were not sent out to the hospital. And when prisoners are sent out to the hospital, the company has to pay those expenses. And when they’re making, you know, 30-some dollars a day for a prisoner from the state, it’s a major expense to pay a hospital bill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Security was really low. I mean the company had been cutting positions to save money. I mean there’s constant pressure to lower costs. So, like the guard towers were empty, for example. There was a prisoner who escaped while I was there —just hopped over the fence in the middle of the day. You know, everybody there, prisoners and guards that I met, outside of the kind of high levels in the administration, really hated this company. And they would kind of bond on that sometimes. I would see guards and prisoners kind of talking to each other about, you know, how screwed they felt by the company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And how — so what’s the economic model behind this? I mean, how are these private prison corporations making their money?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB\u003c/strong>: So typically, the states will pay a per diem fee for each prisoner. So every prisoner, you know, in Louisiana, it was 30-some dollars a day. In California, it’s 60-some dollars a day. So that’s the bulk of the money that’s coming in. But the companies are also traded on the stock market. So, you know, most of the investors are banks and mutual funds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> In the week after Election Day, stocks of two major private prison companies increased dramatically.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> You know, we saw when Trump was elected, CCA stock rose dramatically. It was the highest raising stock in the entire stock market, probably because of expectations around immigration policy. You know, if more people are going to be detained, then potentially more detention centers are gonna need to be built. And CCA and the other major company, GEO, would probably be trying to run those.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And more recently, you had the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, reversed an order that was issued last year by President Obama that effectively said that the government is supposed to phase out the use of private prisons. When you heard that news, what were the first thoughts that came to mind in terms of the implications of this, or what this indicated to you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> I was not surprised by this decision. But I will say, when the first — the Obama-era decision came through to stop using private prisons, that was very surprising and significant to me. And it meant that 20-some thousand people were not going to be living in these prisons that have been much more violent. They’re bare bones holding tanks, essentially. And so, it was significant that, you know, this number of people were not gonna be there. And I think as soon as Trump was elected, that was one of my first thoughts, that that decision was going to reversed, like many other decisions, and kind of moves forward have been. And, you know, Sessions — there were a couple of Sessions aids that became lobbyists for one of these companies. There’s a huge revolving door, and, you know, I think it’s notable that these actions are being taken, given that private prisons are so unpopular. I mean there are very few defenders of private prisons in this country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is also a time when our prison population is declining. There’s been a lot of kind of bipartisan consensus on the need to reduce the prison population and to make some major changes. And I think when the original decision to stop using private prisons came through, a lot of people felt like that was, you know, a major step in kind of reforming our prison system. And, you know, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of support, necessarily, for these kind of decisions that the Trump administration is making.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and you as a reporter, you not only went and worked at a private prison, but you’ve also joined up with—I don’t like to use the term militia, but you’ve joined up with groups of armed individuals who believe it’s their mission to keep the illegals out of the United States. Maybe you could also talk about that experience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Three Percenter:\u003c/strong> The three percent today are gun owners who will not disarm, will not compromise, and will no longer back up at the passage of the next Gun Control Act. Three percenters today say quite explicitly that we will not obey any further circumscription of our traditional liberties, and will defend ourselves if attacked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, that — I spent some time on the U.S.-Mexico border with the Three Percent United Patriots, which is a nationally organized militia. And what was most remarkable about that experience to me was seeing how much the federal border patrol was working with these paramilitary groups. They — you know, I saw encounters between the border patrol and the militia where the border patrol, you know, approached us as we’re essentially coming through the desert in the middle of the night. And I thought that, you know, we would be kind of sent away. But instead, a guy who says that he’s an intelligence officer is telling the leadership of the militia where we should go, where we should set up. He took us on a — you know, a tour. You know, so they’re kind of using these paramilitary groups to do a lot of their own work. And this was under Obama, you know. So it’s hard to say, you know, what is going to happen now. I mean the border patrol has long been one of the most rogue federal agencies, and I can only imagine they’re feeling pretty empowered right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And given now that Trump, you know, he got the endorsement of the ICE union, although he tried to say that he was endorsed by the actual federal entity, the Immigration Customs Enforcement, and makes it a centerpiece of his speeches to, you know, give his Blue Lives Matter rap and to talk about the illegals and the criminals and the gangsters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones. We’re getting ‘em out. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How is that received by the Three Percenters and these other organization militia around the country that believe that what they’re doing is sort of Second Amendment, you know, revolutionary stuff to protect the country by expelling the criminals and hunting down the — it’s not just undocumented people. It’s also, you know, the Sharia law is coming to Oklahoma type mentality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, I have been in touch with some of those guys, including one person who left the group. And, you know, what I’m hearing is that the main — the pivot right now is kind of — they’re less focused on the federal government than they have been and than they typically are, and more concerned with protests, Black Lives Matter — that was always a scary thing to them — and Muslims. You know, these guys are obsessed with the idea that Muslims are taking over the country. I mean, when I was on the border operation with them, they would put pork fat in all of their food ‘cause they thought it would keep out Muslim infiltrators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] It sounds like they’ve got some very good operational security.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And so, when these groups, or specifically the group you were with, if they did encounter, you know, somebody trying to come into the United States across the border, or there was somebody wandering around that they believed to be a potentially undocumented person, what do they do?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> So, I was never really explained the protocol. But what I gathered just from going out with people on these operations was that we were supposed to radio the base. I mean, there essentially was a kind of small military base that they set up in the desert. We would radio there, and then they would call the border patrol, and the border patrol would show up. However, I mean, when I would go out on these operations, we’d leave in the base in the middle of the night. A lot of these guys, who are Afghan War veterans, Iraq War veterans — one of them had done multiple tours as a sniper in Iraq — they’re really amped up. And they’re, you know, talking about hunting Mexicans. So a lot of that is just, you know, rhetoric. But —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, but I mean, we have had —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> The idea of running —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Go ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> The idea of running into somebody in the middle of the night that jumps out from behind a bush, you know — it wasn’t hard to imagine things escalating pretty quickly. And at one point when I was out there, there were some guys that were pointing their guns at the border patrol that showed up, you know? There was a little standoff before they kind of realized who each other were.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And all of this, this is not happening in a — you know, in a political vacuum, particularly right now, because you have — it’s not even dog whistling from the White House. I mean, you really do have a kind of open, encouraging of what can amount to a war against undocumented people, transgender people, Muslims. And then you have these, you know, well-armed, angry characters who are roaming around thinking of themselves as defenders of the real America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And, you know — and we just had a black president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You have an increase in hate crimes. I mean, it’s a pretty scary landscape out there that’s been empowered by the rise of Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And I mean, this area is pretty lawless, and they kind of treat it as the last frontier in America. Also, the kind of line where they’re defending, you know, the rest of the country from this kind of wild land. But they’re — you know, they’re going out. They’re finding food and water bottles left by organizations in the desert, and, you know, they stab the water bottles. They destroy food. I mean they’re doing things that really impact the lives of people who are making these journeys across the desert. And, you know, they’re encouraged. I mean the border patrol encourages them to do that. The local police I saw encouraging them to do that. The border patrol does it themselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and it seems like, you know, just the ginormous elephant in the room here is, if you’ve gotten empowerment of these militia types, and then you have a stated policy of round ‘em all up about undocumented immigrants, and you have an order to continue financing and using private prisons, it does seem like we’re witnessing the emergence of a policy here. I mean, we have essentially, you know, thousands of guys who have been doing paramilitary training aboveground, pretty much uninhibited, for eight years. These guys are really well trained.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, you know, there was kind of a way that I would hear people talk about militias as kind of writing them off as grownup Boy Scouts and, you know, stuff like that. And there’s some truth in that. I mean, a lot of these guys are just kind of wanting to get away from their home life and, you know, have some excitement. But, you know, I mean, it’s almost, you know, silly to even point out that if these guys were black or Muslim, I doubt we would have been hearing the same kind of rhetoric. But now we have, you know, these guys that are trained and ready, and if there is an escalation in some form, you know, in our society, we have highly trained paramilitary groups on the right that can either be deployed or just take action into their own hands.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Where is the — what’s the next insane group of people or terrible institution that you’re gonna go embed in or with?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] I’m not sure. I’m actually working on a book right now about private prisons, so I’m trying to stay out of something new.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] All right, cool. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. And more importantly, just thank you for all of your great work over these years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB\u003c/strong>: Yeah, thanks. Likewise. And I’m enjoying the podcast and looking forward to seeing where it goes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Thanks for being with us on Intercepted, Shane.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> All right, thanks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Phone ringing]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Yassin Alsalman:\u003c/strong> Hello?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yassin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> How you doing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. So you have a new song that we’re gonna premiere on The Intercepted podcast. What’s the name of the song and what’s the message behind it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA\u003c/strong>: The song is called “Fake News,” man. I guess the message behind it was really, you know — it was something that I wrote the day after the shooting happened in Quebec. I had been quiet for a while and sort of stayed away from direct messaging to what was going on in the world. And I felt this urge to get a lot of stuff off my chest based on what was going around and all the rhetoric that was going on about, you know, whatever: immigrants, refugees, Muslims, brown people in general, black people. And I figured the best way to tell it was in auto-tune, for some reason, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I thought it was funny, man, to hear, you know Steve — people will hear it in a second, but to hear Stephen K. Bannon’s name in auto-tune is pretty surreal. What’s that about?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> You have to find ways to be direct about what people should be paying attention to without force-feeding them anything, you know? So I wanted to write something that was sort of catchy, but also, in a way, tongue-in-cheek about the way politics is being presented as a TV show. That everything is almost on hyper-drive, everything is on steroids right now, like it’s all just a show. And we’re not thinking about the long-term impact of this thing, you know, of the new rise of, you know, sort of — of xenophobia all over the world, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what was it about Stephen Bannon that you wanted to highlight? Like why did you name check him in the song?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> Well, listen, I had a song called “Halliburton” back in the day, you know? So it’s like, this feels like Dick Cheney too, so it’s like, you know. And it’s, you know, Muslim bannin’, and it’s just Bannon. It’s in the name. It just — when you’re in the booth, and you know, if you “Muslim, they bannin’, they bannin’, they bannin’. So, you know, who do you look at? Holler at Stephen K. Bannon,” you know? That’s who wrote it. So it’s just — it’s the — it’s just the truth. I’m just saying what the reality is, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right.

President Donald Trump also believes he has a beef with the feds. This week on Intercepted, Trump accused Obama of tapping his phones, causing FBI director James Comey to lose his shit. Obama officials are denying it up and down and Trump’s surrogates are trying to figure out if their boss knows something they don’t. It sounds crazy, but is there anything to Trump’s tweets? We talk with Intercept investigative reporter Matthew Cole and muckraking journalist Marcy Wheeler of \u003ca href=\"https://www.emptywheel.net/\" target=\"_blank\">emptywheel\u003c/a>. Never count WikiLeaks out — the group just published a massive cache of CIA hacking secrets. The Intercept’s Sam Biddle and Josh Begley discuss what the revelations can teach us about our “smart” TVs and appliances and the security of chat apps like Signal and WhatsApp. As ICE raids intensify and deportations accelerate, independent journalist Aura Bogado confronts the opening stages of Trump’s assault on undocumented immigrants. Legendary punk band Anti-Flag performs for Intercepted from a garage in Pittsburgh. Plus, Donald Trump “stars” in “Goodfellas,” where he’s chased by the mob and the FBI.

Trump\u003c/strong>: If you’re a part of a crew, nobody ever tells you that they’re going to kill you. It doesn’t happen that way. There aren’t any arguments or curses, like in the movies. Your murderers come with smiles. They come as your friends, the people who have cared for you all your life. And they always seem to come at a time when you’re at your weakest and most in need of their help.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I met James Comey — Jimmy — in a crowded place we both knew. I got there 15 minutes early, and I saw that Jimmy was already there. He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up to the restaurant. He wanted to make sure I wasn’t tailed. He was jumpy. He hadn’t touched a thing. During the campaign against Hillary, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing her emails, just like we always would. But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Robert DeNiro as Jimmy Conway\u003c/strong>: It’s gonna be okay. I think you’ve got a good chance of beating the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: How?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD as JC\u003c/strong>: Well, you know that kid? You know, from the city we’re talking about? You know who I’m talking about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD as JC\u003c/strong>: That kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as he got pinched, he ratted everybody out. He ratted us all out. I know where he is. He’s hiding now. Know what I’m saying? Would you have a problem going with Anthony on vacation to take care of that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: No, not at all.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD as JC\u003c/strong>: Anyway, they got nothin’, huh?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: Now Jimmy had never asked me for facts to back up my tweets before. But now he’s asking me to go down to Florida to hit some balls and stay off Breitbart, Morning Joe, Fox &amp; Friends, Twitter. That’s when I knew I’d never come back from Florida with my insecure Samsung phone, with my @realDonaldTrump Twitter login, with the password — all caps — “AMERICA,” saved for convenience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Goodfellas” soundtrack]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: I was going to be busy all day. I had to send out some tweets to match some classified intelligence I just read on Breitbart. Turns out that Kenyan socialist had tapped Trump Tower. Nothing found — McCarthyism. I had to hit some balls on the course with some foreign guy whose name I can’t even pronounce, and hook him up with some Trump stakes on the al fresco patio at Mar-a-Lago. And then I had to find some Scotch tape for my necktie — Trump brand, Made in China, the best ties — to fly up to some customers I had back in Washington. At least Arnold got fired. Pathetic ratings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Arnold Schwarzenegger\u003c/strong>: You’re terminated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: Right away, I knew Jimmy didn’t respect my tweets. I knew I was going to get stuck with his fake questions about evidence. I only hammered on the damn Hillary emails at the end because his letter was so tremendous. And now, he didn’t want my tweets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RD as JC\u003c/strong>: What the fuck good are these things? They don’t even fit. What’s the matter with you? What do you, want me to pay for this shit? I’m not paying for it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: I didn’t say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed, he didn’t even say goodbye.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Goodfellas” soundtrack]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT\u003c/strong>: I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to the election. I knew my guys — Bannon, Gorka, Miller — always wanted my tweets. And since I was going to see them later in the afternoon to pick up a delivery, I was pretty sure I’d get my mojo back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Goodfellas” soundtrack]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill\u003c/strong>: This is Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode seven of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On Tuesday, Donald Trump jumped out from behind a screen in the White House and surprised a bunch of schoolchildren on a White House tour.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Children screaming]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In unrelated news, Trump also jumped on Twitter and apparently surprised the intelligence community by accusing former President Barack Obama of tapping him, or wiretapping, as he put it, Trump Tower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[The Notorious B.I.G, “Mo’ Money Mo’ Problems”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>The Notorious B.I.G\u003c/strong>: I don’t know what they want from me\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s like the more money we come across\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The more problems we see\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The Notorious B.I.G. famously alleged that the feds were angered by his flagrant nature, and therefore, they tapped his phones. It seems that Easy D, The Notorious DJT, also believes the feds had beef with him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNB\u003c/strong>: Federal agents mad ‘cause I flagrant\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Tap my cell and the phone in the basement\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Now, Trump’s spokespeople had a pretty brutal few days trying to explain what the hell Trump was talking about and where he actually got this information, and it still remains pretty damn murky. That’s because, as of now, it really does seem that it’s likely that Trump got it from this bizarre labyrinth of rumors that ended up on Breitbart News as a story. And of course, Breitbart News it the official publication of Hair Force One. But defend it, the administration did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kellyanne Conway\u003c/strong>: He’s the president of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer\u003c/strong>: I think the president’s tweets speak for themselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u003c/strong>: The president firmly believes that the Obama administration may have tapped into the phones at Trump Tower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Now, a bunch of Obama-era intelligence officials, they also rushed onto TV to say, “We have no idea what Trump’s talking about.” Though some of those denials were curious, and we’re gonna discuss that in a few minutes. But where the story gets really nutty is when James Comey enters the scene. James Comey, of course, is the FBI director, and he was one of the only officials that Trump kept in their top positions when the transition happened from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. And Comey, as you recall, gave what many viewed as this boost to Trump in the waning moments of the campaign against Hillary Clinton, when he published this memo basically saying, “Hey, this investigation into her emails is really intensifying.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, it seems now that James Comey is probably not gonna get any invitations to hang out at the Winter White House any time soon. The New York Times reported that when Comey read Trump’s tweets about President Obama tapping Trump Tower, that he asked the Justice Department to go and actually publicly reject Trump’s assertions. Now, that has not happened, and it very well may not happen. Now, the Trump strategy seems to be shifting to push from his Twitter feed over to Capitol Hill, and assign the Republicans on the intelligence committees and others in Congress to use public funds to retroactively investigate and come up with evidence to prove that what Trump was saying on Twitter, that he likely obtained from Breitbart, that it actually is true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hallie Jackson, MSNBC:\u003c/strong> So, bottom line: Why would the president want Congress to investigate for information he already has?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> I think there’s a separation of powers aspect here, as I mentioned to Jonathan, that we think it’s —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HJ:\u003c/strong> So you talk about resources and time. Why waste that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s not a question of waste it. It’s a question of appropriateness.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ayesha Rascoe:\u003c/strong> So, but President Trump’s Twitter statements shouldn’t be taken at face value about what —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS:\u003c/strong> Sure it should. Of course it — I mean, why — what? No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, just because Trump’s making allegations on Twitter based on whatever he last read on Breitbart or saw on TV doesn’t mean there isn’t something to actually discuss here and to look at carefully. And what we want to do now is actually sift through this, analyze it, see if there is a there there, or if there is some shred of legitimacy to even digging into this story. Now, remember, Obama’s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, he lied under oath on this issue of whether the NSA was collecting personal data on millions of Americans. We know the NSA has vast surveillance powers. The FBI also has vast surveillance powers, and the FBI also has a pretty dirty record of politically motivated surveillance. And with this Trump &#8211; Russia shit, there’s definitely a lot of smoke there, especially when it comes to people like his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page. And then you have this, like, pandemic of amnesia that has just struck the Trump inner circle over who met with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff Sessions:\u003c/strong> Uh, I don’t recall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, is it possible that a so-called FISA warrant, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, was ordered that authorized the surveillance of one or more Trump associates or physical property? That FISA order would be needed for certain kinds of surveillance in the United States or against American citizens. Or was there a criminal warrant that authorized some sort of surveillance connected to Trump associates or Trump property? Former officials and the current FBI director, they appear to be saying no, no to both. But moreover, if there was some sort of surveillance, was it actually aimed at Donald Trump or his campaign, or is there something we just don’t know yet about who may have been investigating whom for what? With this administration, it’s a really fucking insane challenge, given the tangled web of private interests, conflicts of interest, lies, misdirection, and a side order of total batshit insanity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Joining me now to break this down into something we hope vaguely resembles an explanation are two people. Matthew Cole is an investigative reporter here at The Intercept. His latest bombshell expose really is like a small book called “The Crimes of SEAL Team 6.” It’s a phenomenal work of journalism, and I recommend everyone read it. And we’re joined by Marcy Wheeler. She is, without a doubt, one of the smartest, most dogged researchers and journalists I know. Her website, emptywheel, is really must-read for people that truly geek out on national security and secrecy and espionage. I want to welcome Marcy Wheeler to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Marcy Wheeler:\u003c/strong> Thanks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole, good to have you here too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Matthew Cole:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Marcy, let’s begin with you. So walk us through your analysis of this whole\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump wiretap mess.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW: \u003c/strong>It’s a game of telephone that ends up in a Breitbart article that Trump reads and kind of goes nuts. But it goes back to a story on a server that was — Trump’s server that was pinging Alfa Bank in Russia, and also Spectrum Health here in Grand Rapids. You guys debunked it. I debunked it. A bunch of security people said, “Here’s what it really probably is.” Very importantly, it was about a server in Philadelphia, not a server in Trump Tower. But this former Tory MP rock star promoter wife turned investigative tweeter wrote about it. She got a tip that there was a FISA order on — you know, associated with the Trump investigation. She wrote about it, and she said that the server in question was in Trump Tower. Andrew McCarthy picked it up and said it was improperly investigating crimes versus intelligence. There was the whole EO 12333 sharing thrown in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So Breitbart packages that up and at each stage kind of makes it worse. Trump, coming off a really angry response to Jeff Sessions recusing from the Russian investigation, reads it, and then just goes nuts on Saturday morning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>And now, we had James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, said on some of the Sunday shows:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>James Clapper:\u003c/strong> I can’t speak officially anymore, but I will say that for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president, the president-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You parsed some of his words and found some interesting gaps in what he didn’t say, or how he said the things that he did. And we should say that James Clapper himself is a known, proven liar on the issue of what kind of data is being collected on American citizens. So talk about James Clapper’s response to all of this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> This FISA order story has only been reported on by an American journalist with McClatchy’s single source confirming it. Everything else has been British. And the more credible versions of that story say it was targeted at not just Alfa Bank, but another Russian bank. And that by itself didn’t make a lot of sense. But in any case, he denied a narrow claim, which is that anybody associated with Trump’s campaign was the target of the FISA order. And remember that key people that we’ve been talking about, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page, both left the campaign. So once they leave, are they then fair game to not be included in that denial for James Clapper? Given his least untruthful statements in the past, could be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So Marcy, for people that don’t follow this stuff on a granular level like you do, just explain what a FISA court order is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> As used in this description, it has been taken to mean an individualized order used to collect in the United States. So if James Clapper or Jim Comey wanted to wiretap you or me, he would have to go to the FISA court, and they’d have to say, “Okay, you know, Jeremy Scahill, bad guy, Marcy Wheeler, bad girl. We’re gonna individually wiretap that person.” You can also target it at a facility. So you can target it at, say, a bank, or a server. But generally speaking, what we’re talking about is individualized orders to conduct intelligence wiretapping in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But again, the other important thing to remember is, the intelligence community has this kind of gimmick on language, such that if they were targeting Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, and we know they did, and an American spoke to Anwar al-Awlaki, then that American would also be picked up, but would not be treated as the target of that surveillance. That would be called incidental collection. It doesn’t give the American any more protections. It’s just the intelligence community’s easy way of excusing the fact that they’re collecting on all these Americans, and they don’t have a warrant or any probable cause for these other people, just that they’re talking to Anwar al-Awlaki.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole, in the bigger picture here, there’s been a debate about whether or not there is a Deep State. You’ve spent the better part of your life as a journalist investigating covert Navy SEAL operations, the inner workings of the CIA. What is your read on these questions around Trump’s relationship with the intelligence community, and if there is a sort of secret heroic cabal within the intelligence community that is fighting to save us all from the Trump administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> The question of Deep State is sort of, as many things are in our current political environment, sort of a mishmash of multiple things. And some of it is legitimate, and some of it’s illegitimate. I think that there’s no question that the national security state, the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, are comprised of professionals who spend 20 to 30 years working in those jobs, sometimes more. And those jobs don’t turn over when presidents leave and enter the White House. And so, there is a continuity there that makes them both experts and also the people who move the levers within the executive branch for collection, for activity, for espionage. And to the extent that those people have worked together, have knowledge that the average American doesn’t have, that politicians, who until they become president or get the kind of security clearance and access that they can get in, never see, that does exist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the possibility or the ability to manipulate or use information that’s behind that, you know, on the “high side,” as they call it, the very classified wall that is behind top secret clearances — it is absolutely possible. And we know historically that presidents use that secrecy to omit and hide, and then selectively reveal or leak out other parts of a narrative to push, you know, a political gain of theirs, whether it’s getting re-elected or, you know, trying to sell a war, if you want to call that the Deep State, then there absolutely is a Deep State.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the other hand, I don’t think that what we’re seeing here is the noble work of intelligence professionals who are trying to save the republic from the disaster that could be President Donald J. Trump. I think what we are seeing is a concerted effort to leak what may have been picked up in the waning days of the Obama administration, and where there is any sense of smoke in this narrative, they are leaking all of the smoke. And I just want to say I’m not knocking the reporters, by the way. I’m not implicitly knocking the reporters. The Post and the New York Times and CNN have done a great job. They’re doing a fantastic job of reporting out what the intelligence professionals under the previous administration, and to some extent, the carryover into this administration, believe is smoke.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, they imply — all of it seems to imply that there’s fire  — that there is deep collusion between the president and his men with Putin and the Russian government. There has been zero evidence to show that thus far. And where the Deep State narrative gets grafted onto that, that becomes, I think, very troubling and dangerous because we don’t know who the officials who are leaking the information is, and we, I think — you know, I go back to Brennan’s last public statements when he was still Director of Central Intelligence. He went on the Fox News program with Chris Wallace. And to be honest, he was sort of stunning, that there was a sitting head of U.S. intelligence, when asked a question about whether or not the U.S. intelligence community had gathered evidence that the incoming president, the president-elect, had colluded with a foreign adversary, he didn’t deny it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Brennan:\u003c/strong> And so, if we did come into contact with that type of information, it would have been shared with the FBI, and we would make sure that our intelligence committees then were aware of it as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> That is really stunning, and a real act, I think, of partisan — you know, political — you know, he was acting like a political hack on the behalf of his former boss, the president, for whom he was very close to and very loyal. And in that regard, you end up with Donald Trump coming in as president, furious with the intelligence agencies. And I’d argue he has a right to be. That — you know, they made a very clear message that, “we don’t like you, we don’t want you. You may even be illegitimate. And to the extent that you may be illegitimate, we’re gonna try to dig it up.” You’re getting this war going between the president in the White House and the intelligence agencies. And there have been times in this mess thus far that I’ve been sympathetic to the White House, because it is dangerous if there is no fire. If it’s just smoke, then the repetitive accumulation of leaks, it threatens the stability of the executive branch. And leave aside who is currently occupied in the White House, that is — that, to me, is really scary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Matthew Cole clearly is not auditioning for a job as political pundit on MSNBC, and he will not be cited in a positive way by the chief of the resistance, Keith Olbermann.  Marcy Wheeler, I wanted to ask you: David Frum, former George W. Bush speechwriter, who now is being celebrated by a lot of the law and order Democrats as this ally of theirs, tweeted recently, “The Deep State, otherwise known as uniforms that guard you while you sleep.’” What’s your read on this whole discussion about the Deep State with regard to the Trump administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> I would echo Matthew’s comments that he described what John Brennan said on his way out the door, not denying that there was evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians. The less noticed aspect of what Clapper said on Sunday, he denied far more categorically that they had any evidence of collusion when he left.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say our — that’s NSA, FBI, and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence — that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was evidence of that included in our report.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chuck Todd:\u003c/strong> I understand that. But does it exist?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Not to my knowledge.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> So you can go through January 20\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> both he and Brennan were gone, and at that point, there was no evidence that the IC had seen of any collusion between Trump and Russians with regards to the hack of the Democrats. One of the other things that I think is going on — I mean, there are two possibilities. One is there are things that are illegal, and there are things that are impeachable, and it is possible that the IC has determined unto itself that they believe there is impeachable stuff affecting Trump, whether it’s that he does business with a bunch of mobbed up Russians, whether it’s that he is favorable to a bunch of Russians in a way that stinks. And one of the things that feels like is happening that they’re pointing the way towards not any criminal charges against Trump, but towards impeachment. And I think Matthew’s right, but that’s a little bit dangerous for the CIA to make in the dark. These decisions are meant to be political decisions made by members of Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then the other thing that does need to be said is Trump ran on being friendly to Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT\u003c/strong>: An easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Whether you like that policy or not, he was upfront about the fact that he wanted to be far friendlier to Russia than Obama had been, and that put his policy in a far more conciliatory position than CIA’s policies. At that level, I think it is possible what we’re seeing is a policy disagreement, that Trump is talking to Russia’s ambassador of the United States because they want to establish warmer relationships with Russia. But from the CIA’s perspective, that deems Russia this increasingly grand threat that is deemed suspect in a way that really, the evidence thus far doesn’t support.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> What would the grounds be for the impeachment? If they’re gathering that way, what would be the grounds to do it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Well, you know, I think the idea is that Trump is susceptible to blackmail by the Russians, or maybe this insinuation that he wants to be friendlier with the Russians because he has all these business deals with mobbed up Russian businessmen. I don’t know. I mean, but that’s what it feels like to me, is that the smoke is meant to sustain an impeachment. And, you know — and of course, that in and of itself is suspect ‘cause most Republicans would prefer to see Mike Pence as president than Donald Trump. And ultimately, impeachments are political events. I don’t know that the evidence is there, but I can see how Congress would get picked up in a frenzy and impeach Trump based on all this stuff coming out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the things that I think is very — that strikes a chord with me, Marcy, in what you’re saying is that I do think we are going to see, from certain quarters of the establishment, Republican Party, particularly people close to Dick Cheney, is more and more discussion about the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment to the Constitution, and this idea that Trump could sort of be, you know, declared an invalid, basically, or Trump could decide that he just doesn’t want to be president anymore. And as you point out, Mike Pence is, for all practical purposes, Dick Cheney’s guy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> You know, this administration is a pretty fascinating one because it’s a massive conflict. There is a fissure — tectonics plates that are rubbing up against each other between, you know, essentially Breitbart versus the RNC. The GOP establishment, which Pence represents: Priebus versus Bannon and Miller. And on the one side, the Breitbart side, you’ve got these guys coming in saying, “We’re gonna get rid of an entire layer of government.” I mean, this is Reaganism on steroids, which is we want no government, effectively. We want chaos. I mean, you know, I’ve seen some of Trump’s cronies defending him by saying, “this is what he does best. He does chaos. He brings it in, and then he manages the thing, and it’s brilliant.” And you almost wonder if he isn’t crazy like a fox, to a certain extent. And then you have the establishment guys. You have the hard line, old line, GOP, you know, Tillerson, Secretary of State Tillerson, is there because former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates recommended him, and so did former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, and of course —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who also has a Chevron oil tanker named after her —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Right. And — but Gates, Rice, and Hadley have a consulting company together. And they represent the, you know, to the extent that we’re describing it here, the Dick Cheney &#8211; George W. Bush — I mean, you know, the Bush 43 wing of the party. And they, of course, are, in terms of government, total professionals. Leave aside ideology, you know, just for a second. They are in fact professionals. And you have this Breitbart wing, which is the opposite. They campaigned on not being professionals. They want — they’re draining the swamp. And clearly it’s working, right? Even, you know, from week to week, the chaos that’s going on is phenomenal. It’s an amazing political civil war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I want to close by talking about the issue of Yemen. I mean, first of all, just to step back and say that we’ve now seen more air strikes, whether drones or conventional aircraft, in just a matter of days by Donald Trump than we did in the entire last year of Obama’s presidency. And one of the things that I think is happening here — and I say I think, just as someone who’s followed this closely — is that it’s an attempt to justify that raid by saying, “We’re running the deck now. We’re gonna knock all of these guys out. And this is all based on the intel that we gathered, and therefore, the fact that we lost a Navy SEAL is justifiable because we’re just pounding the hell out of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Matthew Cole, I mean, again, I want to emphasize that’s a theory of mine. I’m not saying I have any evidence to suggest that. But I think it’s a solid theory. What’s your read on what’s happening now in Yemen with the Trump administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> They sold it. I know this. They sold the raid to him as this could be your Bin Laden raid, because they were going after somebody. It was not computers. You don’t send 30 members of SEAL Team 6 into a country that is not a declared war zone, for computers. It just doesn’t happen. And they said, “Hey, this could be your thing. You could really make a dent in al Qaeda and make a big splash early on, you know, like Bin Laden.” And in that sense, SEAL Team 6 is a brand, you know, the ultimate brand for a new president. I will say that we know from our own reporting that JSOC has been wanting to push into Yemen and increase their strikes and increase their raids against al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula for some time. And the Obama administration resisted. And to the extent that there was a new lease on life under the Trump administration so far, we are seeing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that’s why there are reports coming out of the Trump White House considering delegating down the authority to conduct Special Operations raids and strikes in Yemen, for instance, without having to go up to the White House, as previously done in the Obama administration. And there’s no question, also, that subsequent to the raid, there’s been a huge effort by the administration to try to sell the thing as successful, and leaking out to Barbara Starr, of all people —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Pentagon spokesperson who masquerades as the CNN Pentagon correspondent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> When Barbara Starr reports it, it’s a pretty good indication that you’re getting a Pentagon-approved story to help shift the narrative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barbara Starr:\u003c/strong> Vital intelligence that supports future victories. Some pretty key words there to watch, Jake. We should expect to see more missions like this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> You know, I think that it’s possible that some of it is done to justify, but I do know that JSOC and the SEALs, in particular, the counterterrorism world inside the Pentagon, wanted to go into Yemen for the last year-and-a-half.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Marcy, you know, we also have the fact that the Saudis have been waging this scorched earth bombing with the support of the United States, despite what, various officials may say about their concern over the weapons that the Saudis are using, or the hitting of civilian targets. This is all being done and largely sponsored by the United States and the refueling of the planes, the providing of intelligence, the use of U.S. weapons systems. And you also have the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is basically fighting two enemies on the ground inside of Yemen. They are fighting the southern Yemeni forces, but they’re also fighting the Houthis, which the United States claims to be trying to unseat in this proxy war between the Saudis, and to an increasing extent because of the war, Iran. You followed this covert/overt Yemen war from the very beginning stages of the Obama administration. Where — what do you think is important to be looking at right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Both you and I have pointed to the many times in the past where the Saudis have been completely unreliable allies, or the Yemenis, although at this point, the Saudis are the ones running the show, where here’s a strike, here’s the intelligence to back a strike. And all of a sudden, somebody who’s actually a peace negotiator gets killed, rather than somebody who is really working for al Qaeda. We know in this raid that AQAP was tipped off, and they continued the raid anyway. And so, you know, I don’t think there has been enough attention on who tipped off AQAP about the raid, because that has happened over, and over, and over again, in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the other thing that I find really interesting, and I don’t know whether Matthew has insight on this, but — or you, Jeremy. But, you know, the role of Mattis in this, General Mattis, who Obama fired, as I understand it, partly because he was trying to pick a war with Iran. And so, he, A), I think, is responsible for pushing this raid that was ill thought out. But also, you know, he’s gotten more authority out of it. He’s about to be able to authorize his own strikes, which is something that Obama really tried hard to kind of micromanage. And so, I’m really curious about his role in all of this, his trying to prove that his more aggressive stance that Obama rejected will work, and to kind of prove himself for Trump. I don’t know if that’s going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, let me ask, Matthew, you know, there has been this turf war that has flared up and gone down, depending on the administration and what actions are being authorized by the White House between the DOD, particularly Special Operations Forces within the DOD, and the CIA. Mattis was a former CENTCOM commander, and combatant commanders often do want to be viewed as — they used to be called the commanders-in-chief of their combatant command. And so what Marcy is saying, I think, does — it’s an interesting line to pursue, given that Mattis is of that system and also ran up against President Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> We will see a power grab from Mattis, and we’ll see a pushing to go back to Bush 43 delegation of authorities to the Pentagon. And part of that is, I think — my read on that is actually, Mattis is doing what he sees as the most responsible thing, which is taking the decision away from the president and acting as a counterbalance from ultimately the commander-in-chief, who has the ultimate authority, but who, if willing to delegate some of that authority down, you’re giving it down from, you know, an impetuous teenager to an adult, even if it’s an adult who was once fired for trying to start a war with Iran. It may be —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You’re not setting me at ease here, Matthew.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> It’s — well, you know — I don’t sleep at night anymore, which is why I have three cups of coffee every morning. But that’s my read, that Mattis is actually maybe one of the few adults in the room, and the cost of it is, is that he’s going to try to grab as much power as he can back from this White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Marcy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> I think that brings us back to the question of the Deep State. When we’re — it may not be CIA that’s gonna rescue us from Donald Trump, but it might be the generals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, lord. Okay. Well, I’ll dissent from you two wise sages on that one. Just finally, Marcy, what’s one story you think that people should be paying attention to that’s not getting coverage?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> One of the things that Democrats are doing, and they’re really pushing this Russian story because they believe it’s the short route to get rid of Donald Trump. And that comes at the cost of actually paying attention to what’s happening with his policies rolling out. There’s the immigrant ban, but especially the environmental things he’s doing. And I know — I mean, I’m in Michigan. I’m in the state that screwed you guys all over because we voted for Trump. But the response to his EPA funding, for example — he gutted the Great Lakes Initiative — has actually been really aggressive. And those are the things that I think are pissing people off way out here in flyover country. But there’s this big disjunct between what people in D.C. and New York want to talk about Trump, and what people who maybe are feeling these policies in a way that’s more direct are feeling, and the environmental policies, I think, are one of them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole, one story that’s not getting enough attention that you think should.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s North Korea. And it’s getting some attention, but it’s not getting enough. Because I think that North Korea is to Donald Trump what Iran was to President Obama when they came into office, which is the real hot button issue. And it’s worse because Iran, the accusation was that they were trying to get and create a nuclear bomb and weaponize one. And North Korea has nuclear bombs, and has improved their weapons and ballistics missiles technology. It was a little scary when Trump met Obama for the first time in that White House meeting shortly after the election, and it came out that the thing that scared the shit out of Donald Trump was whatever Obama told him about North Korea. There’s no such thing as too much coverage or attention being paid to the issue of North Korea right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole, thanks for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Marcy Wheeler, thank you for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Marcy Wheeler joined us from Grand Rapids, Michigan. She runs the website emptywheel. And Matthew Cole is my colleague here at The Intercept. Coming up, we’re gonna dig into some of the details of this massive dump of CIA hacking documents released by WikiLeaks. And we’re gonna look at the realities facing undocumented immigrants in the U.S. now that Trump is in power. We’ll also hear a song from the punk band Anti-Flag. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we’re back on Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill. We turn now to the WikiLeaks publication of this humongous cache of internal CIA documents. We at The Intercept are still going through this initial batch. It’s more than 8,700 files, and WikiLeaks says there’s more to come. They’re all from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. And according to WikiLeaks, contained within these files is the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. It’s important to note that these documents indicate that the CIA itself lost control over the secrecy of these documents connected to its own hacking operations, and unredacted versions of these files almost certainly are in the hands of other players in the United States, potentially around the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We’re gonna be covering this extensively in the days and weeks to come at The Intercept, but for an initial take on what some of these documents have to say about apps that we use, encrypted apps on our phone, like WhatsApp or Signal, and our personal so-called smart appliances that many people — or increasingly, people have in their houses, I’m joined by two of my colleagues, Josh Begley and Sam Biddle. Josh, welcome to the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Josh Begley:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sam Biddle is our first two-time guest. Welcome back to the podcast.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sam Biddle:\u003c/strong> And may there be many more. Thanks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, Sam, what’s the big takeaway for ordinary people, people that are not running around with classified documents or are not organizing terrorist attacks, but are, you know, ordinary people concerned about their privacy? What did we learn about the capabilities that the CIA and its allies have that could impact ordinary folks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB: \u003c/strong>So luckily, there doesn’t seem like there’s much so far in the documents suggesting any kind of targeting of a mass or blunt sweeping nature. You know, these are targeted attacks. They require some real effort and in some cases, legwork of actually, you know, plugging in a USB drive into a device the CIA wants to infect. Now, there are a lot of these attack methods, and they are very sophisticated. So, you know, this does provide more detail on what we sort of already knew about the CIA. And of course, the NSA does the same thing too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And now, with like the — with the rise of Alexa and Amazon Echo and Siri, etc., and what they call the Internet of things, where you have these so-called smart TVs, what do the documents reveal to us about how the Internet of Things can cause serious problems for privacy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> The example in the documents that stands out to me the most is an attack called Weeping Angel — that was the CIA code name for it — that targets Samsung smart TVs. Samsung is a giant of electronics manufacturing. They sell one of the most popular models of TVs every year. They’re in a lot of people’s living rooms and bedrooms. This method would trick Samsung TVs into basically being turned off. So the screen would be off, the lights would be off, but actually, the guts of the TV would remain on. And the microphone that is now in so many smart TVs for voice recognition controls would be rolling and would be recording, and then relaying that information back to a third party, presumably controlled by the CIA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So like, the ‘60s hippies who were saying, “Don’t have a TV. They use the TV to spy on you” — they actually may have been up to — you know, onto something?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB: \u003c/strong>Well, yeah. I mean, that’s just the reality of buying electronics now in 2017, is that they are filled with things we don’t really want. It’s hard to find a TV or a streaming music speaker that doesn’t have a microphone or some sort of always on capability. And, you know, I think this is a really good example of not something that ordinary people need to be worried about, by any means, unless they’re, you know, meeting with Vladimir Putin in a hotel room with a Samsung TV in it. But this is just the reality now. If companies are going to build these gadgets that have microphones, the CIA is going to take advantage of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alexa, turn off Sam’s mic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB and JB:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alexa, turn on Josh Begley’s mic. Do these documents show that WhatsApp and Signal have been hacked?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB: \u003c/strong>So, they do not. I’m still reading the documents, but for me, the biggest takeaway is that Signal works, and that you should use it, and unless you are a high value target of the CIA, anything you say will be just fine. I think that the main takeaway is also that in order to break so-called the encryption on Signal or WhatsApp, you have to have root access to the device, which is a very expensive thing. It’s a thing that agencies can do, but it costs them a lot of money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What — one of the things that we reported on, you and I, in 2015, in a piece that’s on theintercept.com called “The CIA Campaign to Steal Apple’s Secrets,” is what the CIA, NSA, GCHQ — the British intelligence equivalent of the NSA — that they were trying to access the actual firmware on the phone as a way of circumventing any kinds of protection. So talk about — because WikiLeaks framed this as basically that they have a way of working around the encryption of Signal in order to be able to read your encrypted communications. Well, what are some ways that we’ve learned that the CIA or other intelligence agencies are able to do that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> The CIA, since before the Apple iPhone was announced, had been working on methods to crack Apple’s encryption and to be able to get inside of an iPhone or an iPad. Since 2005 or 2006, they have held annual secret jamborees held at Lockheed Martin’s facility in Virginia, where researchers would test out and sort of relay research showing different attempts to get inside of Xcode, and inside other parts of the Apple operating system that signs software. And effectively, the message is that since Apple has been making phones, the CIA has been trying to find ways to get inside of them. But this is not really possible in a sort of mass surveillance way. It’s only possible in a targeted way, because Apple’s encryption is pretty good. And Signal and WhatsApp also have very strong protocols. So the only way to really get inside of these apps is to hack the phone itself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I basically — and when I’m talking to relatives, family members who are writing to me today, saying, you know, “You got us to use that Signal, and now I’m reading that it was hacked” — the way I was sort of trying to explain it to my mom, for instance, is like, you can have five deadbolts on your door because you’re afraid of someone breaking into your house. But if the burglar is already there hiding somewhere, he’s gonna be able to steal your shit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Right. Yeah. This is basically like saying, “oh, someone can read your encrypted email if they’ve taken your laptop and know all your passwords.” And you know, it goes without saying that in a worst-case scenario, the precautions you take are going to be not worth a whole lot. But that doesn’t mean you should stop taking those precautions, you know. I think if anything, this — these disclosures today show why it’s important to take precautions because there are a lot of very sophisticated people out there, be they at the CIA or otherwise, trying to break these things. For all we know, the CIA has broken WhatsApp and Signal. WikiLeaks just hasn’t published any evidence supporting that. And until they have, or until someone has, we should use these tools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sam Biddle, thanks for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Of course.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Josh Begley, thank you for your inaugural appearance on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alexa, we’re done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Josh Begley and Sam Biddle are both journalists at The Intercept.

I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was Donald Trump last week, announcing his new initiative that’s supposedly intended to help victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. But many immigrant rights groups and activists denounced the announcement of VOICE, as Trump calls it, as a stunt, and a dangerous one at that, a stunt that reinforces the false notion that’s been promoted by Trump and his administration that there are somehow gangs of murderers and rapists and thugs roaming the country after illegally sneaking across the U.S. border.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Gang heads, gang members, killers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, there’s no doubt that undocumented immigrants commit crimes like documented immigrants or American citizens. But the very creation of this office and the fact that Trump promoted it at Congress, live address to the nation and to the world, and got praised for it by Democrats and Republicans alike, it was clearly aimed at justifying the widening attacks against immigrants that we’re seeing now in this country. I believe that what we’re seeing now is the beginning stages of Trump’s promised deportation offensive, his mass deportation offensive. And it’s being done under the guise of law and order and protecting real Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m joined now by independent journalist Aura Bogado. She recently has been contributing to Teen Vogue, a magazine that actually has emerged as an important news organization. It’s not a joke. It’s true. Teen Vogue is now a very good publication on the very issues that we talk about on this show and that we cover at The Intercept. I’ve worked with Aura before. I’ve known her for many years, and it’s a pleasure to welcome Aura Bogado to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Aura Bogado:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much for having me, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, Aura. Let’s begin with this announcement that Trump made at his Congressional address that they’re establishing what they call VOICE, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office. What was your reaction when you heard that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> I mean it’s absolutely ludicrous. It was also ludicrous that the press sort of lauded him as a unifying president suddenly, and kind of missed this big part in which immigrants are once again being scapegoated. I was really troubled by the fact that he announced this sort of immediately after Adam Purinton shot and killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Kansas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter\u003c/strong>: Fifty-one-year-old Adam Purinton allegedly opened fire on Kuchibhotla and his friend Alok Madasani after witnesses say he shouted, “Get out of my country!”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> This gentleman was a victim. He was a victim of white supremacy in Kansas, yet the narrative has sort of been switched into, you know, having people think that immigrants are these horrible, horrible criminals. At the same time, another part that’s really troubling for me, as an immigrant myself, is the idea that we’re once again placed into this position in which we have to guarantee the public, we have to guarantee non-immigrants, that we’re not criminals. And it is, I think, really about scapegoating. It’s really scary to me that an office is now, you know, being established to specifically deal with this sort of imaginary problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, now, you’ve covered this issue of the targeting of immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, and the mass deportations under Obama. And now, you know, we have, in one week, recently, you had 680 or so ICE raids. Is this a change in policy or an escalation under Trump, or is it a, as Trump sort of says, “Well, ICE is doing what it’s always done.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> Under Trump, it is a big shift in policy, in that who is deemed a priority for detention and for deportation has changed. So ICE agents who were somewhat beholden to the Obama administration in the past have much more free reign under Trump. So now, anyone who’s not only been convicted, but done something for which they could be convicted, fall under the category of a person who’s detainable and deportable. And so that’s what we’re seeing now. You know, I would say that’s nothing short of a war on immigrants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We have 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez who was taken by ICE while ICE was serving a warrant on his father. He’s in detention in Tacoma. He’s a DACA recipient. We have a group of men who were taken by ICE while they were leaving a homeless shelter in Virginia. No one knows where they are now. We have a 26-year-old woman, Sara Beltran-Hernandez. She’s originally from El Salvador. She has a brain tumor. She was awaiting an emergency operation in a hospital when she was detained by ICE. She was just released on bond. Most recently, a 22-year-old, Daniela Vargas, who was picked up by ICE immediately following a press conference in which she was, you know, vocally opposing deportations. She is now in detention in Louisiana. So what we know from the last month alone is that you can be picked up in your home while you’re hanging out with your family. You can be picked up while leaving a church where you were staying to keep warm. You can be picked up in a hospital while you’re awaiting a life-saving operation for your brain tumor. You can be picked up in the street just for talking about this. So there is a shift. There is a shift in priority.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I will say, though, that, you know, the architecture for all of this was certainly set up by the Obama administration. Obama, of course, introduced DACA, but even within that, there was this sort of narrative around the idea that some people were safe while others were not. So Obama famously pushed this “Felons, Not Families” narrative. He, you know, went on to say that several times. But the truth is that felons are families. That’s just the truth of the matter. Felons are part of families. So a lot of times, you have a family where one person may be a U.S.-born citizen. Another is a DACA recipient. Another may be convicted of something like robbing a liquor store and so forth. That’s a family. All of those people are in one family, right? Some are untouchable by ICE. Other have a sort of, at least under Obama, a temporary reprieve by DACA and weren’t being targeted. And others were the priority, the so-called felons, right? And that framing suspends the idea that people, human beings, regardless of their immigration status, are capable of redemption and rehabilitation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that’s how we got three million deportations under Obama, which is largely forgotten in all of this, right? There’s a lot of attention under — about DACA recipients, but what about their parents? What about their cousins? What about their uncles and aunts? That sort of remains to be seen, and that, I think has a lot to do with the way that the Obama administration framed deserving immigrants versus non-deserving immigrants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Memos that were released in the past couple of weeks, one of them called for a surge in immigration judges, and also for detention capabilities to be expanded. We also understand that some local police forces around the country are being told to clear spaces in their jails that would normally be used for criminals to now start housing people that are taken in some of these raids. And at the same time, you have Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, taking away the Obama era directives that were intended to end the use of private prisons. And upwards of 70 percent of immigration detainees are already housed in private prisons. So you’ve covered both the prison industrial complex and this, as you say, war against immigrants. What’s your analysis of these moves and their connectivity?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> Detention centers aren’t called prisons because immigration is technically a civil issue in the United States. They may have places in which people have been convicted of crimes, etc., but that’s why they’re detention centers and not prisons. The Obama directive was, you know, attempting to change a lot of that. And we see that a lot of detention centers are privatized and are — you know, do hold immigrants. And if you want to deport 11 million people, or even half of that — let’s say you want to deport five million people — it’s hard to just pick someone up and then drop them into another country. People need to be placed into detention for some period of time. The idea was that they would be there for a few days, maybe a couple of weeks, until they’re processed. We know that a lot of times, undocumented immigrants remain there for several weeks, or months, or even years, awaiting what an immigration judge is going to rule.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you want to deport five million people, you’re going to need to create a lot more beds, right? Right now, there are about 40,000 beds in which you can hold immigrant detainees. How far are they going to try to expand that? Is it gonna be double? Is it gonna be triple? Either way, that doesn’t reach the even million mark. If the idea is like, oh, well, people are only gonna temporarily be housed here, I think that the standards may be drastically reduced to be like more like campgrounds, or places where people really shouldn’t be living, under the premise that, well, they’re gonna be, you know, scurried through very quickly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And let’s remember, you know, how this is playing out in terms of the officials that Trump has put in these positions of power. You have, of course — we talked about Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller. But then you have the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is a racist, and has shown himself to be an open and public policy racist. And you have a xenophobic General John Kelly, who is heading up the Department of Homeland Security. He was actually the head of the militarized solution to all of this when he was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. It’s not just like this is sort of Trump saying, “Let’s do this.” He’s actually put people in a position of power that have long had an agenda, privately and in their public policy positions, against immigrants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Wolf Blitzer:\u003c/strong> If you get some young kids who are coming in — who manage to sneak into the United States with their parents, are Department of Homeland Security personnel gonna separate the children from their moms and dads?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Kelly:\u003c/strong> We have tremendous experience in dealing with unaccompanied minors. We turn them over to HHS, and they do a very, very good job of either putting them in kind of foster care or linking them up with parents of family members in the United States. Yes, I am considering, in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network — I am considering exactly that. They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> I mean, up and down, the entire administration, as you just pointed out, it’s just racist, after racist, after racist. People that have, you know, run publications, that have run commands, that have run, you know, campaigns that are just blatantly anti-immigrant, blatantly racist, on the record and off the record. And that is very much who is, I think, helping to craft these policies and will certainly help to enforce these policies. And so, you know, going back to your question earlier about like, is there a shift in policy? Again, I can definitely critique the Obama administration, but in terms of the tone — and maybe the tone isn’t the correct focus or word here, but in terms of the tone and, I think, the hatred, really, with which some of this is being thought out and implemented, it’s scary. This is different. This is very different.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How are people resisting or fighting back in various immigrant communities across the country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> I would say that in communities, in sort of the grassroots communities, small organizations, people are really, I think, coming up with creative ways of keeping tabs about where family members and certain community members are. There is a sort of growing, kind of underground network of people that are entering sanctuary. I think that there are conversations around who can house people in sanctuary, right? Like who can sort of afford in, you know, a certain city — who can afford to sort of have an immigrant or even up to an immigrant family in one of the rooms of their homes, etc.?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another thing that I’ve been hearing more and more of is that, you know, that the designation of a sanctuary city is just — it’s a false facade for something that’s — it makes you think that you’re going to be safe. But there really sort of is no safety, particularly under this administration. Again, the priority for deportation is increasingly becoming anyone and everyone who’s undocumented. So even in that, even at its face value, I don’t know how valuable it’s gonna be during the Trump era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, that was one of the — I mean, first of all, I will say I was very heartened to see how many both grassroots organizers, but also ordinary people, went out to the — to airports across the country when Trump’s Muslim ban was put into effect. But one of the things that we saw happen was this overwhelming focus on certain people from Iraq, for instance, who had worked with the U.S. military as part of the occupation and military presence there as translators or fixers. And what it seems like is happening as a result of that, and John McCain and Lindsay Graham have been advocating this, is that they’re gonna say, “Oh, well, we’re gonna take Iraq off the list because we don’t want any of the people that collaborated with our military during these operations to be swept up in it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think that’s part of what you’re getting at, is that if you make arguments that are aimed at sort of the politicians in Washington rather than confronting the reality of what this means for people, it ends up being — you end up chasing the tail all the time. And that brings me to the question for you, like what should ordinary people be doing right now to confront Trump’s immigration policies, these raids, and the expansion of these private prisons?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> You know, I think a good first step might be to remember that every single person is a human being. I think that that, even for myself in the past in different circumstances, can be really helpful in terms of thinking who is redeemable and who is worth saving, and sort of responding to what’s happening now with that framework. Because what’s happening now can only happen when you dehumanize people to the point that they’re disposable; when you dehumanize people to the point where they can be held in detention, and no one knows what the next step is; when you dehumanize people to the point where they can be deported to another country which they’ve tried to escape from.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think that a lot of this rests on dehumanization ­— everything from the VOICE program to the detentions and deportations — it all rests on the assumption that enough people are gonna go along with the idea that some people really aren’t human being enough. And I think that the best way to sort of combat that on an everyday and even on a small and large level is to remember that everybody, really is, everybody is a human being.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Aura Bogado, thank you for your work, and thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Aura Bogado is an independent journalist who most recently has been contributing to Teen Vogue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To end today’s show, we turn to the Pittsburgh-based punk band Anti-Flag.

And most frequently, this happens without us realizing it.” This week, Intercepted broadcasts from the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. Snowden joined us via video feed from Moscow. He discusses Trump’s allegations that Barack Obama tapped Trump Tower and analyzes some of the CIA’s hacking capabilities. Snowden also offers his analysis of the “deep state” and blasts critics who accuse him of being a Russian agent. We interview the Libyan-American hip-hop artist \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thisisKayem\" target=\"_blank\">Kayem\u003c/a> (formerly known as Khaled M) about his regular detention at U.S. airports, visits from the FBI, and an incident where a police officer asked him to describe the contents of a Koran in the glove compartment of his car. Kayem, who has kept a low profile the past several years, is back on the road performing new music. He shares some verses with Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Anthony Atamanuik as Donald J. Trump\u003c/strong>: Live from South by Southwest. Isn’t this unbelievable? The home of Alex Jones. The home of incredible liberalism. I mean, you people — 6\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Street right now is a mess. A total and complete mess. There are people vomiting everywhere, and we all know it. And we’ve got such an incredible show, Intercepted. And it is — it’s all Intercepted. But only for Hillary. And one of the great guys, this Snowden guy. I mean, this guy’s truly snowed in. He’s in Russia. He’s trapped there. And I wish he helped me out more in the election, I’ll tell you that. He’s gotta get in touch with the other guys, and we’ve gotta release everything. Release it all. Except the pee video. Please. And now, the Intercepted! Intercepted —what do we call it? Steve? Where’s Steve? I’m tired. I gotta pee.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill\u003c/strong>: This is Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: All right. This is episode eight of Intercepted, and we are live in Austin, Texas, at South by Southwest, and we have an incredible show. We have an opportunity to talk live with the man himself, Edward Snowden. But first, we’re gonna begin by talking about something — first of all, I want to say this. I think it was really fucked up, this whole situation that happened with SXSW and the letters that were sent out to musical acts. And they tried to walk it back, and they tried to say, “Oh, well, we didn’t actually — we didn’t actually mean that we were gonna cooperate with ICE or DHS.” But it was a problem. And some bands got these letters that clearly, at this moment, with Donald Trump in power, with the Muslim ban, with the targeting of immigrants in this country; it’s at a minimum, tone deaf on SXSW’s side.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But in a different context, if you think about it, what were they thinking to send that kind of a letter out at this exact moment? And one of the ways that we wanted to respond to that was by having an artist, who is a Muslim, whose origin is from one of the countries that’s being targeted in Trump’s Muslim ban, whose family members were killed resisting the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. He’s an incredible hip-hop artist and activist, and he goes by the name Kayem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Cheering and applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kayem\u003c/strong>: What’s up, man?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: All right. So, Kayem, I’ve done a lot of reporting about the No Fly List, about the watchlisting system, the various ways that you can end up in the matrix, and you yourself, in 2013, found yourself in a situation where you were being targeted at airports. So why don’t you share a little bit about your experience traveling while Muslim?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Yeah. I definitely — first of all, I’m gonna thank you, because it’s been a really tough three years. I just got off the list, and now you’ve got me on the same episode with Edward Snowden. So thank you for that, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Congratulations on getting back on the list today. Maybe SXSW is gonna call them up, be like, “I’m sorry. There must have been an oversight.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Ask him if he needs a roommate in Russia. It was trying, man. It all started — I mean, I had always had issues where I couldn’t check in online and stuff. That’s kind of just normal Muslim experience. But I think it started getting worse coming back from Toronto in 2013. I was detained in Michigan for six hours, which is the maximum time they can detain you before they have to send you somewhere else. It was really scary because the way they treat you is like there’s something really big and bad going on, really aggressive. They ended up separating me from my family and putting me in a jail cell. And, you know, eventually a man just came and told me, you know, “An agency is coming to get you.” And I had no idea what he meant. I thought he meant I’m in Guantanamo Bay. I don’t know what’s going on. And this agency — it turned out to be a local cop from Monroe County for like — there was a time when I was like — my license plate was tilted and I got pulled over on the highway, so it was like improper display of registration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Very suspicious, man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: That’s some ISIS shit right there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: And I remember that incident. That was like 2006. I remember the incident. That’s my fault. I was like a teenager, and I’m just like, oh, I got a ticket in Michigan. I don’t think I ever paid it. But I remember that time, he ended up searching the car. He found a little copy of the Quran in the glove box, like my mom’s copy. I was driving her van.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: What were you thinking? Practicing your religion?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Well, he asked me. He asked me straight up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: This is America!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: [Laughs] He was like, “What does it say? What does it say in here?” I was like, “You want me to break down the whole Quran?” But anyway, that was the beginning. Then after that, I wouldn’t be able to get boarding passes. One time, I was flying from Chicago to Kentucky. I passed all the extra quad S stipulations, which is like, you know, when you get to security, you have to see a supervisor. They go through each individual item if you have a carry-on. I had to stop taking carry-ons. And they would wipe it with the little explosive stuff and kinda arbitrarily throw out — like I’d have a case of 50 CDs, and like 30 of them would be explosive and 20 wouldn’t. They’d throw all that stuff out. They take pictures of every page in your notebook. I remember like — they take a picture. I said something about Saddam Hussein or Iraq in a line, and they kept talking about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: You could use that as a blurb, like on your album. Kayem is — his CDs are explosive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Yeah. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: — DHS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: He’s the bomb. He’s the bomb.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: That’s like getting, you know, five mics on the source or something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Yeah, exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Anyway, sorry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>:  But anyway, I passed all that. Then once you get to the gate, they have to search you and interrogate you again. So you have to show up like five hours early, if they even print the boarding pass. But this time, I made it all the way to Detroit, which was just a connecting city. It wasn’t even where I was leaving from. And after I was already on the plane, they came up, asked for my ID, and then they told me that I had to get off, and no explanation, no refund, nothing like that, just left stranded. Luckily, I have friends everywhere, so somebody came and picked me up. The first friend, though, didn’t come back and pick me up. He was really scared. He’s like, “No, you gotta figure out what the hell’s going on. I’m not going over there.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Just to put this in context for people, on the one hand, we have this Muslim ban. And Trump — you know, now they’ve kind of repackaged it, and they’ve taken Iraq out of it. But that primarily was in response to the very selective outrage aimed at the fact that you had Iraqis who had worked as translators or collaborators with the United States military in Iraq. Because John McCain and others raised a ruckus about it, they said, “Okay, well, we’re gonna take Iraq off of this.” But they still have these six countries. So that’s one part of the policy. You, however, were born in the United States, so there’s a whole sort of different related reality. And that is that Muslims, Arabs, wide swaths of communities of color are being profiled and targeted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: One of the documents that we published that we got from a whistleblower on the watchlisting program showed that the number two city in the United States where people are on the watchlist is Dearborn, Michigan, where —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Makes sense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Which has the largest percentage of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans as a community in the entire United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The other four cities on that top five list were, you know, Chicago, New York, LA and then Dearborn, Michigan, you know, this small community. And I think there was something like 48,000 residents of Dearborn, Michigan, are on some form of the watchlist. And for people who say, “Well, you know, this is for our safety, and secondary screening is the best way to prevent terrorism,” they need to look at what happens if it’s taken to the extreme. Maher Arar, who is a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, was kidnapped at JFK Airport in 2002. This is, you know, an engineer, a very well educated, law-abiding, upstanding citizen in Canada. He’s coming back from a family vacation. His wife and kids are still on vacation. He’s coming back to go to work. He was working for an American company. He is in transit at JFK. He gets taken in the same way that you’re taken to a secondary screening, and ends up being rendered by the CIA and sent to Syria, a country he hadn’t been in since he was a little kid. And then was mercilessly tortured in Syria at the direction of the CIA. And he was kept in what, he called, his coffin. He was kept in a small box in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For 10 months and 10 days, he was kept inside of this coffin and interrogated about where is Osama bin Laden? Who are your other contacts within al-Qaeda? And it turns out that it was entirely a case of mistaken identity, that he had co-signed a loan for a guy, another guy in Canada, whose name was similar to someone that the CIA was tracking as an associate of some people high up in al-Qaeda. Both he and his friend were in boxes in Syria. Both of them: cases of mistaken identity. I bring that up because the stakes are very high. It’s not just a matter of, oh, we have to take off our shoes and our belts, and this is how we stay safe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: They target people because they’re Muslims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And we need to be clear in how we talk about that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: And it’s not just — you know, it wasn’t just the flight issues. Like people don’t understand. I was having the FBI perpetually coming to the house, like constant surveillance and harassment. And what they started doing — it got to a point where my lawyer was like, “Listen, just don’t take to them. Give ‘em my business card and have ‘em talk to me.” And when I would start doing that, they’d get really upset. And they started this tactic, which was, they would find some type of bogus warrant. I go through background checks for work or whatever. So some type of bogus warrant that didn’t exist a week ago, a traffic warrant, and they’d be like, “Oh, well, we have this traffic warrant. You have to come with us.” I would refuse to get in the car with them. I said, “If it’s a traffic warrant, call local police.” And of course, they’d make a big show of it. They wouldn’t call a regular squad car. They’d get a paddy wagon and bring it to my little court and make a big showoff for the neighbors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I’d have to go to jail. I’d go, four or five hours, get processed, and then they’d give me a court date the next day. I’d go the next day, and the judge would immediately just say, “Case dismissed.” And that was it. And it happened over and over. It was just like this intimidation tactic that, well, if you don’t talk to us, we’re gonna really inconvenience your life. And we’d be catching them at the grocery store and all around. It’s just no way to live, even if somebody can say, you know, “Oh, it wasn’t that bad. You didn’t go to Guantanamo. You didn’t do this.” But like, living under that constant anxiety and fear and worry that like — I was worried. I kept telling my friends like, “Yo, I don’t know what’s going on. If something happens and I’m in the news, I didn’t do it,” you know. Like I was prepared for, like, my name to be used for something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: My brother’s a lawyer. He calls that the Shaggy defense. “Wasn’t me.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: [Laughs] It wasn’t me. It really wasn’t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: All right, we got to — we’re gonna transition now to — we have Ed Snowden on the line from Moscow. But before we leave you, Kayem, share a few versus with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: Sure. I would say a lot of people that are familiar with my music know about the, like, more political or conscious content, and lot of subject matter’s heavy, so I just wanted to do something a bit lighter and fun. We can do that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: You have the right, man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: All right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, you — you’re gonna need to check it with SXSW.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: They’re gonna need to see all of your papers, and they’re gonna need to approve the lyrics — okay, I’m sorry, go ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>K\u003c/strong>: I don’t want to get deported back to Kentucky, man. All right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Kayem freestyle]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Cheering and applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: All right, give it up for Kayem. Support the work. There’s a documentary on him online, too, you should check out about his trip to Libya. And with that, we’re about to go to Moscow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Kayem, “Can’t Take Our Freedom”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the darkest hour when the world has turned away\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And no one’s watching when the sky has turned to grey and\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You have no options, when your voice is illegal\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Only choice for the people\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Is to stand up proudly in the face of death\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It ain’t a waste of breath when you speak up loudly\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On behalf of the kids in the street with no pot to piss in\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Living on they own ‘cause they papa’s missing\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Don’t know if he’s dead or he’s locked in the prison\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Disappeared, they consider him the opposition\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now I’m having visions of dreams I shouldn’t see\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like who would this close?

The NSA says everything it’s doing is perfectly legal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Edward Snowden [from news report]\u003c/strong>: I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the president, if I had a personal email.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Edward Snowden, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: [Laughs] Thank you. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: So, you are joining us now from a disclosed location in Moscow. And I wanted to start by asking you to clarify something that has been discussed in light of Trump, the documents that were released by WikiLeaks on CIA hacking. There are people who are saying, “Oh, it’s totally implausible that the NSA would have been intercepting or reading President Obama’s communications, or spying on members of Congress.” Based on your knowledge as a NSA contractor, and also someone who worked with the CIA, explain to people the realities of those capabilities, and whether or not the NSA would, in fact, collect data or communications on lawmakers, or even the president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: Yeah. So the main thing that this boils down to are word games. When people in government assert that the NSA would never collect communications on an American, any American, whether they’re a president, or a congressman, or whatever, without a warrant, they are lying. In the plain use of language, right, what “collects” means to you and me, right, that something travels across the phone line, that something travels across an internet line. They pick it up, they save it, and they drop it in their database. That happens to everyone right now. It does not matter whether you’re the president. It doesn’t matter whether you’re congress, it doesn’t matter whether you’re a judge, it doesn’t matter whether you’re an accountant, a lawyer. It doesn’t matter whether it’s you sitting in the room right now. These things happen by default. That’s how, of course, the system of surveillance works.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Because when you pick up the phone, right, there’s not a little flag associated with it that says, oh, this person’s the president, this person’s a congressman. You can manually go in and set up filters that say, you know, don’t collect on this number, that number, or whatever. But that’s not really how it works. On the backend, there’s a little bit of things like that. But what’s happening is these intelligence agencies, these lawyers at the DOJ for the president, they’re saying something different. They’re saying, to them, “collect” doesn’t mean that we copied your communications, that we put it in the bucket, and that we saved it, in case we want to look at it. To them, “collect” means that they take it out of the bucket and actually look at it and read it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, if you are an American citizen and they say, “I want to look at your communications. I want to listen to this person’s phone calls and everyone they contacted,” this in theory is supposed to require a warrant. But the actual reality here is that they can do something different, and they do do this without a warrant. But if you’re in that bucket and you don’t have a U.S. passport, you know, you’re not a U.S. citizen, no Social Security card. You don’t have a green card, so you’re not sort of legally privileged as a U.S. person, even if you’re not technically a U.S. citizen, they can’t, what they say, target you directly. But if they look at the other side of that communication, right? The communication that went overseas or involved a non-U.S. person in any way, that’s entirely legal. That happens without a warrant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And they don’t even have to be targeting a person, right? They don’t have to be going, “Oh, I want to know who this person was talking to on the other side in Pakistan. I’m gonna pull all their phone calls.” And oh, in there, it happens to be Jeremy Scahill. Or, oh, you know, I’m calling the Moscow Escort Service, or whatever. Donald Trump is their prime customer. So we get his phone call from there. No, no, no. It doesn’t require that. They can be targeting a machine. They can be targeting a server. They can be targeting a system. They can be targeting the desktop machine. Anywhere in the world, a router — and all of those communications that it’s passing, right, that include your communications, include my communications, that include people from Congress and the president just the same. All of those are in there, and they get displayed in response to the query.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, I did this professionally at Hawaii. This was my last position. I wasn’t interested, of course, in targeting U.S. politicians or U.S. persons at all. My assigned target, right, were Chinese intrusion sets. This is what we call sort of hackers, viruses, malware that are known to be associated with a certain group, right? But because it’s the internet, when I would look at these indicators of compromise, which is a way — sort of a technical term of ours of saying some computer got hacked somewhere. Maybe it’s at a defense contractor, right? Maybe it’s in a university, maybe it’s in a hospital. Maybe it’s at a congressman’s office, right? And it’s sending beacons that are meant for the hacker — they’re intended for the hacker — going out across the internet to this server that I know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I say, “I want to see everything that comes from that server.” Now when that comes back to me, right, it’s not just things that go to the hacker, right? It can be everything that goes to that server, which includes legitimate transactions because many times, these servers are themselves, hacked, right? We’re talking about a hot point. Because when somebody from China, or somebody from Russia, or somebody from the NSA hacks somebody else, they don’t go directly from their origin to their target because then it’s very easy to trace back, right? Instead, they create a network of hops across the internet that are ordinary people’s computers that don’t have very good security practices, right? Your grandma — your grandma’s computer could very well be being used in actual offensive cyber operations by nation states, if when you go and you internet — or you open sort of her internet browser, it’s got all those ancient advertising bars and things like that, and services that nobody uses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, my grandma’s computer contains some very offensive all caps emails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: Yeah, exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I hope she gets hacked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: If they’re forwarding chain letters and things like that, that’s an indication that they’re probably popped. But when we dial this back, right, what does this mean? If anybody at the NSA, if anybody at the FBI, wanted to review communications about President Obama, right? Like me, sitting at the NSA, I could do that simply by typing in an IP address that doesn’t even have to be the president’s IP address, right? Or if I want to search for his private email address or something like that, all I have to do is type it in the system, hit ‘enter,’ and say, “show me U.S. results for this.” This is entirely legal, so long as I’m not targeting him officially. So, I’m saying, I’m not interested in Obama, right? I’m interested in this known system that’s affiliated with Chinese cyber espionage or whatever, that just happens to be Obama’s Blackberry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Let me —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: And —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: I’m not doing what they call reverse targeting, which is where I admit that I’m doing this, I’m targeting this system because I want to read Obama’s emails, right? If I’m actually doing that, that happens all day long. People at NSA are doing that right now. This is legally prohibited. It’s called reverse targeting, right? But when you hit certain stop points in your investigation, you’re actually coached to do this kind of thing, where you say, we don’t know that this is Obama’s Blackberry, right? This is an unknown internet connected device. It happens to have some connection to a known foreign intelligence target, or a suspected foreign intelligence target. That doesn’t have to be saying, you know, Obama’s involved in espionage. That could just be saying that that device has been connected by a Russian malicious software scam, right? And as long as we say we weren’t intending to target him, he’s not the target of our investigation, and we didn’t know that it was Obama’s Blackberry, even if in reality, we actually did, it’s entirely legal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: So let’s pretend for a moment that we should always take Donald Trump’s statements seriously, and that we’re dealing with, like, a normal, rational, sane person. If indeed there is some merit to his allegation that he made on Twitter that the Obama administration — well, he said Obama personally — but the Obama administration was, in some form or another, targeting Trump or people around him, what would that look like?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: So, you know, this is where I don’t want to speak too far beyond what is actually known. I don’t want to get into the sort of craft of speculation here. Donald Trump has a well-established history of making unreliable statements. That’s not in debate, right? That’s not a point of contention.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think it is possible, based on everything we see and what we hear, there may be some indication that something like this happened on the backend, right? Where there’s been some searches that implicate not Donald Trump directly, right? Because if he had that, he’d be up on the stage waving it around on TV. But some third degree contact, something like that. It may not even be directly connected to the campaign, because this is what the NSA does, right? This is what you pay them to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Maybe one of these campaign officials actually had some contact with a Russian official, right, or somebody who’s a cutout, a go-between, right? But we have no evidence of that that’s publicly established, publicly known. And if Donald Trump or anybody else wants us to take this seriously, they have to show evidence. And the fact that they have not, despite the severity of this allegation, means that they’re trying to make political hay, I suspect, out of something that affects all of us, right? Which is the fact that mass surveillance is making all of us vulnerable. Had Obama wanted to read Donald Trump’s communications, the communications of anyone in his campaign, right, or anybody at the NSA had to, right, you don’t need the president’s authority for this. Any analyst with the proper authorities at the NSA, with the right clearances, who works with XKEYSCORE, right — that’s the name of our Google for spies that sorts through all of the things that you’re typing into on the internet and sending over the wire, or the SMS messages that you’re sending and the phone calls you’re making — could type in these numbers, type in these email addresses, and look at these things, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That’s the problem. It’s not so much that this actually happened here, there, or the other, because we don’t have evidence for that. If Donald Trump wants to take this seriously, right, he needs to fix the problem that everyone in America’s communications are being collected right now without a warrant, and then going into the bucket. And they’re protected by very lax internal policy regulations, right? And this simply is not enough. If he’s worried about the fact that somebody could have been wiretapping Trump Tower, that this could have happened without a warrant, or even with a warrant, right, the problem is not, oh, you know, poor Donald Trump. You’re the president, right? You should be asking questions about, “Why was this possible in the first place, and why haven’t I fixed it?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Right. And, you know, it sounds to me like you’re saying that Breitbart is not the best source of intelligence for the president of the United States, am I correct in saying this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I mean, this is a guy who clearly — I mean, he apparently doesn’t even, like, you know, want the full presidential daily briefing, but he damn sure makes sure to see Fox &amp; Friends every fucking morning, which on its own level is kind of frightening. But I wanted to ask you about this conversation about what’s being called, you know, the Deep State. And I don’t know how much American television news you consume in Russia, but MSNBC has basically transformed into a Cold War opponent of the Soviet Union. And they have, like, retired intelligence person after general after admiral on the air making totally unfounded claims about what has been proven. And the people who are sort of saying, “Hey, let’s see the evidence,” like me, or Glenn Greenwald, others — we’re called Russian agents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you, of course, have long been tarred with the allegation that you somehow are in cahoots with the FSB, or that you brought all these documents over to Russia, and that you now have been flipped into a Russian agent. Talk about — given that you’ve lived through this yourself — talk about your assessment, or give your assessment of the relationship between Russia and the United States, Trump and Russia, and the way that all of this is being covered in the news media.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: I’ll talk about this generally in the context of my case, right? So —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Are you an FSB agent?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: There are all of these crazy allegations. I’m sorry?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Are you an FSB agent?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: [Laughs] No, I’m not. But you know, maybe that’s a retirement plan. No, seriously though, that’s exactly the problem, is we’ve got these people who make allegations, right, about things that actually are relevant, things that actually should be investigated, but they’re not interested in the actual phase of investigation. I don’t want people to trust me. I want you to doubt me, right? I’m a former NSA guy, former CIA guy. I ended up in Russia through no fault of my own, right? I was actually trying to transit to Latin America, and the U.S. government revoked my passport to trap me in Russia, which is a fairly amazing thing that people don’t really understand that well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yeah, there were all these allegations some years ago where they went, “Look, this just doesn’t look right, right? So maybe we can paint him with the Russian spy brush because that’s something that doesn’t go away.” We’ve been seeing movies about Russian spies for, like, you know, since we were making movies. And there are Russian spies, right? That’s the thing. You don’t just brush this off as nothing. What you do is you look into it. What you do is you investigate it, right? And Congress did this to me. The intelligence community did this to me. The CIA, the NSA, all these guys, right? They saw me as public enemy number one, because I showed evidence that they were breaking the law. The federal courts ruled they were breaking the law, right? This isn’t an allegation. This is fact. They violated the rights of every man, woman, and child in the United States. But further than that, they violated the basic human rights of everyone in the world. The United Nations affirmed that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But so, here’s the thing. All that investigation went into me, right? Congress just released a report some months ago, which was criticized by every journalist who studied the issue, where the worst thing that they could show that I did — and this is with complete access to classified information, Congress being able to sit down with the Director of the CIA and say, “What’s actually happening with this guy?”—the worst thing that I ever did was that I lied to my boss about a sick day. I said, “Hey, guys, I’m going to the hospital,” when in reality, I was going to meet with journalists to tell them that the CIA and the NSA and all these groups were breaking the law, right? So the allegations fall apart if they’re not true after investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this gets back to a basic, fundamental point of logic, of rationality, that is supposed to be the foundation of sort of our national character, which is: That which can be presented without evidence, must be dismissed without consideration. Right? What we are supposed to be doing is calling for investigation. The allegations about Donald Trump are cause for concern. We can’t take them seriously because there’s no evidence backing them that we see publicly, right? But by all means, do we want the FBI to look into this? Yes, absolutely. Do we want the CIA to be investigating this? Yes, absolutely. And when we have evidence, we need to present it, because that’s how a system of law is supposed to work. People in the United States — you know, this is supposed to be a free country. We used to say that. We don’t say that so much anymore.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But if this is a free country, right, where people have the presumption of innocence, right — they’re innocent until proven guilty — by God, why are we saying the worst things about people imaginable without actually showing evidence of that? Now, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence at this point implicating that Donald Trump’s campaigns, the people around him, have causes for concern, right? So we should be digging into that. But passing this off as established fact is a real problem because it’s reducing our standards for evidence about things that actually happen. Saying I’m a Russian spy, right, when even the former Deputy Director of the NSA doesn’t say that is a problem. The guy who was in charge of my investigation, right? For people who are like, “Edward Snowden’s a Russian spy,” let’s go to the former Deputy Director of the National Security Agency, Chris Inglis, who is the guy who actually investigated me, and see what he thinks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chris Inglis\u003c/strong>: First, I have to point out that I don’t represent the United States government, anymore. I’m no longer in an official capacity, and so I wouldn’t know what the official position of the U.S. government is any more than I would know the absolute truth of what Snowden’s thinking was and all the machinations that he went through to do what he did. But here’s what I surmise, based on a careful observation of the facts available to me. It does seem clear that his intention was to go to Latin or South America after he revealed all this material in Hong Kong. He worked very hard and his lawyers worked very hard on his behalf to actually achieve that in the days and weeks afterwards. It doesn’t seem to me that a destination of China or Russia would be preferred. This was something that was done on the fly. It wasn’t carefully thought through.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I can’t imagine that his Plan A was to arrive in Moscow and essentially be in virtual isolation in a foreign country. Probably is a nice enough place to be, but it’s not home. And so I don’t think that he was in the employ of the Chinese or the Russians. I don’t see any evidence that would indicate that. And even if they’re careful in terms of practicing denial and deception, I think there would be certain telltales in there that would work out more crisply, more cleanly, separate and apart from where he’s wound up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Okay, well, clearly he’s a Russian agent; so let’s just dismiss everything he just said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The relevance of that, though — I mean, just to put it in context for people. I mean, this was a former very senior official at the NSA saying —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: The number two, yeah. Sorry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: The number two at the NSA, who — he doesn’t say it directly, but he’s referencing what you mentioned before, which is that you didn’t choose Russia. The Obama administration chose Russia by canceling your passport, and at one point, forcing Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia — forcing his plane to make an unplanned landing, a forced landing, because they suspected you might have been onboard this aircraft. I think that’s one of the greatest lies that’s been told about your case, is this idea that you chose to go to Russia, that you intended to make a deal with Moscow. And it sticks. You hear it constantly, “Edward Snowden is a Russian spy. He now has become an asset of the Russian government.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: Well, the funny thing is, you don’t actually hear this from serious people anymore. You hear this from sort of the crazy hyper-partisans. I have sort of formal affiliations with U.S. universities. I’m invited to speak at them regularly. Nobody has any legal trouble. Nobody gets — there’s no harassment or concern about this. Because serious people who actually look at this, they see that this is well-established fact, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Wait. You’re saying that that guy who got caught sending dick pics who was an NSA guy, that he’s not a serious person?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: [Laughs] I’m not gonna speak about any individual —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Okay, sorry. I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: In particular.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: I don’t mean to force you to respond to someone’s dick pics. I’m sorry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: The only people who are making these kind of allegations today are either sort of — and I say this with sympathy and compassion rather than reprisal — people who are seriously struggling with issues like senility, or people whose judgment is otherwise fairly well established as compromised, right? When you have, for example, Geoffrey Stone, who was part of the Obama commission to investigate what the NSA was doing, inviting me to debates, right, about the lawfulness of these programs, and they’re not saying, like, you were a Russian spy, or anything like that — the reason I’m even on the stage with these people is because they have affirmed that that’s not the case, right? If the [laughs] number two of the NSA is like, ”Look, there’s nothing to see here.” The number of times that I agree with the top leadership at the NSA in today’s world are very few. So if we’re speaking from the same page, there’s probably a reason for it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Let me ask you about the Deep State issue. There seems to be an emerging consensus among influential liberal pundits and political figures, politicians, and the Democratic Party, that there’s this awesome group of heroic NSA/CIA/military people that are protecting the republic from Donald Trump. What do you make of that narrative, that the Deep State is, A) trying to undermine Donald Trump, and B) is really in secret protecting all of us from the dangers of his administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: Well, it’s half true. And I mean, I don’t like to say these things are right or wrong because it’s not black and white. There is a Deep State, right? What are we saying when we talk about deep state? We’re talking about the people who survive presidents, right? These are not political appointees who come and go in this office or that office. They’re the people who are senior enough to influence policy, to shape the government’s understanding of an issue. And all the little people under them who are just sort of the worker bees who actually do things, these worker bees, by and large, are good people, right? I worked at NSA, at CIA, for a long time. I strongly disagree with a lot of their policies, right? They cause harm. They violate rights. They make us, the United States, less safe as a nation, and they destabilize peace, not just here at home, but around the world, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That’s not to say everything they do is bad, right? These worker bees, right, they’re good people who do bad things for what they consider to be good reasons, right? There are literally people in the United States who ran torture programs, and there are people who actually did the torture. I’m not saying these are good people, right? These are war crimes, uncontroversially. And these people probably did know at the time. But why did they do it, right? They did it because they were told there’d be blood on their hands or everybody else’s hands, that people were gonna die or buildings were gonna collapse, if it wasn’t done. Now I’m not saying that was the right thing to do. But who are the people who bear the most responsibility for this, right? That’s where you find the Deep State. It’s not the guy at the desk. The guy at the desk doesn’t even pick what he’s going to do that day. He’s ordered to do this, that, or the other. Follow the chain up, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you go to the White House, when you go one level down to the political appointees, and then you go that one step down, right? Political appointees who survive beyond presidents, and the people who sort of convert — they roll over from being a political appointee to embed themselves in the government on a permanent basis. That’s where you see the Deep State. And these are the people who are writing the memos that become our laws. These are the people who create the findings and suggestions that say, you know what? Torture would work. Torture would save lives. Even though, in fact, it didn’t. And it actually gave al Qaeda and ISIS their greatest propaganda boost that we ever provided them, because they could say, “Look, the United States is no better than us. Yes, we chop heads off. Yes, we drill holes in hands. But you know what? They do too.” Now, of course, we aren’t actually beheading people, but we are dousing people in cold water and letting them freeze to death in a cell after we’ve beaten them all day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We had people who had hummus in their food actually anally inserted. These people were raped with their dinner as a punishment for noncompliance or noncooperation. We can say many things. We can talk about moments of passion. We can talk about the loss of rationality in moments of panic. But these are fundamentally un-American things. And if there’s one thing, right, one thing we need to remember, it’s that these people have never faced the inside of a courtroom in a criminal trial. George Bush, right, who is sort of the architect of all of these programs and authorities — he’s the one who actually gave all these Deep Staters the legitimacy to construct and carry these things out. This could not have happened without his support — is now being rehabilitated in the public eye now. They’re saying, “Oh, he’s this wonderful, happy little painter guy. He’s like Bob Ross with an accent.” No, he’s not. He’s a war criminal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: [Laughs] You know, he’s just — he’s painting his own world, man. He’s just, you know, pretty little clouds. He can make it whatever he wants. No, it’s disgusting that, well, first of all, you have the kind of, you know, True Detective season three with Bush and Michelle Obama getting all cuddly and hugging. This was a guy who was responsible for wars that killed upwards of a million people, and including thousands of U.S. soldiers. And he now is being presented as like, he’s the reasonable Republican because Trump is so, you know, unfathomably dangerous. And I think it’s a disgrace to the soldiers who died, but also the civilians whose lives were treated as just dirt to step on around the world. And it really is a sick part of our —the amnesia that’s drilled into our culture of history, of the context of how we actually ended up where we are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I want to close by asking a couple questions about the recent CIA releases from WikiLeaks. Just to put it in context for people, the Vault Seven releases are — it’s about 8,700 or so documents or files that deal with the CIA’s hacking capabilities. And one of the things that’s gotten a lot of attention is the idea that — or the platform that allows a particular Samsung TV to be turned into a kind of in-home surveillance device. And, you know, a lot of people now are becoming aware of what’s called the Internet of Things. You know, you’ve got — your refrigerator is hooked up to the internet. You’ve got that damn Alexis, or Siri, or, you know, Go Google, or whatever it’s called. I know you, very early when this came out, said that this was extraordinarily significant. What, to you, given your expertise and your background — what are the biggest takeaways from what has been released so far, and what do you think is important for people to understand about what’s contained in these CIA documents?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: Yeah. I mean there’s a lot to talk about here. The thing that I don’t like that I’m not so impressed by is everybody’s talking about, you know, Samsung TVs. Nobody really cares about these Samsung TVs, in terms of what this means for our future. Any device that’s connected to the internet can be hacked, right? And this Samsung TV, in this circumstance, is not hacked through the internet. This is a USB-enabled hack, right, where somebody has to — this is an old version of TV, by the way. They had to go in and actually stick a USB drive in and start the TV up, and that would hack the TV. Then you pull the USB drive out, and the TV starts listening in on you. And people go, “Oh, well, the CIA’s not gonna be breaking into my house, right?” And that’s actually true. That’s me. Don’t panic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But they don’t go into your house, right? What they do is they wait for when these devices are being shipped to you, when you order them on Amazon or whatever. They go to them at the airports. They get the box. They use a little hair dryer to soften the adhesive. They open up the box. Then they put the USB stick in. They seal the box back all nice and perfect, and then they ship it on to you. And now your router, your computer, your TV is hacked. This is a very routine thing that happens, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Wait, so you’re saying that — wait, just —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: And it’s not typically the CIA that’s doing the hands-on on this, by the way. That’s the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Just to clarify. So you’re — and I know that there are documents that were made public because of you that show that they’re intercepting routers and other devices in bulk, right? And like, for instance, some of the exports from the United States that deal with internet technology and are going overseas, they’ll actually contaminate those devices without necessarily knowing what specific person’s going to get them. They’re contaminating at the source before they’re shipped.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: Sort of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Yes. This is a question, not a statement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES\u003c/strong>: It’s not just en masse, indiscriminately for everything, right? It’s not like every iPhone that gets sent to China is back-doored. If they know there’s a particular zip code or a particular region that has, like, a nuclear facility in it, they’ll do this kind of thing. And that would be appropriate, in many cases. You would want them to do that. But this is a method, right, that they apply to many different things, where they’ll also do this to political parties, right? They might also do this to a newsroom, if they see the device is going to a particular building, or whatever. These are the kind of causes for concern. Scope out from the individual thing of how does this affect me? Think about how does this affect society, right? And this is what the real value of this CIA release is about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The most important thing here is that we now have concrete evidence that the CIA, the NSA, the United States government, writ large, and our partners in places like the United Kingdom, are supporting a commercial market in making every internet-connected device less secure. They are paying companies to develop what are basically digital weapons or tools, like burglary tools, that will break into any device, right? And then when they create these things, the problem is, anybody can use them, right? You don’t just have to have the tool if you can rediscover the same kind of thing, which studies just came out in the last week showing the frequency of this, by the way, for any given tool, is five to 20 percent per year, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Five percent if you believe the sort of a not very reliable RAND study from a closed dataset. No academics are allowed to look at it. No universities are allowed to look at it. They just say, “Trust us. These numbers say what they think they are.” They say, “There’s a five percent chance every year that when the government uses a new kind of wiretap capability, the Russians, the Chinese, random hackers, whoever, will rediscover it and can use it to listen to American iPhones,” right, or Samsung TVs in the United States. Whatever the device of the day happens to be. Or 20 percent every year. That’s insane, right? It is — this doesn’t happen in any other industry. If every time you bought a hamburger, there was a five percent chance that it would kill you, people wouldn’t be eating hamburgers anymore until they changed the law. This is the dynamic that we really see in this release, and that’s the thing that people are focusing the least on, outside of policy circles now, because it’s not very exciting, it’s not very accessible, it’s not very easy to understand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But this largely misses, I think, the top-level point, when we think about all of this stuff. And this dynamic of Donald Trump, the fact that the world is on fire, the fact that the president’s statements can’t be relied upon, the fact that his laws are violating our Constitution in such a blatant and open manner, right, is that this is actually not new. What’s different is he is so inept that we see it, right? Even his representatives go on the news, and they don’t try to lie carefully. They don’t try to lie in a manner that has a kind of art to it. They do so openly without shame because they say, “What are you going to do to stop us?” But this happened in the Bush administration. He created a warrantless wiretapping program that, on its face, violated the Fourth Amendment so badly, so boldly, that the attorney general of the United States, at one point, refused to sign it because he didn’t think he could defend that if he was eventually brought into the docket one day. What did the president do? Well, he didn’t go, “All right, well, the attorney general says this isn’t legal. We shouldn’t do it.” He turned to the NSA director and said, “Well, the attorney general won’t sign off on this. Will you do this anyway?” And the director of the National Security Agency said, “Well, the president’s asking me. Sure.” Even though he knew that was a violation of the Constitution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let’s go to President Barack Obama, right? This is a similar thing. Obama was a fairly progressive, fairly liberal politician by American standards. And I don’t mean on the American political spectrum, because he was actually pretty far right, as far as, what people would consider to be a liberal. He was the one who said, “The world is a global battlefield. I’m going to assassinate U.S. citizens without a trial outside of an actual combat zone because I believe they’re a threat to the United States.” Now right or wrong, whether you think he was justified or unjustified in that, that’s unprecedented, and that’s clearly a violation of due process, right? But this happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you look at the statements of journalists who worked under the Obama administration — and we’re talking mainstream people, right? They’re describing his activities against the press as a war on whistleblowers, a war against the press. Whenever something comes to the public eye — cyber operations that are questionable, things that failed — he starts trying to put people in jail. The editor of the New York Times, right — this is not what we would consider sort of a radical fringe source — said the Obama White House was the most secretive they’ve ever dealt with. James Risen, who the DOJ for some time threatened with jail if he wouldn’t reveal who his source was, said Obama was the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, what does this all boil down to? Why does this matter? The reality is, all governments lie. All governments break the law. And most frequently, this happens without us realizing it. The majority of us, right? People who follow this, people who study this will see it. They’ll complain, they’ll protest, but they don’t have critical mass because they don’t have control of the airwaves. They’re sort of shuttled off in the corner of the room where they talk amongst each other. But the average person doesn’t care that much because these presidencies, these administrations, give them the space to deny it to themselves, right? To say, “I can go on with my day. I can go on with my life, and I don’t have to confront these issues. I can live in my comfortable life, I can go home after a hard day, right? I’ve got people to take care of. I’ve got bills to pay. I have obligations. I don’t have time to save the government, right?” We can’t do that anymore. That is no longer a luxury. And that, more than anything else, may be the silver lining of this disastrous administration, is the fact that people are, for the first time in a generation, realizing that democracy is not an inheritance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Folks, this is a challenge. This is our challenge. This is something that requires effort. This is something that requires sacrifice. And this is something that, if you turn your back on, will not get better. It will get worse. It is not enough to believe in something. It is not enough to think that America is the land of the free, the home of the brave — we have constitutional values, and these things will simply work out. They will mean nothing unless you make them mean something. It is not enough to believe in something, ladies and gentlemen. You must stand for something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Well, Edward Snowden, on that note, we’re gonna leave it there, and thank you so much for your work, your courage, your bravery, and your sometimes funny and always sharp analysis.

But his administration is pouring gasoline on several initiated by his predecessors. This week on Intercepted: There are U.S. boots on the ground in Syria — now including conventional military forces — and more are reportedly on the way. Trump has eased restrictions on the killing of civilians and is pummeling Yemen with drone strikes. Combined with the presence of radical ideologues in the White House and the involvement of the powerful militaries of Iran and Russia in the same battlespaces as the U.S., Trump could take the world to the brink of the unthinkable. We speak with veteran war correspondents Anand Gopal and Iona Craig, both of whom have been on the ground in U.S. wars under Trump. Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald talks about FBI Director James Comey’s testimony on Capitol Hill, the threats to jail journalists, and he reveals new evidence debunking one of the most insidious lies told about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Also, did you know that the NSA has its own classified, internal newspaper? Actor William Camp stars in the real-life story of the spy whose secret column made him “the Socrates of the NSA.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka:\u003c/strong> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J.

I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City, and this is episode nine of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> The news is not honest, much of the news. It’s not honest. And when I have close to a hundred million people watching me on Twitter, including Facebook, including all of the — Instagram, including POTUS, including lots of things. But we have, you know, I guess, pretty close to a hundred million people. I have my own form of media.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Well, the past few days have brought a whirlwind of controversies, and they’ve managed to make Donald Trump and his poorly oiled political machine look even more rickety than last week. And that’s quite an accomplishment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Send a good picture back to Germany, please, make sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Angela Merkel:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> First, we had Trump meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He pretended that he couldn’t hear her when she asked him for a handshake as they were sitting together in the White House. Remember, this is a guy who has like 19-second to two-minute handshakes with various people, and he all of a sudden couldn’t hear a word that Angela Merkel was saying when she asked for his hand. Trump then attempted to be funny and clever at their joint press conference by comparing his apparently totally fake allegation, his totally baseless allegation that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama to the very real fact that the NSA did, in fact, spy on Angela Merkel’s phone. And we know that from the documents of NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn’t make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Trump’s administration — if sort of insulting Germany wasn’t enough, the Trump administration also promoted the claim that the British equivalent of the NSA, the GCHQ, they were the ones that spied on Trump Tower on orders from the Obama administration. That in turn prompted GCHQ itself to issue an extraordinary statement calling Donald Trump’s allegation, “nonsense and totally ridiculous.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS\u003c/strong>: Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn’t use the NSA. He didn’t use the CIA. He didn’t use the FBI, and he didn’t use the Department of Justice. He used GCHQ. What is that? It’s the initials for the British intelligence-spying agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Then we had FBI Director James Comey head up to Capitol Hill to testify in front of Congress. And during his testimony, he confirmed that there is in fact an open FBI investigation into whether members of Trump’s campaign did in fact collude with Russia to influence the election. The NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers was there with James Comey, and he said that he agreed with GCHQ’s rejection of the tapping claims and said that they have no evidence that anything like that took place.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Jim Himes:\u003c/strong> So thanks to the modern technology that’s in front of me right here, I’ve got a tweet from the president an hour ago saying, “The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process.” So that’s not quite accurate, that tweet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> I’m sorry. I haven’t been following anybody on Twitter while I’ve been sitting here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JH:\u003c/strong> I can read it to you. It says, “The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral — the electoral process.” This tweet has gone out to millions of Americans — 16.1 million, to be exact. Is that accurate?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it’s really important that we not lose sight of the fact that there is a tremendous amount of hysterics, a lot of theories, a lot of premature conclusions being drawn around all of this Russia stuff. And there’s not a lot of hard evidence to back it up. There may be evidence, but it’s not here yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss this, I’m joined by my colleague, Glenn Greenwald, who is my fellow co-founder of The Intercept. Glenn, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald:\u003c/strong> It’s great to be back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your response to Comey’s statement and the media coverage of it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> So, everyone treated this like it was some kind of a bombshell, which was very strange, because I think everybody assumed that the FBI was already investigating this. And in fact, there had been an endless number of leaks saying that the FBI was actively investigating the question of collusion. So, I think I agree with our former colleague now at Rolling Stone, Matt Taibbi, who said that essentially, Comey and Rogers spent eight hours saying virtually nothing. On the other hand, it obviously is significant and newsworthy for the director of the FBI to acknowledge openly before the Congress that the FBI is actively investigating what appears to be the president and certainly the closest associates of the president, not on some banal corruption matter, but on the question of whether he actually conspired with a foreign adversary to win the election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Comey was joined by Admiral Mike Rogers, who is the director of the National Security Agency, and Rogers, in his testimony, Glenn, echoed the denial of the British intelligence service, the GCHQ, that Trump had been wiretapped or surveilled, or that Trump Tower had been targeted in that way. Given that you’ve spent years now researching and documenting the NSA and the GCHQ, what’s your assessment of this whole story and where it stands right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Oh, it was totally obvious from the very start that Trump was speaking out of his ass and that there was no basis for it whatsoever. He was just sitting, like he seems always to be doing, in front of Fox News. I swear, I mean, like you — I think the average person, if you could pick them out of the phonebook, has less TV time than Donald Trump. I mean he really does seem to spend the vast majority of his time watching cable news. And he heard from Judge Napolitano on Fox News that someone had told him that the wiretapping was effectuated by having the U.S. ask GCHQ to do it. I certainly don’t say that it’s implausible, at all, that the U.S. circumvents legal restrictions by getting GCHQ to do its dirty work for it. In fact, I regard GCHQ as by far the most abusive and invasive intelligence service in the West. But there just seems to be zero indication in this case that it actually happened, and I would be extremely surprised if someone like Obama or anyone associated with Obama was willing to do something so easily detectable and so obviously corrupt. It just seemed like one of those things Trump spit out from his mouth after watching Fox.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to shift gears and ask you, though, about the way that the kind of Russia hype has been built up by many news organizations and prominent Democratic pundits and Democratic politicians. But it seems as though, taking that in combination with Comey, that this could well result in the fact that someone like a Carter Page, or a Paul Manafort, or a General Flynn, that they may actually be under investigation. That they may have done something that’s either criminal or, you know, wildly against protocols in the United States, and it may not end up with any direct connection to Trump and Putin or the kind of narrative that’s been offered and seems to be kind of the dominant one now on Capitol Hill among the Democrats. To me, it seems like they’re setting themselves up by really amping this up and putting the whole — every allegation on steroids. When the facts actually come out, it’s gonna be incredibly underwhelming, and it’s gonna undercut their own credibility, unless they just keep doubling down on it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> It actually reminds me of what the Republicans did with Benghazi, where there was like a kernel of valid questions that needed systematic investigation and answers, which we never really actually quite got, about why they came out so quickly and made claims that were in their interest that turned out to be false about what motivated those killings. But the Republicans so wildly overplayed their hand and turned it into this unprecedented scandal, and went in so many wild different directions, that all their flailing and accusations that were without evidence and way premature in and just overzealous in terms of what they thought this was gonna accomplish completely destroyed the credibility of what, were actually, some valid and legitimate questions. Of course, there’s valid and legitimate questions when your ambassador is killed, and then the government makes false claims, wittingly or not, about what happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In this case, it’s actually even more serious because there are — there was a hack of the DNC and of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief that did have the potential to affect the outcome of the election. We’ll never know what effect it did have, or if it had any effect, but it’s possible it did. And it’s very possible that the Russians were behind it, although we still haven’t seen any evidence for it. That, of course, ought to be seriously investigated. And then the same with the question of whether the Trump campaign, any member of it, colluded with them. And I do think that there are some really sleazy, slimy people in Trump world, like Carter Page and Paul Manafort and lots of others like that, who may end up having their illegalities uncovered, that are tangential to these core questions as a result of the investigation that has now been triggered.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But as we said earlier, there seems to be no evidence that there’s evidence of collusion. James Clapper has said that. Mike Morrell, Hillary Clinton’s CIA surrogate, has said that. But the investigation should play out. The problem is that Democrats are so insane with the conspiracy theories that they embrace with no evidence — of the way their media leaders like Rachel Maddow and other people on MSNBC, who look and speak like Glenn Beck at his chalkboard in 2010, frantically connecting dots and coming up with these wild sprawling theories — that they really discredited the entire operation. To say nothing of how they routinely call journalists and politicians, or anybody who questions the claims they’re making, calls them “Putin spies, and on the payroll of the Kremlin,” and just the most insane, insidious, xenophobic, jingoistic kind of craziness that is driving them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Speaking of the Benghazi thing, at the Comey hearing, Rep. Trey Gowdy, who is, you know, one of the most reprehensible of the reprehensible Republicans on the Hill, when he was questioning Comey, he suggested or seemed to suggest that reporters should face federal prosecution for publishing classified information, which means that he would want you in jail, and me in jail, and a lot of other journalists in jail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> The climate that exists in Washington, whereby leakers are punished, is not an invention of Donald Trump or Trey Gowdy. This is the prevailing mentality that has existed for decades, but was particularly intensified over the last eight years under the Obama administration, which, as we all know, prosecuted more leakers and whistleblowers under the Espionage Act of 1917 than all prior administrations combined — in fact, almost triple the number. But the other point is, there is a statute that governs the leaking of classified information, of criminal law. And usually, it’s not a crime under the law to publish classified information if you’re a journalist. It’s only a crime if you’re an employee of the federal government to provide classified information to someone not authorized to receive it. So, usually, the leaker, such as Edward Snowden, or Chelsea Manning, are the ones committing the crimes. But the journalists, such as myself, or WikiLeaks, or the New York Times, or The Guardian, or whomever publishing it, is not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But there’s a very narrow range of leaks where the law actually does say that it’s a felony not just to leak but to publish, meaning the journalists are committing a crime. And one of those narrow categories is the content of interceptions that the NSA or the CIA collects while spying on a foreign government. So if they’re spying on Russia, they’re eavesdropping on the call of the Russian ambassador, they listen into the Russian ambassador talking to Michael Flynn, or Donald Trump, or whomever, and then anyone who leaks that is guilty of a crime, but also anyone who publishes it is guilty of a crime, a felony. And so, there is a law that says that that makes journalism a crime. The reason the government can’t punish journalists, hopefully, not withstanding that law, is because the First Amendment guarantees a free press, and the freedom of the press clause should bar the government from prosecuting journalists for reporting. But that has never been tested.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The official position of the U.S. government is that journalists are not exempt from those laws. And so, we do have this very dangerous law in the book that was used to threaten us during the Snowden reporting, and is now again being used to threaten whosever leaking about Michael Flynn, and Donald Trump, and the Trump White House, that is a serious law that we should repeal in order to prevent the Trey Gowdys of the world from trying to criminalize journalism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The story that you published this week at The Intercept about Edward Snowden — just to give people context here, there’s been this recurring line about Edward Snowden, that he spent 11 days in Hong Kong before actually meeting with you and Laura Poitras. And it’s been repeated by many news organizations and some prominent opponents of Snowden as evidence that he was meeting, potentially, with Chinese and Russian spies to work out his deal with them, and then he met you and Laura and Ewen MacAskill, and then he went to Moscow. Talk about what you found and what this is all about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, I’ve had to watch for three years while mainstream news outlets make a claim that I knew to be an absolute lie, which is that: Snowden wasn’t in this hotel until June 1\u003csup>st\u003c/sup>, not May 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup>, as he claimed. And then they said, well, there’s 11 missing days that’s unaccounted for, which they used to imply something sinister had happened. And all along, I knew it was a lie, and it’s so frustrating to watch — when you have personal knowledge — mainstream journalistic outlets reporting something in authoritative tones that you know is totally false. And so, we had tried to get the documents for a while that showed that this is a lie. It was difficult to get them from the Mira Hotel. We didn’t really think it was worth it until this new book came out two months ago from this Wall Street Journal writer, Edward Jay Epstein, who based almost his whole book, at least in large part, on this lie. It got mainstreamed everywhere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so we finally got the records, which we published today, showing that he, in fact, checked into the hotel exactly when he said, on May 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup>. There were no 11 missing days. He was in the Mira the entire time waiting for myself and Laura, and ultimately Ewen MacAskill, to get there. And the whole thing was just a complete fabrication, a total fraud that got laundered and whitewashed and repeated over, and over, by extremely reckless journalists who, even now that the documents are published, still haven’t corrected or retracted anything that they’ve said. And so now, that’s the next step. But it just shows how often false claims get reported by even the most authoritative mainstream news outlets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Glenn, we’re gonna leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Good talking to you, Jeremy. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was my colleague Glenn Greenwald. You can read his columns and his journalism at theintercept.com.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, most people listening to this podcast have certainly heard of BuzzFeed or The Huffington Post or ProPublica, and I would hope you’ve heard of The Intercept. We are all online news organizations. But there’s an online newspaper that you probably have never heard of. It’s called SIDToday, which stands for Signals Intelligence Directorate Today. And the reason you’ve probably never heard of it is because SIDToday contains classified information, and it’s published by the National Security Agency. And it’s only available to NSA employees who have security clearances. Signals intelligence, SIGINT, is the NSA’s shorthand for the type of information that it collects by eavesdropping on electronic data across the world. SIDToday, like a lot of newspapers, even has its own columnists. And at the NSA, those columnists are regular agency staffers who wrote their columns in their spare time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There’s been a columnist on grammar, another on office etiquette, and there’s even been a columnist on the ethics of surveillance. These columns were among the documents leaked by Edward Snowden, and the Intercept has published a number of them. Now that brings us to the matter of this podcast. In 2012, the NSA named its new ethics columnist, whom the agency referred to as the “SIGINT philosopher, the Socrates of the NSA.” He was a language analyst who had gotten a master’s degree in Fine Arts, in creative writing, before joining the NSA. When the novel didn’t work out, he decided to become a spy. My Intercept colleague, the terrific journalist Peter Maass, wrote an in-depth \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/surveillance-philosopher-nsa/\">story about the SIGINT philosopher\u003c/a>, and you can read that story at theintercept.com. And Peter’s story included excerpts of the first and probably the most intriguing column that the SIGIIT philosopher wrote for the NSA’s internal newspaper. We asked the actor Bill Camp to perform this column for Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill Camp as SIGINT Philosopher:\u003c/strong> Since I’ve become the new SIGINT philosopher — a position whose very existence will undo the good work of generations of parents who wisely begged their children not to major in philosophy because they will starve — I suppose I should be clear what I mean by the term “philosophy.” It is one of those words that can have many different meanings, ranging all the way from Plato to corporate mission statements to any kind of folk wisdom:, e.g.:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Andrew: I can’t believe the Ravens blew that game.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chris: Well, some days you eat the bear, and some days, the bear eats you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Andrew: Wow, man. That’s deep. You’re so philosophical.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But to me, philosophy is useful only to the extent it can help you figure out what to do with your life. And since I am the SIGINT philosopher, in this column, I’ll try to talk about questions that are relevant to what we all do at work every day. Call it “applied philosophy with a SIGINT slant” with possible gratuitous insertions of Heidegger just to make me sound smart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One philosophical SIGINT conundrum that faces many of us SIGINTers is the feeling famously expressed by Herbert Hoover’s Secretary of State, Henry Stimson, that “gentlemen do not read other gentlemen’s mail.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While almost everyone would agree this is a hopelessly quixotic sentiment, and one doomed to be ignored by every nation on earth, I was surprised when I began working here to be assigned to a diplomatic target. Somehow, it didn’t sit well with me at first that we (the U.S.) would invest big money and effort into eavesdropping on the same people we negotiated with. It was as if with the right hand of our State Department we shook their hand, while with the left hand of the Defense Department, we reached into their coat pockets. Surely, I thought, if there were any place in the world that idealism should rule, and we should show voluntary restraint in our intelligence work, diplomacy was that place. Terrorists who meant harm to children and puppies were one thing, but civil servants talking about work while schlepping their kids to soccer practice seemed a little too close to home.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last year, I unwittingly stumbled across what feels to me like a good answer to this question during, of all things, my polygraph examination.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m a libertarian by nature. I like to be left alone. Polygraphs, to me, are a unique kind of torture. Like many analysts in SID, I also make them worse for myself by analyzing and obsessing each question to death. Last year, a day before my birthday, I had a really terrible polygraph that I knew I had not passed. I spent a month obsessing over it, wondering how I would find a new job and launching into long internal diatribes berating a society in which it is no longer possible for me to take my family in a wagon out to the prairie and claim a plot of land by a creek and live in a mud cabin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the many thoughts that continually went through my mind was that if I had to reveal part of my personal life to my employer, I’d really rather reveal all of it, rather than just a part of it. Partial revelation, such as the fact that answering question X made my pulse quicken, led to misunderstandings. I found myself wishing that my life would be constantly and completely monitored. It might seem odd that a self-professed libertarian would wish an Orwellian dystopia on himself, but here was my rationale: If people knew a few things about me, I might seem suspicious. But if people knew everything about me, they’d see they had nothing to fear.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is the attitude I have brought to SIGINT work since then. If we are going to work on targets that fall short of being technically “enemies” but are rather informative for our policymakers — and we are — then even looking at it from the target’s perspective, we are honor-bound to do more and better monitoring rather than less.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For while the U.S. does not truly have god-like powers — we cannot do all things —we do have extraordinary powers. And we tend to mistrust what we do not understand well. A target that has no ill will to the U.S., but which is being monitored, needs better and more monitoring, not less. So if we’re in for a penny, we need to be in for a pound. From the perspective of the U.S., obviously, it is in our interest to understand a target better. But even for the target (if we, like Stimson, are going to chivalrously concern ourselves for him) it is better to be completely and competently monitored, rather than halfheartedly and incompetently so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I guess, if we were a corporation, we could make our mission statement (or “corporate philosophy”) this: “building informed decision-makers — so that targets do not suffer our nation’s wrath unless they really deserve it — by exercising deity-like monitoring of the target.” Now that’s philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was actor Bill Camp performing a literal adaptation of the SIGINT philosopher, a columnist for the NSA’s classified internal newspaper, SIDToday.  Check out Peter Maass’ reporting on this at theintercept.com. Coming up on the show, Donald Trump hasn’t started any news wars — yet. But he is dousing gas on the ones initiated by his predecessors. Could he start World War III? We’ll talk to two of the best war reporters around. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, we’re back here with you now on Intercepted, and we turn now to the multiple wars the U.S. is currently engaged in across the globe. Now, we should be clear — Donald Trump did not start any of these wars. At present, they constitute a gruesome inheritance from Trump’s predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush. But as we clearly saw during the eight years of the Obama administration, just because a president doesn’t initiate a war doesn’t mean that they can’t escalate it. Obama did that with the drone war in Pakistan. He did it with the troop surge in Afghanistan. He did it at various times in Iraq. Obama also did in fact start some new wars, namely, the consistent drone bombings and cruise missile attacks in Yemen. He also escalated U.S. operations inside of Somalia. He authorized air strikes and Special Operations activity inside of Libya, and those actions helped actually overthrow the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. Obama also gave orders for the U.S. to act militarily in Syria and to reengage in Northern Iraq.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in recent weeks, President Trump has shown that he intends to escalate or intensify several of these wars. And he is initiating policies that are almost certainly going to result in many more civilians being killed. In Yemen, he declared certain parts of that country so-called “areas of active hostilities.” That allows U.S. military forces to operate with less restraints on the killing of civilians. That was in place before the Navy SEAL raid that Donald Trump authorized in Yemen, and it was in place when Trump broke Obama’s record with an incredible number of drone strikes over the course of just a few days inside of Yemen. In Syria, the U.S. now officially has conventional U.S. forces on the ground. There’s several hundred Marines. There’s reports that others are moving toward Kuwait and elsewhere in the region, and that we’re going to see more boots on the ground in Syria. And this is all in addition to the covert Special Forces or CIA forces that have already been on the ground inside of Syria. The U.S. is also exhibiting very fierce airpower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barbara Starr:\u003c/strong> This is something the Obama administration had always rejected. It’s a very high-risk idea. If you’re gonna put U.S. ground troops into Syria, you have to be able to protect them on the ground and from the air. It is a very risky idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But lingering over all of this is Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>James Mattis:\u003c/strong> As far as Iran goes, this is the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Defense Secretary James Mattis has been an ardent hawk on Iran. Iran is a country which the U.S. is now in a proxy war against in both Syria and increasingly in Yemen. And of course, there’s Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Wouldn’t it be a wonderful thing, frankly, if we actually got along with Russia and worked out some kind of a deal where we go in and knock the hell out of ISIS along with NATO?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Trump administration has tried to project this idea that what the U.S. is doing in Syria is targeting the same people that Russia is. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. We both want to kill ISIS, and that’s what’s at play there. But there are powerful elements within the U.S. national security and military apparatus in this country that believe Trump is sort of playing with fire in Syria because of Russia, because of Iran, particularly when you think of any potential endgame in Syria, and no one even talks about that. Is it gonna include Assad? Who’s gonna be in control? Who’s gonna govern it? Are the Russians going to remain? None of that. No one talks about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of this, combined with the radical right wing ideologues embedded throughout the Trump administration and their vile rhetoric about Muslims or about Islam in general, it raises the prospects of a catastrophic spreading of this wildfire in the Middle East that was started by both Democrats and Republicans. Russia and Iran are serious military powers. This is an incendiary situation. And given the way Trump is governing, it could quickly explode into something unthinkable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m joined now by two of the best war reporters in the world. Anand Gopal has spent more than a decade covering the U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, and elsewhere as an unembedded journalist reporting on the ground. His incredible book on Afghanistan is called “No Good Men Among the Living.” And I’m joined by Iona Craig. She is one of the most experienced and brave correspondents to cover the multiple wars, both civil and foreign, in Yemen. Iona has been reporting recently for The Intercept, and she just traveled to the village in Yemen where the January Navy SEAL raid that Trump authorized took place. And her story, which was titled “Women and Children Yemeni Village Recall Horror of Trump’s ‘Highly Successful’ SEAL Raid” — that story can be found at theintercept.com. I want to start with you, Anand Gopal. First of all, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Anand Gopal:\u003c/strong> Good to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Iona Craig, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Iona Craig:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, Anand, let’s begin with you. We’re not disclosing where you are in the world right now. What we will say is that for many years, you have been covering various U.S. wars on the ground, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc. And I just — I wanted to begin — I know that you recently were in Mosul, Iraq. Just describe what has been taking place on the ground in Iraq, particularly in Northern Iraq, over the past several months.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Well, there’s been this major offensive to retake the city of Mosul from ISIS, and it started back in October. And up till now, about half the city has been retaken by the Iraqi Army and backed by U.S. airpower, and that’s the east half of the city. And the west half is what’s being fought over right now, which is sort of densely packed neighborhoods. The Old City is there, and street by street fighting that’s happening at the moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what is the role of the United States on the ground right now in Iraq?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> There are American Special Forces on the ground, but much more important than that is U.S. airpower, without which the Iraqi forces probably would not be able to get very far. And they’ve been hitting pretty much everything in sight. And there’s been an extraordinary number of civilian casualties. Just kind of gone through the roof in the last couple of months, especially as the forces have moved into West Mosul, because like I said, these houses are really close together. And so, you can have a case where an ISIS sniper is on a house, and they’re — the Americans are dropping bombs on the house and killing everybody inside, including families that are cowering in the basement, people who are being shot on the street on sight. It’s a real humanitarian disaster that’s unfolding as we speak.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Have you seen a shift in the operational tempo or the tactics being used since Donald Trump became president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Not really. On the ground, it’s been pretty much — he’s been playing Obama’s playbook. And so, we’ve seen an increase in the number of civilian deaths, but that’s only because it’s more crowded on the West Side. But in Obama’s last few months before he left office, he himself seems to have increased the tempo, ‘cause I think he really wanted to have Mosul being recaptured before he left office. That was really his showpiece.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, this may sound like the most basic of questions, but I’m gonna ask it anyway because of your experience. What is the force that is just referred to as ISIS or ISIL? Who are these people that are on the ground in Iraq and Syria under the banner of ISIS?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s a mix of people. You know, the core of it, the leadership, is the group that was al Qaeda in Iraq that was fighting against the American occupation back 10 or 15 years ago. But then you also have all sorts of assorted people who have taken up arms because they see the Iraqi state as an oppressor. There’s a lot of ex-Ba’athists who are in the movement as well. It’s a bit of a hodgepodge, but yeah, the core group that’s fighting is the same group that the Americans were fighting back in 2005 and 2006.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As someone who’s spent a fair bit of time on the ground in Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s regime, you know, I’ve studied this particular dynamic quite carefully. And I want to put something out to you, and you tell me if I’m wrong, or what you think about it, or if you agree. It seems like some of the particularly early military capacity that the evolved ISIS — as in, you know, al Qaeda and Iraq becoming ISIS — they had as a result of working with former Ba’athist military people. And also, in those heavily Sunni areas that butt up against some of the Kurdish areas, the same people who are fighting now on the side of ISIS from the kind of Ba’athist stronghold communities, it’s a battle that they’ve been fighting before there was an ISIS. It’s —essentially, there are tribes that are controlling some of these areas. And it seems to me like part of what’s at play is that these guys got screwed by the Americans, you know, at the beginning of the invasion in 2003. Then they got screwed again with the awakening councils and the backing of Shi’ite militias, and then the movement of Iran increasingly into Iraq. Is part of this kind of “enemy of my enemy is my friend,” or strategic alliance on the part of some of the tribes and the former Ba’athists?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> That was definitely the case initially when ISIS came about in 2014. So you had really what was an alliance between, like you said, the various tribal groups, especially in Anbar, ex-Ba’athists and al Qaeda figures. And from their side of — point of view, that was really kind of a deal with the devil because ISIS basically devoured every group that allied with them until they became the sole power in any given place. But that’s definitely the root of it. I’ll give you an example. There’s a town that’s not far from Mosul called Tal Afar, which was a place that, during the American occupation, the U.S. really kind of divided and ruled. They gave all the posts to Shia Turkmen. They armed one side, one part of the community at the expense of the other part of the community. And so, unsurprisingly, that part of the community that lost out ended up joining the insurgency against the Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it’s largely from that same element of the community that the leadership of ISIS that’s in Mosul right now is fighting. So there’s a real continuity there, and it really draws back to sort of what the U.S. — the calamity the U.S. sort of set in motion beginning in 2003.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I want to shift to Syria. The big story right now — well, actually, not that big of a story in the United States — is this airstrike that the U.S. carried out last week in Syria. People on the ground are saying it killed dozens of civilians. The U.S. Central Command is saying that it killed dozens of al Qaeda fighters. And I’m not sure if you saw this, Anand, where you are, but the New York Times and its reporting on this on Monday said, “The United States also conducted an airstrike last week in Syria that the American military said killed dozens of Qaeda fighters, but that local activists hurt civilians.” They used the phrase “hurt civilians.” That’s apparently the New York Times’ new way of describing killing people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Well, what’s amazing there is that this is not like it’s hard to figure out what happened, because there are people on the ground who’ve been to the site who’ve, you know, shared pictures on social media. The U.S. tried to show that it didn’t hit a mosque by releasing photos and video of the strike. And then, of course, you can see from the strike and the facilities that it actually was the mosque that they hit. So, this isn’t a real secret. And in Syria, pretty much everybody who follows this knows that this is what happened. The question is, who were the people inside the mosque? And that’s still unclear, I think, up till now. But, you know, we’ve seen this again and again, where the Pentagon comes out and will say that they did not hit, you know, a hospital, or a school, or a mosque, and then in the face of overwhelming evidence, they begin to slowly walk it back. And oftentimes, peoples’ attentions turned away after the fact. This is the same thing that happened in Kunduz in Afghanistan with the hospital strike.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We now are seeing reports of a pretty significant buildup of American boots on the ground with more, it seems, coming down the pipeline. Talk about what the emerging U.S. strategy and presence looks like as we now know that there are not just Special Forces, but 82\u003csup>nd\u003c/sup> Airborne gearing up and some conventional units, I understand, also inside of Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Yeah, that’s right. And the conventional units are heading towards Raqqa, where the U.S. — Raqqa being the ISIS capital. And the U.S. is allying with the Kurdish forces, with the YPG, in the push towards Raqqa. And then if you look at the pattern of where the U.S. is deploying and where its airstrikes are actually hitting in Syria, what you see is the entire U.S. effort in Syria is to attack the enemies of Bashar al-Assad. You know, we tend to think that the U.S. has been supporting a regime change in Syria. But on the ground, that’s just not the case. In fact, the U.S. has really been avoiding doing anything to antagonize the Syrian regime, and instead has really been focusing its fire on ISIS or on other enemies of the Assad regime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wait, so you’re saying that not just the Obama policy of sort of going back and forth on whether it would be good for regional stability if Assad remained in power, but you’re saying that also on the ground, the U.S. military actions are effectively supporting Assad?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Well, yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, I’ll give an example. In Palmyra, which is a fight right now between Assad’s forces and ISIS, and the U.S. has been providing —giving airstrikes against ISIS. And so, the only forces on the ground there that they’re providing air cover for are Assad’s soldiers. There’s no FSA. There’s no other rebel groups there in Palmyra. And likewise, in other parts of the country, when they’re allying with the Kurdish forces, it’s again specifically to fight against ISIS. When rebel groups want to try to fight against the regime, the U.S. cuts off its funding or aid and insists that you have to fight against ISIS or you don’t get any money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And let’s remember that the Russians are deeply militarily engaged inside of Syria. And of course, they openly want Bashar al-Assad to remain in power, and they’re spending an enormous amount of money and killing a tremendous number of civilians. You also have Iranian influence, Hezbollah, Qatar, other — it’s a huge chessboard right now in Syria involving some major world powers, and then some sort of second-tier world powers. And on that, I want to shift to Yemen. And Iona Craig, you’ve been reporting on the role of the United States in Yemen, and you just came out of Yemen, where you visited the village that was the scene of this U.S. Navy SEAL raid that killed scores of women and children, as well as an American Navy SEAL. So, Iona Craig, talk about what’s happening on the ground in Yemen, what you’ve found in your recent investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> Well, yeah, I mean, if you go right back to the core of it, this is really a war that kind of dates back many years, but really, it’s a fight between two presidents. You’ve got the former president, and he’s now got the Houthis onside, so in effect, Iran is now on his side, and he is fighting the current president that is recognized by the West and America and the international community, who is President Hadi. And he is supported by the Saudi-led coalition who started this bombing campaign back in March 2015, although the fighting on the ground actually started long before that. So when this raid happened, it was in an area that was under the — well, “under the control” is a very loose term, really, but was on the side of the Saudi-led coalition. And yes, there is Al-Qaeda fighting in that area. There is Islamic state fighting in that area. But they’re fighting against the Houthis and the former President Saleh. So effectively, this raid was against people who were, in theory, at least, on the same side as the U.S. in this war in Yemen at the moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let’s remind people. This was the raid that Donald Trump authorized when he was having dinner with, you know, the rabid right-wing characters — Steven Bannon, his son-in-law Jared Kushner as well. And he’s, you know, chomping on his Trump steaks, and is like, “Oh yeah, let’s green-light this on the ground Commando raid inside of Yemen,” so that this thing happens. What did local people tell you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> Well, they were totally confused when this first happened. It happened, obviously, in the middle of the night. As we know, they chose a deliberately moonless night, so it was dark. And because of the war, they’d been fighting the Houthi-Saleh forces in that area since the end of 2014. They assumed their village was being raided by the Houthi-Saleh forces. So every man with a gun within hearing distance of a gunshot, or then later, the helicopters that joined in, came in to defend the village, totally unaware that it was Americans they were going up against. And so, what happened was, you’ve got a predominantly civilian population in a very remote village on the side of a mountain in Yemen, and the Navy SEALS got pinned down. And when they got pinned down, of course, they called in air support, and they strafed the entire village. So you had women and children quite literally running for their lives, who were then gunned down by helicopter gunship fire. You had airstrikes and drone strikes being carried out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what you looked at from when I got there, sort of 11 days later, was blind panic of trying to get the SEALs out once they’d got themselves stuck in a situation of being overwhelmed by local tribesmen who were defending their village. And there were a small number of low-level al Qaeda militants who were also staying in one house, it appeared, that was at the bottom of this village on a hill. And the Navy SEALs were coming from the lower ground, so they were already at a disadvantage because the men that were coming in to support the fight, the locals, were on the higher ground as well. So even before they went in there, it was gonna be a very dangerous operation anyway because they should have realized that everybody was gonna come to defend that village because it’s right near the frontlines of the civil war at the moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, the Trump administration and Trump himself, they continue to say that this raid was a success and that it yielded valuable intelligence. From your understanding, Iona, of the dynamics within al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, in Yemen, would the figures that were connected to al Qaeda that were supposedly, I guess, the bad guys that were being targeted, would they have had top-level operational details or information that would have been a kind of intelligence jackpot for the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> Certainly not. Not those guys that were supposedly there. The information was that they were going after Qasim al-Raymi as well. Now, even if Qasim al-Raymi was there, I doubt he would have been running around with either a laptop or external hard drive on him with loads of information, but —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Qasim al-Raymi is one of the leaders of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and has been “killed” several times, and the U.S. has — he’s definitely one of the top targets of AQAP that the U.S. would want to either kill or capture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, absolutely. He took over the leadership from Nasir al-Wuhayshi, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike a couple of years ago. And Qasim al-Raymi is now the new leader of AQAP. And the suggestion was that he was in the village. But according to the villagers, he certainly wasn’t. And the low-level guys that were there, no, they wouldn’t have done. And even if they did, the house that I mentioned that they were supposedly staying in ended up being droned and blown up before the SEALs could even get to it because of the fire that they were coming under. I even tried to sort of say to the villagers then, “Okay, which of the buildings below in the village did they get into?” And nobody could tell me whether they definitely did even get into a building or not, at all, and if they had access to perhaps any of the dead bodies to remove cell phones or whatever. So it’s not even clear that they did physically get into a house in order to be able to take anything that was in it. Certainly, the house that may have held anything in it, cell phones, laptop, or whatever, was destroyed before the Navy SEALs could even get inside.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And of course, we had then, about a month or so after that raid, Trump basically authorizing — well, it’s not even clear if he authorized — let’s just say the U.S. did more drone strikes in basically a month than occurred in the entire year of 2016, the last year of Obama’s presidency. Describe that period, then, where you just had drone strikes, after drone strike, after drone strike.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> It wasn’t even in the space of a month. It was in the space of 36 hours. They carried out as many strikes as they had done in the whole of last year. So it was across three provinces, one of which was where the village was. And they targeted the village again. They killed two more children, three more adults, some of whom I’d actually met when I was in the village. They saw it as revenge — as revenge for killing a Navy SEAL, basically — that the Americans were coming back to destroy their village entirely and to make sure that everybody was gone. Even, you know, if that may not be the case, that’s certainly how they view the U.S. at the moment. Also, because of the Civil War, a lot of them there saw it as a way of helping Ali Abdullah Saleh and the Houthis, of course.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this is the problem, that America is now at risk of being sucked into the very, you know, domestic political situation that’s going on in Yemen right now, and being seen as very much taking one side. Yes, they were already supporting the Saudi-led coalition, but now the people that were supposedly on their side, they now see them as helping their opponents. So, yeah, you know, it’s getting stuck into a very complicated mess in Yemen right now, that could get even worse, if now, the Trump administration decides to conflate the Houthis with Iran, which there have been, sort of, mentions of coming out of the White House — that that could be an even greater mess that America could be sucking itself into.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Anand, the issue of Iran, is one that is really simmering up to the top. You have General Mattis, who now is the Defense Secretary, the former CENTCOM commander, who by all accounts has for a long time been very eager to have a war with Iran. We now know that Trump is delegating authorities much further down the chain so that the Pentagon can greenlight a variety of operations and full-scale plans without needing the direct involvement of the commander-in-chief. I was recently talking to a career covert military officer who told me that he fears that part of what is at play here in Syria is, ultimately, that they want to march on Iran. Something which I find somewhat unfathomable, given that Iran has a real military. But this person, who spent his entire life doing covert operations, said that there are a lot of people within the military and intelligence community who do think that there are very powerful people now that intend to march through Syria and build up the force that would actually go to war with Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> I think in some quarters, there is certainly a fantasy of creating a Sunni force that would, at the very least, rid the U.S.’s reliance on Iranian forces, which is essentially what they had been relying on in Iraq, especially, but also really in Syria. And so, there’s this idea in some quarters that you can raise this — almost like a second awakening, and this would be your proxy force. How realistic that is, is another question, that I don’t think it is very realistic. I mean let’s take Iraq, for example: The anti-ISIS fight would not be happening without the cooperation of Iran. And so essentially, the U.S. cannot actually fight against ISIS without having, at the very least, a de facto alliance with Iran, and even so, in Syria. In fact, one of the reasons why the offensive is going a little slowly in Mosul is because a lot of the Iraqi Shia militias — the deadliest ones, let’s say — are actually in Syria. They were in Aleppo. They were fighting in Aleppo. They were in other parts of Syria. And so, it’s an extraordinarily complicated situation in which the U.S. and the Trump administration particularly is pretty anti-Iran. But at the same time, they have to rely on Iran if they want to fight ISIS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I have pressed that issue with people that are on the inside that keep saying, “No, you guys are missing the point, that this is real.” Like, these guys actually do want this, to the point where I actually — I’m kind of obsessed with this now because I’ve been told by so many knowledgeable people that that is the agenda, that I really am having trouble seeing what they would get out of it except a mass bloodbath. But it does seem like we’ve got some pretty insane people within this administration that have risen to positions of great power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, I wouldn’t put it past them. The thing to keep in mind, though, is that pursuing that would just lead to an even greater calamity than what we see right now. You know, already, it’s a bloodbath in the Middle East, and already, there’s hundreds of different forces fighting. And any attempt to try to either create a Sunni proxy force or to, you know, push on to Iran would just be an even greater disaster. And there, we’re talking like World War III-level disaster.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That’s a phrase I’ve been hearing. I mean, you’re speaking as a logical, well-informed person who cares about broader humanity, so you don’t belong in this conversation, really, Anand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Iona, I wanted to ask you — I think a lot of people don’t understand why the United States would be supporting what amounts to the utter decimation of Yemen in this merciless, kind of scorched earth, Saudi campaign — and also the reality, as you were describing: That the United States in several concrete ways is finding itself on the side of al Qaeda in Yemen, and simultaneously, trying to kill al Qaeda in Yemen. But what does the U.S. want out of this? Like, why support the just utter pummeling of Yemen?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s good business. In the first year of the war, the U.S. sold 20 billion dollars worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia has been buying more and more weapons as a result of this war. And the same goes for the British government as well. This is ultimately about money, really. And Saudi being an ally is obviously important, and it, you know, plays into this regional conflict that we’re already talking about between Saudi Arabia and Iran because the Saudis see the Houthis as an Iranian proxy. But really, it all boils down to financial gain. And that’s the greatest win, really, for the U.S. But it’s an extremely costly one, obviously, for the civilian population of Yemen. You’ve got 20 million people out of a population of 25 million in need of humanitarian aid now. It’s the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world. Because of the blockade that has been put on the country by the Saudi-led coalition, the country can’t import its food, and it relies on — 90 percent of its food comes from imports. At the same time, the Houthis have also been blocking access to food and to aid on the ground as well, so the two worst areas affected in Yemen by this looming famine are actually on both sides of the frontlines. So the civilians on both sides are getting completely screwed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But yeah, at this rate, the U.S. is liable to be owning a famine in Yemen, and along with the rest of the international community, as long as they keep supplying Saudi Arabia with not just the weapons as well, but the U.S. is obviously, you know, heavily involved in the refueling of aircraft, which are carrying out all of these air raids in Yemen. And certainly, without doing that, without the logistical support, if the Americans stopped doing that today, that refueling, the Saudis would have to stop bombing tomorrow, quite literally. So they have a huge influence over what Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen. But yeah, it all comes down to big business in the end.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Iona Craig, thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IC:\u003c/strong> Thanks a lot.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Anand Gopal, joining us from somewhere in the world, thank you so much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AG:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Iona Craig is a veteran war correspondent who has spent many years covering the situation, the wars, the bombings in Yemen.

And this is episode 10 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump\u003c/strong>: Perhaps no single regulation threatens our miners, energy workers, and companies more than this crushing attack on American industry. My action today is the latest in a series of steps to create American jobs and to grow American wealth. We’re ending the theft of American prosperity and rebuilding our beloved country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump wrapped himself in the cloak of “America First” with a backdrop of coal miners, and he bragged openly, for all the world to see, that he wants to destroy the environment in the name of corporate profits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter:\u003c/strong> Rank and order, as you see it, the greatest challenges facing the United States: Russia, China, radical Islam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I’ll tell you the one thing I know isn’t is global warming. That’s the one thing. Crowd cheers] No, no. That’s the one thing I know isn’t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump has put a climate change denier in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt. He put a buffoon, Rick Perry, in charge of the Department of Energy. And Trump handed the U.S. State Department over to Exxon Mobil’s sort of former CEO, Rex Tillerson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rex Tillerson:\u003c/strong> Words like “climate consensus” don’t mean anything to us. They ring hollow because they are — that’s an oxymoronic statement. You cannot have a —you cannot have a scientific consensus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On Tuesday of this week, Trump issued yet another executive order, or as he calls it, executive action, smashing to pieces the Obama era initiative that was known as the Clean Power Plan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We have a very, very impressive group here to celebrate the start of a new era in American energy and production and job creation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And when Obama announced that in 2014, he said that climate change was a national security issue, and the point of that plan was to try to move the U.S. away from energy sources that would damage the environment. Now, radical activists, environmental activists criticized that plan as not going far enough, but it was something. And we had a president that actually acknowledged that climate change was real.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, at the same time, Trump has begun issuing construction permits for the Keystone Pipeline that had been delayed, and Obama had intervened at the end, and you had the uprisings at Standing Rock. Now, Trump, gloating that he’s gonna make the Pipeline great again, starts issuing these construction permits. Now, there’s no doubt that this pipeline has the potential, the great potential to cause serious harm to the homelands of indigenous people across swaths of the United States where this pipeline is gonna run. And it’s also going to put at risk the environment, the drinking water of ranchers and farmers and others in the path of this snaking pipeline. This is nothing short of a declaration of war on the planet that is coming directly from the Oval Office, directly from the most powerful position in the world. And they know damn well that climate change is real. They know it’s not a hoax. So, why do they lie, lie, lie? Money. Money and profits. It’s as simple as that. It is a necessary lie for their corporate profits. They are treating the planet like it’s a stock that they can short and then make a killing on. And they know that one day, it’s all gonna come violently crashing to pieces, but the short-term profits, they’re worth more to these bandits than the livelihood of the planet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m joined now by my colleague Naomi Klein. She has investigated and reported on climate change and its effects around the world, and she’s also exposed some of the greatest corporate and human vultures who have contributed to this war against the planet and the war against our health. Naomi’s latest book is “This Changes Everything: Capitalism Versus the Climate.” Naomi is now a senior correspondent for The Intercept. Naomi, Welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Naomi Klein:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy. It’s great to be with you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we’ve got a lot to cover on the environment, on deregulation, on the insanity that seems to be taking place 24/7 at the White House. But I want to begin with the Keystone XL pipeline.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Today, I’m pleased to announce the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. It’s gonna be an incredible pipeline, greatest technology known to man or woman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump is issuing construction permits and moving forward with this incredibly controversial pipeline that has sparked massive indigenous-led protests in this country. Give us an overview of what the stakes are here and what’s happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> So, I mean, this isn&#8217;t a surprise. It was one of his campaign pledges. It&#8217;s — he actually pushed it ahead his first day on the job. Now, it&#8217;s moving further along. They were waiting for State Department approval, which they now have, and they have —without any kind of environmental assessment, they said they’d considered all of the factors and then listed them. And not one of those factors was climate change, which is really significant, because when Obama finally said no to Keystone after years of protests, he said that one of the factors was that it would contribute to climate change. And that&#8217;s because of what is in the pipes. The pipe starts in the Alberta Tar Sands, and it ends at Gulf Coast refineries. That Southern leg is already constructed, but it&#8217;s the Northern leg, coming from Canada, going through South Dakota and Nebraska. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s yet to be constructed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, the reason why this is relevant in terms of climate change, it&#8217;s two-fold. One, because the oil in Alberta is a particularly heavy, carbon-intensive kind of oil. It has the consistency of tar. So, what you have to do is mine it. And so, there are many accidents associated with it. It&#8217;s a particularly dangerous form of fuel on a bunch of different levels. But also, this process of mining takes more energy than a conventional barrel of oil. On average, it takes three times more fossil fuels to extract one barrel of tar sands oil than a conventional barrel of North American crude. So, from a climate perspective, it&#8217;s a disaster. This has been such a defining feature of the Trump administration, this determination to unleash a fossil fuel frenzy. It is a major, major, major priority of Donald Trump. And it is not the only way to create jobs. There are — you can create many more jobs, exponentially more jobs, if you invest in renewables, if you invest in energy efficiency, if you invest in public transit, than if you build a pipeline, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean Keystone is going to create 35 permanent jobs at the end of the day. But it is a very lazy way to create jobs, right? And it should not be lost on people that the company that will gain the most if these pipelines, these various pipelines, are constructed is ExxonMobil, the company that Rex Tillerson, now Secretary of State, was head of until a couple of months ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ExxonMobile Advertisement: \u003c/strong>Oil sands projects like Kearl and the Keystone Pipeline will provide secure and reliable energy to the United States. Over the coming years, projects like these could create more than half a million jobs in the U.S. alone. From the Canadian border to the Midwest . . .\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Exxon has around one-third of its fossil fuel reserves tied up in the Alberta Tar Sands. Now, if they can&#8217;t get those reserves out, if they can&#8217;t dig it up because they don&#8217;t have the pipeline capacity, which is the current situation, then those become stranded assets. And of course, they also become stranded assets if there&#8217;s serious climate regulation. And of course, the Trump Administration is waging war on climate action on every front, most notably this week&#8217;s attack on Obama&#8217;s Clean Power Plan, which is the centerpiece of the Obama administration&#8217;s plan to reduce emissions.\u003cstrong> \u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What are the long-term stakes of actions like constructing the Keystone Pipeline or extracting the Alberta tar sands? Like, why does this matter to our planet? In plain terms, what is this gonna do?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> So, right now, we have warmed the planet by one degree Celsius, and we are already seeing huge impacts from that, from massive wildfires — and this is happening right now under the Trump administration, although you wouldn&#8217;t know it from Donald Trump&#8217;s tweets. But the prairies have seen huge wildfires that have killed tens of thousands of cattle. Ranchers there are calling this their Katrina because they&#8217;re being completely ignored.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter:\u003c/strong> The wildfires have already swallowed dozens of structures and millions of acres as they continue to grow, marching across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado, where strong winds and dry conditions have created a tinderbox.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> If we do not radically get — move very, very quickly to get 100 percent renewable energy by mid-century, which is very soon, then we will have lost our chance to prevent warming at double what we&#8217;ve already done. So, we&#8217;ve increased temperature by one degree Celsius. We&#8217;re already seeing the bleaching and die-off of natural wonders of the world like the Great Barrier Reef. We&#8217;re already seeing a huge increase in drought and forest fires. We&#8217;re already seeing sea level rise and super-storms like super-storm Sandy. We will increase temperatures more than that. That&#8217;s already locked in. But if we do everything we can and mobilize wartime efforts, we could move quickly enough to prevent warming of more than two degrees, or if we are we extremely lucky, 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But if we do what we&#8217;re doing, which is known as business as usual, i.e., pretend it&#8217;s not happening and just keep digging up this stuff — what that leads to is four to six degrees of warming. Now, that comes from not 350.org or Greenpeace. That comes from the World Bank. That comes from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Four degrees Celsius of warming is incompatible with anything you could describe as organized, civilized life. Even with two degrees warming, Jeremy, we may well be losing coastal cities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And so, how would that happen, if the base temperature of the world increases by two degrees or four degrees, as you&#8217;re saying could potentially happen? Does it mean, then, we see more tsunamis, we see more earthquakes, floods, etc.? Like, what is — what would this look like if we end up at four degrees or six degrees increase in temperature?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Even thinking about two degrees, we will see significant sea level rise that could potentially threaten coastal cities like New York, like Mumbai — major, major population centers — at two degrees. The problem is, we&#8217;ve waited so long that that is the only kind of target that seems feasible if we do everything possible. The centerpiece of the U.S.&#8217;s Climate Action Plan is exactly what is being dismantled, right now, by the EPA under Scott Pruitt, which is the Clean Power Plan. And so, yes, it means warmer ocean temperatures, which is what superpower storms like Katrina and Sandy — you know, you could never say, &#8220;Well, this one storm was caused by climate change.” The storm would&#8217;ve happened anyway. But what turns it into a super-storm — and we&#8217;re seeing these sort of once-in-a-century storms happening with greater and greater frequency — is that added accelerant of temperatures being that much warmer, and also, the baseline sea level being that much higher, so that the storms are reaching into areas that — where they have never reached before. The high water mark is changing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we are already going to be dealing with a rocky future, which is why the Trump administration&#8217;s war on the public sector is so dangerous. I mean it&#8217;s so dangerous and so profoundly cruel on so many levels. But from a climate perspective, the very fact of collecting data that this is even happening is being attacked at NASA —satellite programs that tell us that Arctic ice is melting, leading to sea level rise. So, they want us to be blind, [laughs] and they want to do nothing about it. And I think part of what we&#8217;re going to see under Trump is the rise of very privatized disaster response. You and I reported together from New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina and saw that the corporate states descend on the city, the Blackwater Private Security, and Bechtel, and Flour, and Halliburton, and the whole Baghdad Gang coming into profit from it. And this is what frankly worries me most, because I think, you know, there&#8217;s — I think we&#8217;re paying too much attention to these minor schisms within the Bush administration of, you know, whether not —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You said Bush. It’s Trump. But okay, point taken.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Oh no, I’m sorry, Jeremy! [Laughs] This has been happening to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Fair enough. Fair enough.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I realized that the incredible similarities between Donald Trump and Paul Bremer, you know, locked up in the Green Zone issuing executive orders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He hunkered down in the White House this weekend and made a big deal about how he was staying in town to actually work instead of going golfing — not golfing at Mar-a-Lago. I wanted to —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> The sacrifice! It&#8217;s incredible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And one other — you know, you were talking about the privatized disaster response. I mean, even on a kind of micro-level in cities around the country, we already see privatized fire forces, firefighting forces where if there are wildfires that break out, including because of climate change, the ultra-wealthy have contracts with privatized firefighters that will go and put out the fires for them. If you&#8217;re poor and the budget has been gutted and there is no fire department, well, your land’s just gonna blow. You know, it’s — the fire&#8217;s gonna blow through it, and, and you&#8217;re finished.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> In California, we heard a few years back that AIG had pioneered what they were calling a concierge service for their higher-end customers where, you know, if a fire was coming to your area, they would rush in with these private firefighters and spray your home in fire retardant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AIG Advertisement:\u003c/strong> Some of the most beautiful places to live are prone to natural disasters. That’s why AIG created the Wildfire Protection Unit. This complimentary service helps our customers prepare their homes to withstand wildfire season.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Meanwhile, 4,000 of California’s state firefighters are prison inmates being paid between one and two dollars an hour to fight fires. So, this disaster apartheid is here. You know, and that&#8217;s the phrase I used when I wrote “The Shock Doctrine,” but it&#8217;s accelerating quickly. And this is why I think we can really overstate the importance of whether or not Rex Tillerson and Ivanka believe climate change is happening versus Trump, who says it&#8217;s a hoax, and Pruitt, who denies the science. What they all share in common is that they think they&#8217;re gonna be fine. And that is what is so scary about this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The New Yorker had a really good piece a month or so ago on high-end survivalism, right? The people in Silicon Valley and Wall Street building gilded bunkers, buying land, — elevated land, in New Zealand, and really, you know, luxury prepping for the disasters to come that are the intersection between social collapse and climate change. So, what we&#8217;re seeing is the loss of an incentive to solve these problems. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really worrying. You know, what matters is not what an individual person in the Trump administration says or doesn&#8217;t say about the science of climate change. The problem is, they think they&#8217;re gonna be okay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. I mean, it&#8217;s sort of like their version of “The Purge.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>The Purge:\u003c/strong> This is not a test. This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Where — except, like, climate is the killing fields, and lack of appropriate disaster response, lack of evacuation — evactuation plans from the public sector, the kinds of abandoning of cities like you saw in New Orleans. I mean, in a way, this is the most twisted version of their idea of social Darwinism mixed in with a Hollywood horror-esque scenario, like “The Purge.” It’s really, like, kind of “The Purge” for the climate. I don’t know if you watched that movie — those movies — that movie series.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And this is happening, right? I mean, Rex — coming back to Rex Tillerson, right, who — his company —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before you go to Rex Tillerson, can I just ask you, Naomi Klein, have you seen any of the Purge movies?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m sort of feeling badly that I have not seen them. But I’ve seen many dystopian sci-fi films. You know, and I feel like part of the problem that we have is that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But do you know what “The Purge,” what the basis of “The Purge” is? Can I just tell you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> What is the basis?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. So, “The Purge” is set in our world, but slightly in the future. And the policy in the United States that the government has set is that for 24 hours once a year, murder is legal, and anyone can go out and murder, or maim, or attack anyone they want, and it&#8217;s perfectly lawful, and you have exactly 24 hours to do it. And it&#8217;s a trilogy of movies. And in the first film, you see that wealthier families have very sophisticated security systems to protect them from the Purge, and that you have a lot of poor people or people without resources being subjected to either random murder, or neighbors, or gangsters, or what have you, settling scores. And also, the ultra-wealthy pay to go to clubs where they can actually kill poor people that have been abducted by a private company that then delivers them to the gathering for the rich people to murder in a kind of burlesque show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>The Purge:\u003c/strong> Don’t force us to hurt you. We don’t want to kill our own. Please just let us purge. Toodle-oo, Sandins.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Are they good?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No. But the fact that I&#8217;m talking about them means that they&#8217;re relevant —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Because in a way, it&#8217;s sort of prescient. I mean, it’s — I really do feel like if they&#8217;re not intending to implement the Purge here, this is a very brilliant, unintentional plagiarism of those films that Trump and his team are engaged in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> The feeling that I think so many people had during the aftermath of Katrina, which was like, this is too sci-fi. It&#8217;s too sci-fi that Blackwater is here. It&#8217;s too sci-fi that this is being seen as a site for profit. Let&#8217;s not forget that the other thing that was happening in New Orleans is that white vigilantes were hunting black people on the streets. Let&#8217;s not forget that the New Orleans Police Department has had to pay settlements because their police officers were shooting black people to keep them from getting to safety. That future is already here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, and just one other note. I remember, when we were in New Orleans, seeing Israeli security guards that had been flown by helicopter from Texas into New Orleans, and they deployed outside of a gated community. And when I interviewed them, they were from a company called ISI, Instinctive Shooting International. And they were there. Some of them were, you know, veterans who had been in Lebanon, you know, of the Israeli Intelligence or Armed Forces—been in Lebanon, been in Palestine, and here they were with semi-automatic weapons deployed in defense of the rich in New Orleans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DemocracyNow! host Amy Goodman:\u003c/strong> We’re joined now by two journalists who’ve just returned from New Orleans. On the line from Canada is writer and author Naomi Klein. Her piece in The Nation is called “Purging the Poor.” And we’re joined in our studio by Democracy Now correspondent Jeremy Scahill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I remember those days. We need to look really, really closely at these models, right? This is not about the future. This is about the present. If we want — and this is where the road we&#8217;re on leads, right? So, Rex Tillerson, now Secretary of State, when he was CEO of Exxon, after this company conducted their own climate change research in the 1970s, cutting edge climate change research: They were taking C02 samples off of their oil tankers, publishing articles — their own scientists saying, &#8220;Yes, this is happening, yes this is a real”— does this about-turn in the ‘90s and pours money into climate change denial. Exxon knew all about climate change. They knew about it before Hansen testified on Capitol Hill in 1988 and said, &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s happening. Humans are causing it.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They knew all about it. They were already rejigging their operations, thinking about — and this, you know, has come out in investigative reporting by Inside Climate News, by the LA Times. So now, we know what they knew when they knew it, or some of it, right? That they were looking at the opportunities that would come from melting Arctic ice and the ability to drill for oil. They were planning to raise their drilling rigs to compensate for sea level rise. They knew all about it, and yet they poured millions into very, very strong lobbying to keep the U.S. from signing the Kyoto Protocol. Full-page ads in the New York Times taken out by Mobil saying, &#8220;The science isn&#8217;t clear.&#8221; They knew the science was clear. Pouring money into climate change denial, spreading doubt. We lost decades because of this company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Finally, Rex Tillerson, I think it was in 2011, publicly says, &#8220;Yes, climate change is happening, but humans will adapt.&#8221; Right? So, if you can&#8217;t grow food in one place, humans have always adapted. Now, how do humans adapt to not being able to grow food, Jeremy? They move. They seek safety. They do what humans do and have a human right to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But we now are in this era of fortressed continents — continents fortressing themselves using these same private contractors. I mean, this is Erik Prince&#8217;s new business, right? What&#8217;s it called, Frontier Services something?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Frontier Services Group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> So, he pitches himself to the European Union as the guy who’s gonna keep the boats from ever getting there. These privatized camps on islands, on Nauru, on Manus, where the Australian government intercepts ships, flies migrants fleeing war zones to these camps that are run by private contractors. By the way, this is what caused Donald Trump to hang up on the Prime Minister of Australia, ‘cause there was a deal made between Obama and Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of Australia, to take some of those refugees because the Australian government is so determined not to let them into their country. You know, Rex Tillerson says humans adapt, but yet he&#8217;s working for an administration that understands, actually, how humans are adapting is by turning people who dare to try to find safety into criminals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, shifting to — I just wanted to briefly touch on the Clean Power Plan. This was the Obama administration initiative that began in the summer of 2014 that was aimed at reducing carbon pollution from power plants. And the Obama administration portrayed it as this very strong stance on climate change. So — and we know now that Trump is right now initiating the dismantling of that. So, explain what the Clean Power Plan was under Obama, ‘cause you were critical of Obama as well, and what this means that Trump is dismantling it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> So, this was about getting off coal-powered energy. And so, it would have shut down a lot of coal-powered refineries. And the reason why I was critical is that far too many of them were being replaced with natural gas from fracking, with all of the environmental risks associated with that. You know, we keep learning more and more about how much methane is being leaked, how much methane is produced in the fracking process, and also just in the burning itself. And one of the things that the Trump administration is doing, by the way — at the end of the Obama administration, they started to get serious about this and were requiring much better monitoring and reporting to find out how much methane was being released and leaked — and one of the first things that the Trump administration has done is said, “Oh, we don’t want to know — not only do we not want to know if climate change is happening, we don’t want to know what you’re polluting.” So, this is part of their “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy around climate change. It was not good enough, but it was important. It was important. It just wasn’t enough. And this is why a lot of us thought that, you know, we were gonna be having to push very hard under a Clinton presidency to try to get much more ambitious climate policies. But this is much, much worse to get rid of it, obviously.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think it needs to be understood as part of a broader war on the poor and on people of color in the United States by the Trump administration. Because of the fact of environmental racism in the United States, it means that the communities that have had the dirtiest coal powered fire plants are overwhelmingly communities of color, where you have very, very high rates of asthma and over respiratory illnesses, cancer clusters, because of the siting of these dirty industries in their backgrounds. The EPA under Scott Pruitt is completely eliminating the Environmental Justice Program, which was the program dealing with this very, very unequal siting of where the most pollution is happening and who’s having — whose bodies are dealing with the impacts. So, you know, I think that this is both a climate disaster —it’s also a human rights disaster because of the enormous health risks associated with coal. Which is not to say natural gas is great, but coal is particularly noxious for human health.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to talk for a moment about Jared Kushner — this is Donald Trump’s son-in-law and by many accounts, the central figure, along with Steve Bannon, wandering the West Wing. And this is the guy that Trump has — the kid — that Trump has put in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. I’m gonna tell you. And he’s very good at politics, so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But he recently created a new position for Jared Kushner, heading up what they’re calling the “White House Office of American Innovation,” which is staffed entirely by former corporate executives, of course, from Goldman Sachs, and General Motors, and Microsoft, etc. They’re calling them the SWAT team of strategic consultants. And of course, at the heart of this is deregulation. Your response to the role of Jared Kushner — but also the mission of this Office of American Innovation? I mean, it really is kind of a horribly, violently ironic name to be given to this department worthy of Orwell.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> It is, and also just kind of honest, right? Because this is a war on the public sphere, and now they have a SWAT team. And the SWAT team is gonna be looking for more things to cut. Bush announced — sorry. What am I gonna do, Jeremy? [Laughs] I keep doing it. Trump announced, I believe it was his first day on the job, that there would be a 75 percent cut in regulation under his administration, so I think probably what they&#8217;re gonna be looking for is any way they can to cut regulations. I mean, this is gonna have huge implications for food safety, for water safety — and they&#8217;re also looking for privatization opportunities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And recently, Jared Kushner sort of put a fine point on what you&#8217;re saying when he told the Washington Post, &#8220;The government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I mean, the really chilling part, of course, is what Donald Trump has done as a businessman. You know, how he has run his incredibly opaque company, the number of bankruptcies, the number of ripped off workers and contractors. I mean, he so consistently sacrifices his own investors, his — you know, his own partners, and just looks out for number one, you know? This has been — the expansion of his business model internationally has been based on just leasing his name, right? I mean this is what his sons are out doing. They&#8217;re not building buildings themselves. For the most part, they&#8217;re selling the Trump name. One Trump development project in Panama, they got $50 million from in licensing and branding fees. So, it&#8217;s incredibly lucrative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But when there are problems, and there are very often problems with Trump developments, whether — if it’s not on time; if it’s — if people aren’t able to — these are often revenue properties. If they feel that they&#8217;ve been lied to, whatever happens — and there have been several collapses — Trump is not responsible, right? The liabilities are held by these business partners to whom he’s just leased his name. So, if the U.S. government is run anything like the Trump organization: Expect to be looted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] All right. On that very uplifting note, we&#8217;ll end it there.

And in that analysis, we understand that the primary contradiction in this system comes at the point of exploitation. And so, our critiques are not just of the government. They’re of the ruling class. And the ruling class are the puppet masters that the government works for. So, in the sense that Trump has been part of the ruling class for a while — that’s why critique of him was needed — whereas most public schools and private schools, for that matter, teach us that capitalism is the way to some sort of freedom and some sort of power individually. Our culture mimics that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we’re told that to get rich, it takes merely rugged individualism, and that that is something to be looked up toward. So, many hip-hop songs have looked up to Trump, not because people are stupid, but because people are going off the information that we’re taught in elementary, junior high, high school, and college, and making that into song. But we need to take advantage of this clarity that’s happening right now and show people that it’s not just — it’s not a personality contest, that Trump being in office is a development that has come from years of the Democrats rolling it slowly towards this direction, and the Republicans, obviously.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Boots.

And Donald Trump claimed on the campaign trail that he was against the U.S. invasion of Iraq back in 2003. Now, that’s in dispute, but he claimed it over and over and over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We should have kept the oil when we got out. And, you know, it’s very interesting — had we taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And now, Trump seems to be getting his own Iraq War. I mean, the Iraq War has been going on for, you know — you could say for decades, but certainly since 2003. But Trump is sort of initiating a new campaign. There are more U.S. ground troops moving to the region and onto the ground in Syria and Iraq. They’re still calling them advisers, but it’s clear that they are gonna be in a combat role. Trump has also taken moves to give military commanders much greater authority to conduct strikes, even when they know that civilians are gonna be killed. And it’s important to be clear. You know, Barack Obama authorized both overt and covert wars and military operations that killed tremendous numbers of civilians. And at least Obama on numerous occasions paid lip service to the idea that killing civilians is wrong, and that the U.S. doesn’t want to be doing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> And for the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss. For me and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump, though, appears to believe in scorched earth. And on just one day earlier this month, U.S. airstrikes in Mosul, Iraq and the north of Iraq killed around 200 people. And there are some reports that suggest that in just one incident, that 80 civilians may have been killed as they huddled in a basement trying to get shelter from these air raids. While all of this is happening in Iraq and Syria, Saudi Arabia’s continuing to just utterly destroy Yemen. Defense Secretary General James Mattis is reportedly pushing Trump to try to expand the U.S. military’s role inside of Yemen and to directly go after the Houthi militias that rule parts of that country in it’s civil war. And part of what we’re seeing happening here is a proxy war with Iran. That could quickly morph into something much worse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss all of this, I’m joined now by the Intercept’s Murtaza Hussain. Murtaza covers these wars and other issues for us at The Intercept. Maz, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza Hussain:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Maz, it seems like wall-to-wall coverage right now in the United States on cable news and online is all about whatever palace intrigue exists in the Trump administration, and the battle between Trump and the Republicans over healthcare, and what’s happening with Trump’s inner circle. And yet, we had strikes that have killed more civilians and more people in a small amount of time since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. Why do you think this story is not getting more attention in the broader news media?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Unfortunately, Iraqis and other have become simply numbers. These numbers are very hard to even humanize at this point. The past 26 years, the United States has been bombing Iraq almost continuously, or at war with Iraq in some form almost continuously. This attack in Mosul is perhaps one of the deadliest mass —single mass casualty attacks in the past few decades, but it’s not the only one. There was a very devastating attack during the first Gulf War, which killed upwards of 400 people in a bomb shelter in Amiriyah. Unfortunately, Iraqis have become dehumanized in American discourse. And the death of 200 people barely even registers. They’ve become merely statistics. And it’s depressing, but it’s become unsurprising that the news media and the public at large has just tuned out of these terrible, terrible massacres.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And we do know that at the end of Barack Obama’s time in office, they were already ratcheting up the strikes. But what Trump did early on in his administration was to lift some of the — I don’t want to say restrictions — but some of the rules in place that the military was, at least on paper, supposed to be governed by concerning potential civilian deaths. That seems to now be radically either reduced or altogether obliterated under Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yeah. It’s no secret that there were a huge number of similar deadly airstrikes under the Obama administration. But Obama did attempt to at least introduce some constraints on rules of engagement for the U.S. military to minimize those deaths. Because, if nothing else, they’re strategically costly and they’re bad for the image of the United States and they’re not conducive to achieving goals, even in these theaters. Trump made no secret about his intention to conduct U.S. wars in a more brutal fashion. He campaigned specifically on a platform of taking the gloves off against all U.S. enemies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, he put it very eloquently when he said, I believe it was —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> ISIS is making tremendous amount of money because they have certain oil camps, right? They have certain areas of oil that they took away. They have some in Syria, some in Iraq. I would bomb the shit of ‘em. [Crowd cheering] I would just bomb those suckers. And that’s right. I’d blow up the pipes. I’d blow up the refi —I’d blow up every single inch. There would be nothing left. And you know what? You’ll get Exxon to come in there in two months. You ever see these guys, how good they are, the great oil companies? They’ll rebuild that sucker brand new. It’ll be beautiful. And I’d rig it, and I’d take the oil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> He was very stark and blunt about what he was gonna do. And people voted for him based on that. He was applauded at debates for these sort of statements. And now, what you’re seeing since he was elected are numerous — what can’t be called anything other than massacres, which have happened by U.S. forces not just through airstrikes, but also that deadly raid in Yemen a few weeks ago, which killed dozens of civilians. Iraqi forces have said that they have noticed an increasing laxity in U.S. targeting standards in the past few weeks in the Mosul operation. And the U.S. military has not conceded it’s changed its rules of operation. But the proof seems to be — or the indication seems to be in these staggering civilian death tolls in these strikes in the last few weeks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Well, and it seems as though we’re — well, we are witnessing an increased deployment of U.S. personnel on the ground. I mean, they’re still kind of grooming the media to refer to them as advisers, but the reality is that there are both conventional and Special Operations forces that are being deployed on the ground in both Syria and Iraq right now. Where is this headed, in your view?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Well, Trump, one of the mainstays of his campaign was he was going to escalate the war against ISIS, and he’s escalating it. He’s sending ground troops in to fight. I think we’re gonna see major battles in Raqqa and other territories held by ISIS, and maybe even U.S. ground troops in Mosul, if the Iraqi operation stalls, which it seems to be at the moment. I think that you’re seeing an escalation of U.S. involvement in all these theaters, and not just in Iraq and Syria, but also in a totally separate conflict in Yemen against the Houthis. You’re seeing very strong indications the U.S. is gonna be more directly involved in supporting Emirati and Saudi aggression against the Yemenis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s the endgame here?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> That’s a very good question.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, from the U.S. perspective or from some of these Gulf monarchies that are financing these wars, who stands to gain from the policy as it currently is unfolding on the ground?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Well, there seem to be two goals the U.S. is trying to achieve. And neither of them are very well defined goals. The first one is to, okay, degrade ISIS and take the territories out of its control, which is fine, but then you’re setting up what’s the day two after that? How do you prevent this group from reemerging, or an even more vicious group from reemerging out of the defeat — the very brutal, it seems, defeat of their territories right now? Secondly, you have a broader campaign by the Trump administration as Gulf allies to roll back Iranian influence in the region. The thing is, the reason Iranian influence increased in the region in the first place is in large part a product of U.S. actions, like the war on Iraq and the war on Afghanistan, which took out two major Iranian enemies and allows Iran to spread influence much further.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So now, the intention is to roll back Iranian influence starting in Yemen. But that can only be a very long, very costly, and very involved effort by the United States. It will be a year’s-long effort. Very bloody and very uncertain to roll back Iranian gains in the last few years. So, I think what you’re seeing is a new era of warfare throughout the region, and not just with the U.S. and Iranian-backed forces, but also — it could also involve Israel, too, because Israel is threatened by developments in Syria and elsewhere in the region. And you could very well see in the near future a war between Israel and Iran or Iranian-backed forces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Murtaza Hussain, Thank you very much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Apple commercial\u003c/strong>: Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Apple is certainly one of the most powerful companies in the world, not just because of its financial position, but because of its central role in so many peoples’ private lives. And yet, Apple, this huge, powerful corporation — yeah, they seem to be afraid of one of my colleagues here at The Intercept, Josh Begley. Five years ago, Josh created an app that would ping you whenever the U.S. conducted a drone strike. And of course, those happened a lot under President Obama. But over these years, Josh has discovered that Apple does not seem to be a very big fan of his app. I’m joined now by Josh Begley. Welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Josh Begley:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we get into the whole situation now between you and Apple over your app, why don’t you take us back to when you first created this drone strike tracking app, and what was the purpose that you wanted it to serve?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> So, the original idea for the app was really simple. I could not think of anything that felt further away than the drone war, and so, I wanted to be in touch with it a little bit more closely. And so, I was sort of wondering what it would mean if I received a notification every time one of these drone strikes was reported in the news. Say I’m walking down the street and my phone buzzes. Maybe I think it’s my friend texting me, and then I’m sort of surprised by this unsettling news. Would that change my relationship to the drone war at all? —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> It did, certainly, because the last five years have been this sort of ongoing process of submitting and resubmitting an app that I never thought I would continue to update, because of the particularities of Apple’s secrecy. And it has actually made me learn a tremendous amount about the geography of Pakistan and Yemen and Somalia, and where these drone strikes take place.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And when you created it—just kind of walk people through how it worked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Mm. So, it was dead simple at first. I really just wanted it to ping your phone every time one of these reports was mentioned in the press. I didn’t really want it to have much functionality. But originally, Apple said that that was not useful, so I added a map, and I added a newsfeed. And then, it ended up getting through the App Store after three rejections because they said it was, “excessively crude or objectionable content.” The fifth time I submitted it, it actually was accepted, and it was in the App Store for about a year. And so, for about a year, I was sending out these alerts every time a drone strike was reported in the news. It definitely changed my relationship to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wait, wait, wait. Back up a second here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, you create the app. The initial criticism from Apple was that it was so stripped down that it didn’t serve a real purpose.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You then upped your game. You created a map, etc. And it was rejected on what grounds?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> On “excessively crude or objectionable content.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did you ever get any understanding of what it was that they found crude or objectionable?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> You know: No. The process for approving apps is somewhat labyrinthine, and there have been a number of people that have had the experience of having apps rejected a bunch. But they never really comment and tell you why. They’ll just say, “Oh, it was under this 2.1 or 1.1.” I forget the actual technical term. But it’s “excessively crude or objectionable content.” They said it would be either not useful, or not enough people would be interested in it, and then finally, that it was objectionable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and let’s remember here that there are all manner of stalking apps that are available on the App Store. There are apps with an overtly racist theme in some of the games. Not to mention all the shit that’s happened with companies like Uber. And, you know, Uber’s app has led to a lot of objectionable content — actions in some part committed by their drivers and the CEO toward the drivers. But somehow, your app, which is intended to put people in more touch with what their tax dollars are being used for and their foreign policy, was declared “crude and objectionable.” Now, I woke up on Tuesday morning this week, and when I looked at The Intercept, I saw an article that you wrote saying after, you know, numerous — a dozen, I think — rejections, Apple had finally accepted your app in the App Store. And you did an article about it, and people start downloading it. And then, we start getting messages from people saying, “It’s not working for me.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What happened?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> So, on Tuesday morning, the app was in the store for about five hours, and I sort of was thinking, maybe Apple changed their mind. Maybe they were gonna let it be there, and maybe they were gonna stop blocking it. And around 2 o’clock, I received a push notification on my iPhone that told me that it was removed from sale. And then there were some people tweeting about how it had not been available in the store when they tried to download it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And when you say sale, it was free?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> It was free.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Totally free.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what was the name that you registered the app under?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> It was called Metadata. About in 2012 or 2013, when I was submitting it a bunch of times, Metadata was the name we went with because it really was metadata about English language news reports. There isn’t a whole lot of data to speak of about a lot of these reports. So, that’s why the app is so barebones. It’s really just sending you a sentence, maybe, or a small little bit of narrative about what happened in one of these drone strikes that’s reported in Pakistan, Yemen, or Somalia. And so, I received a notification that told me it was not in the store. And I suppose that that was to be expected on the one hand, but at the same time, I kind of thought Apple might have come around.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, with the Trump administration relaxing — it’s such a strange phrase to use, but that’s how it is — relaxing some of the restrictions on operations that will kill civilians or the likelihood of killing civilians, and with the pummeling that we just talked about with Murtaza Hussain that we’re seeing in Iraq and Syria with these increased airstrikes, have you considered expanding the app to not just be exclusively about drone strikes, but to include all sorts of U.S. airstrikes?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I think my own biggest critique of the app is that it’s in some ways too narrow, because the distinction between a drone strike and an airstrike by a manned aircraft is pretty insignificant if you’re on the ground, right? The missiles land sort of in the same way. And so, I think expanding it to include both unofficial and official war zones perhaps would be a more accurate reflection. If you really want to be in touch with our foreign policy and with the drone war, what does it mean to be in touch with all airstrikes that the U.S. launches or that the Saudi campaign sort of backed by the U.S. launches? What would that mean? Would that change our relationship to our own foreign policy in any sort of meaningful way?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know it sucks that they pulled it down for a number of reasons. But one thought I had is if somehow Donald Trump discovered this, and he learned that the U.S. was doing all these drone strikes around the world and other airstrikes around the world, maybe he would tweet against these strikes if he was aware that they were happening. I mean, ‘cause that’s — that really — he gets a lot of information from social media. So that, I think, is the grand disappointment: That you do not fall into the category of Breitbart in briefing the President.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josh Begley, thank you for creating the app. We’ll continue to follow this saga. And, you know, if people feel so inclined, I think they should reach out to Apple and let them know that this kind of censorship undermines the democratic spirit of our society because it strips us of an ability to understand the actions of our government. So, Josh Begley, thanks for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that does it for this week’s show.

On the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s militant speech against the Vietnam War, television host and author Tavis Smiley talks about the “Santa Clausification” of Dr. King and explains why he would not be allowed to speak at his own memorial events today.

Barbara Lee reflects on her own historic speech, delivered three days after 9/11, when she was the only member of Congress to oppose the blank check given to Bush and Cheney to wage an unchecked war on the world.

And Nixon did go to China. He went along with Henry Kissinger. And Nixon held his historic meetings with Chairman Mao Zedong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> China is ripping us off.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> You know who’s getting the oil? China!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> What China’s doing to us is horrible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This week, Nixon’s heir apparent, or hair apparent, Donald Trump, is meeting with the current leader of China, President Xi Jinping. Now, this historic meeting is not taking place in China. It’s taking place at Trump’s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. We understand that President Xi does not golf, so the visit could pose some issues for Donald Trump. Now, when Richard Nixon set up his meeting for China and to meet with the leader of China, he used his emissary, Henry Kissinger, to lay the groundwork for that trip. Donald Trump also has his own emissaries — people like Steve Bannon and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Last December, Bannon, Kushner and General Mike Flynn, who you’ll remember was briefly Trump’s National Security Adviser — they had a secret meeting with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, in New York City. And that’s according to the Washington Post. What they discussed in that meeting, we don’t know. But then the story gets really interesting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A few weeks after that meeting in New York involving Bannon and Kushner and General Flynn and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, the Sheikh helped set up a meeting in the Seychelles Islands for an unofficial emissary of then President-elect Donald Trump. And that unofficial shadow emissary was none other than the notorious mercenary and founder of Blackwater: Erik Prince. Now, according to the Washington Post, that meeting was, in part, intended to put Erik Prince in the presence of Russian officials. And the meetings were supposedly, according to the Post, a way that a backchannel could be set up for communications between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, I reported in January for The Intercept that Erik Prince had been a secret adviser to the Trump administration. Now, of course, Prince and his family were major bankrollers of the Trump campaign. Prince’s sister, Betsy DeVos, is the Education Secretary. And to flesh out this whole situation of Donald Trump’s secret little Prince, I’m joined now by the Editor-in-Chief of The Intercept, Betsy Reed. Betsy, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Betsy Reed:\u003c/strong> Hey, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, the reason, Betsy, that I wanted to discuss this with you is that you and I have worked on the Blackwater Erik Prince story going back to 2005, when you were my editor at The Nation magazine. And you also edited my book, “Blackwater: The Rise of the World’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army.” So, you and I have been immersed in this story for many, many years. What was your reaction when you saw that Erik Prince — that the Washington Post reported that Erik Prince had been involved with a backchannel meeting in the Seychelles involving the United Arab Emirates brokering a meeting between Erik Prince as a kind of emissary unofficial for Donald Trump and Russian officials?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, on one level, it’s shocking, right? Because this is a man who’s like so notorious and so discredited, and has been at the center of so many horrifying scandals — that he could be playing this role, and again, you know, at the center of the news — it’s just, it’s kind of amazing, right? But, you know, as you essentially predicted, you wrote a piece about how Erik Prince was advising Donald Trump from the shadows. And, you know, you’ve also written about Mike Pence and how ideologically, it actually is not surprising at all to find Erik Prince right at the center of the Trump administration, given his sort of similar Christian supremacist worldview. So, for people who don’t know who Erik Prince is, how would you sum that up?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, he was the son of a billionaire, and he inherited a huge amount of money. His family was a very powerful rightwing Christian financier of very extreme rightwing political figures and movements in the United States. And he had served — unlike a lot of children of billionaires, he enlisted in the U.S. military and served as a Navy SEAL in Haiti and Bosnia and elsewhere. And when his father died and his first wife was dying of cancer, Prince left the Navy SEALs, went home, helped settle the family, the selling of the family business. He took his share of the inheritance and bought a huge plot of land in the great dismal swamp of North Carolina and started what became known as Blackwater Security and Training. And in the late 1990s, when Blackwater was created — this was pre-9/11 — the main business model of Blackwater was not to provide mercenaries. It was to provide training for the U.S. military, but also training for law enforcement that were going to face down against the violent youth of America’s schools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Columbine Massacre had just happened, and Erik Prince came up with this idea to build a mock high school in his swampland called R. U. Ready High, like the letter ‘R,’ the letter ‘U,’ R.U. Ready High. And the idea was to train SWAT-type forces to deal with school shootings. 9/11 happens, and Erik Prince was interviewed on Bill O’Reilly’s show on Fox News, and he says to Bill O’Reilly that, you know, before 9/11, people didn’t really get what he was about. And now, his phone is ringing off the hook. And what basically happened is that a very powerful figure in the CIA at the time named Buzzy Krongard was friends with the Prince family, and he would take his kids to Erik Prince’s Blackwater to help — to let them shoot on his range.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Buzzy Krongard and Erik Prince made a deal that Prince would recruit a network of former Navy SEALs and other special operatives that could provide a kind of deniable force for the CIA in the early stages of the war on Afghanistan. And Erik Prince actually deployed, with his initial team in a small village on the Afghan-Pakistan border called Shkin, and they set up an outpost that they called the Alamo. And basically, that was the beginning of the Gold Rush for Blackwater providing covert services to the CIA, and later overt services to the U.S. State Department.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I mean, he’s long identified as a libertarian, right? So he believes that government functions should be outsourced. And he has used that model in the realm of security and military operations in order to create these forces that then operate with impunity, without the accountability that is forced on government forces. Is that correct?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Exactly. And libertarian in the sense — I mean, there is one interesting thing. Erik Prince has spoken very critically of Barack Obama’s drone strike killing of Anwar al-Awlaki. And it’s not that Erik Prince has any admiration or support for Awlaki, but the idea that the president of the United States was ordering the assassination of an American citizen who hadn’t been charged with a crime. I wonder if it had been Bush or Cheney, if Prince would have taken that position. But he did take that position, which sounded very similar to that of Ron Paul when he was running his insurgency campaigns.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> But Blackwater itself was involved in secret assassinations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Of course, yeah. And their men were accused in court documents from whistleblowers in the company of doing night hunting in Iraq where they were randomly killing Iraqis. And whistleblowers in the company said that Erik Prince set an overt agenda of Christian supremacy, that this was a war of civilization, and that essentially, all Muslims were fair game. So, you know, he supported Pat Buchanan’s insurgency campaign against George W. Bush in 1992 in the election — in the Republican primary — because he said that the Bush administration was too liberal on social issues like gay marriage and etc. He was an intern in George H.W. Bush’s White House. But, you know, the essence of Erik Prince’s elevator pitch to the national security apparatus is: I want to do for you what FedEx does for the delivery of packages and mail in this country. It’s much more effective than the post office. And let’s run the CIA and the military more like FedEx, rather than the post office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> And key to that is secrecy, right? Is the ability to operate in the shadows, as he’s tried to do in his relationships with Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And this is classic Erik Prince, where part of privatization means that you are — and layering things in subcontracts and outsourcing parts of it to this company or that individual — is that it makes it very difficult for Congressional oversight bodies to actually know who the hell is doing what and for how much money. And we saw that repeatedly in the investigations of Blackwater and Halliburton and KBR. It’s like, who holds the actual contract and who are we hiring to do this stuff? That was part of the worldview that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, their careers were defined by. The idea that the executive branch of government, particularly when Republicans are in power, should operate as an effective dictatorship over national security policy, and Congress should only play the role of financing what the President determines to be necessary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I mean can you believe he’s back, Jeremy? I mean he’s sort of like your white whale.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] You know, it’s — you know, it never ceases to amaze me how often this guy pops up. And, you know, the fact that his sister is the education secretary, I think is only relevant in the sense that they share the same kind of ideological view. She wants to do for education what Erik Prince wants to do for the military — and the fact that they pour huge sums of money into these campaigns, including the Trump campaign. But Erik Prince is a very brilliant and evil sort of genius, very forward-thinking. And at times, he has sort of talked about how leftists and the Democrats in Congress ruined Blackwater.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Erik Prince:\u003c/strong> You know, the anti-war Left went after the troops in Vietnam. This time, it was easy to go after contractors, the kind of work we did, that my family background, all the rest made it a very easy target.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Scooby-Doo Villain:\u003c/strong> And I’d of done it, too, if you kids hadn’t of come along.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And it’s almost like a Scooby-Doo type thing, where it’s like, I would have gotten away with it if it wasn’t for those rascally kids. But the guy has an incredible ability to survive. I mean, you know, if the apocalypse comes, which they all think it will, I think we’re gonna have: Radio Shack, cockroaches, and Erik Prince. They’ll all somehow survive the apocalypse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> Great…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Betsy Reed, thanks for being with us again on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Betsy Reed is the Editor-in-Chief of The Intercept. We turn now to Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. Schakowsky was a long-time member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and she’s been perhaps the most dogged investigator of Erik Prince and Blackwater over the past decade in the U.S. Congress. She’s joining us now from Washington, D.C. Jan Schakowsky, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Jan Schakowsky:\u003c/strong> Happy to be here. Thanks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your reaction to this latest news in the Washington Post that Blackwater founder Erik Prince held secret talks in the Seychelles to establish a Trump/Putin backchannel?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> Nothing about this report is a surprise to me. Erik Prince is exactly the kind of person I think that the Trump administration would want to invite into the inner circle, or at least allow in the inner circle, not just because his family has done something like a million dollars to Trump, and he himself a quarter of a million dollars. But he is the kind of un-vetted, unscrupulous kind of person that seems to fit very nicely, especially for the kinds of operations that they want done. And of course, its now been said that it’s a complete fabrication, it’s fake, it’s not true. But if you look at the history of Erik Prince, and even ongoing investigations, it seems, as you’ve reported — I thank you for that — that the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are looking at some of the activities of Erik Prince, his brokering military services to foreign governments. I mean this is a mercenary that liked to disguise himself during the Iraq War as some sort of an uber-patriot. He was doing it because he loves the United States of America. Well, it seems that he’s given up even that facade working with the Chinese, with the Sudanese. And now, we find out, sending — facilitating backchannels to Russia, another Russia connection. So, you know, when I saw that, it was like, yup, that’s Erik Prince.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, let me ask you. You know, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who himself has a very colorful past, is very close to Erik Prince — he at one point compared Erik Prince in a positive way to Colonel Oliver North, who was of course at the center of the Iran-Contra scandal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Colonel Oliver North:\u003c/strong> The effort to conduct these covert operations was made in such a way that our adversaries would not have knowledge of them, or that we could deny American association with them, or the association of this government with those activities. And that is not wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what I wanted to ask you about is if, as we’ve reported, and now the Washington Post is confirming – if Erik Prince is in this role as a sort of shadow adviser to Donald Trump, while at the same time doing business with the Chinese government and other foreign government, including – you know, this guy was a former Navy SEAL who’s had secret security clearances, and has been able to walk the halls of the CIA. What are your concerns about Erik Prince serving in this kind of unofficial shadow capacity advising the President of the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> Well, if you look at Oliver North, and you look at the Iran-Contra scandal, that’s exactly what we ought to be scrupulously avoiding, trying to not have people who, I think, are quite aptly associated or at least compared to Oliver North. This is the kind of thing that I think is going to erode all of our foreign policy, further degrade — you know, the Trump administration’s done a pretty good job so far —but further degrade that trust that any foreign country, any ally can have in the United States of America dealing with countries that are not our allies in ways that are just meant to enrich Erik Prince and his new company. And he should be absolutely barred from doing any kind of business with the government, particularly while he is already under surveillance for things like money laundering, etc. So, I mean, it’s just outrageous, not surprising, but should be – the light should be shown on him, and I’m so happy that you’re part of that effort and have been.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Congresswoman Schakowsky, I also want to just remind people of something that we at The Intercept reported a year ago. And that involved Erik Prince’s new company, the sort of new iteration of Blackwater called Frontier Services Group. In January of 2014, Erik Prince officially went into business with the Chinese government’s largest state-owned investment firm. It’s called the CITIC Group, and they created Frontier Services Group, which is now based in Hong Kong. And what we reported is that U.S. intelligence picked up a money-laundering scheme that involved Erik Prince and a bank in Macau. But also, the U.S. intelligence is aware that Prince has met with members of China’s intelligence and security services as part of his business. Donald Trump is meeting with the Chinese leader at Mar-a-Lago this week. What about this issue of Erik Prince doing security business with the Chinese government, including helping them extract minerals in East Africa, while at the same time shadow advising Trump, and Trump now meeting with the leader of China?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> First of all, I think that this is very concerning for the United States. I don’t know if this would come up — probably not — at a meeting that the President would be having with the head of China. But he is doing business with, as you report, this CITIC Group, the Chinese government’s largest state-owned investment firm. And if Donald Trump were somebody who wanted to protect the interests of the United States of America, he would discourage any kind of a relationship with someone like Erik Prince.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and Erik Prince also is pitching this idea to the European Union, and it involves also some shady figures in Libya that he could help create a private anti-refugee force that could stop the flow of people who are essentially fleeing not only the civil wars in that region, but the brutality of ISIS. And he actually openly wrote an op-ed for the Financial Times recently making the case for a privatized counter-refugee force. And, you know, this is not a guy that seems to be worried that he’s gonna get locked up by the United States government, particularly since Donald Trump is president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> You know, and of course, with the massacre in Nisour Square in Iraq, there were Blackwater employees who were held responsible. Erik Prince has always been able to slither away, even slither out of the United States when the heat came on him, and to escape any kind of accountability. And especially, really, he’s gonna target refugees? You know, he will do business. He will make money on either side, maybe even on both sides of conflicts. And now, developing his own low-cost Air Force with re-equipped airplanes that can drop small bombs and get involved in small wars around the world. A very, very dangerous individual that makes the Trump administration even more frightening — that they would have association with him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you think should be done regarding this relationship and the details that have been emerging over the past months of Erik Prince and Donald Trump? What should Congress do? What should the FBI do? What are you calling for, or what do you think should happen right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> I think that even publicly, members like myself can raise some questions that the intelligence community needs to get answers. You know if they have been monitoring, as it seems, Erik Prince for a long time, what have they found? What are the things that he is engaged in? What are the things that the American people need to know about his activities, and how can we disassociate ourselves from him? And should he be held accountable by the United States for some of the activities that he’s been engaged in?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, because we’re now all sort of living in this reality television show that is the Trump administration, and people are watching the Spicer news briefings like it’s like “Keeping up With the Kardashians”. And part of the reason why the Erik Prince story had gotten so much attention is the mention of the word “Russia”. But as you and I both know, that’s one tiny part to probe in this. It’s that Donald Trump basically has his — a new version of Oliver North that has access to the West Wing of the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> Right. Apparently, is close to Steve Bannon, is close to the Vice President, Mike Pence, and, you know, is probably the kind of voice that the likes of Bannon and probably Miller would really welcome there. And the only way that we can fight back is if we make sure that the intelligence community is looking at it, that the Justice Department is looking at it, and that there is some transparency on what is going on. Because increasingly, I feel that the American people, as much as they may be enjoying this unfolding mystery kind of “House of Cards” that’s real, that there’s this really, really disturbing quality to it. I think more and more Americans are disturbed. And yes, it’s been focusing on Russia, but this with Erik Prince goes way beyond that, and I think more significantly beyond that, at least in terms of Erik Prince’s involvement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, thank you very much for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JS:\u003c/strong> Thank you. Thank you, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jan Schakowksy represents Illinois’s 9\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> District in the U.S. Congress.

And today, Martin Luther King has a monument in his honor in Washington, D.C. There’s a national holiday named for him. And King’s story, a very watered down, whitewashed version of his life, is taught in schools across this country. It’s taught in schools around the world. But what is almost never discussed about Martin Luther King, Jr. was the truly radical nature of his politics, and how he was completely rejected, scorned, and ridiculed by the news media, eventually by the broader civil rights movement, and also, toward the end of his life, by large swaths of the black population in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dr. King’s speeches, for many, many years, contained revolutionary, anti-imperialist ideas and visions, but those are never quoted. King described his own economic outlook as being rooted in democratic socialism. 50 years ago this week, on April 4\u003csup>, \u003c/sup>1967, Martin Luther King delivered a very historic speech at New York City’s Riverside Church. It was titled, “Beyond Vietnam.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:\u003c/strong> If we continue, there would be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in Vietnam.

Even the FBI, which many people believe was directly involved with King’s assassination — the FBI tweeted this week, supposedly in honor of King’s life, work, and commitment to justice. Now, given the fact that the FBI systemically harassed and threatened Martin Luther King while he was alive, and that campaign was led by J. Edgar Hoover, for whom the FBI building is named — I find that tweet sickening. Joining me now to discuss the legacy of Martin Luther King and that last year of his life is Tavis Smiley. He is the host of a PBS show that bears his name. Tavis is doing an entire week of special programming on his show on PBS. I encourage everyone to check it out. He is dissecting various aspects of King’s “Beyond Vietnam” speech. And in addition to hosting his television and radio show, Tavis is also the co-author of a very, very important book on the last year of Dr. King’s life. It’s called “Death of a King: The Real Story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Final Year”. Tavis Smiley, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tavis Smiley:\u003c/strong> Jeremy, an honor to be on. Thanks, my friend.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Tavis, most people, when Dr. King is celebrated in society or talked about, almost exclusively reference the “I Have a Dream” speech. Can you lay out how Dr. King came to give the “Beyond Vietnam” speech and the significance?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> First of all, Jeremy, it is the most controversial, the most unheralded, and I think the most powerful speech that Dr. King ever made. And it’s worth being studied by anyone who really wants to understand who Dr. King really was. I think it’s true for all of us, Jeremy, that we get to know who we are in the dark, desolate hours of our lives. And if you don’t know Dr. King in this last year from April 4th, ’67 to April 4th, ’68, then you don’t see him in the dark desolate hours to really come to appreciate who he was. And so, to your question, in ’63, he’s giving the “I Have a Dream” speech. And I think people think King only gave one speech in his whole life, Jeremy. And they act like this speech only had one line in it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MLK:\u003c/strong> That my four little children will one day live in a nation where they’ll not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> That’s all we seem to know from that one speech. Even that speech had some more subversive truths in that that America wasn’t really ready to handle. But it’s nothing compared to this “Beyond Vietnam” speech. So, here’s the quick answer to your question. In ’63, King is talking about integration. By the time he gets to the “Beyond Vietnam” speech, he is saying publicly that he fears that for all the work he and others have done to fight for integration, these are his words — he fears that “we have integrated into a burning house.” By the time he gets to this speech, he’s preparing to preach a sermon entitled “Why America May Go to Hell.” In so many ways, King grows from 1963 to 1967, but this is the speech Vincent Harding — the late, great Vincent Harding who helped craft the speech — said he believes, Jeremy, that this speech is the speech that put the target on Dr. King’s back. And so literally, he gives this speech coming out against the war in Vietnam in New York City at the Riverside Church, April 4\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, ’67. He opens the speech, as you well know, by saying —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MLK:\u003c/strong> I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> He goes on to say that sometimes silence is betrayal, and then he refers to his task that evening, to really just upbraid America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MLK:\u003c/strong> We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society, and sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia, which they had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem.

And it caught him a year to the day, almost to the very hour that he gave the speech. And it kills him April 4, 1968.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How was this speech covered in the news media in 1967 when King delivered these remarks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. It got as much coverage as the “I Have a Dream” speech, and quite frankly, more in some ways when you consider that the “I Have a Dream” speech was covered, of course, live on the Mall by all the national media. Back then, Dr. King was recommended to put out an embargoed copy of his speech the night before he gave it so that the media would have time to wrestle with it and be able to cover it, in unison, the next day. King wasn’t crazy about that idea. For some reason, in his gut, he just wasn’t settled with it, but they said, “Martin, if you’re going to give the speech” — and nobody on his staff wanted him to give the speech except for James Bevel — everybody thought it was a horrible idea for a lot of reasons we can talk about later. But they said, “If you’re going to give it and you want coverage for it, let’s put out an embargoed copy the night of the speech.” They did that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To answer your question, Jeremy, what that means is the very next day, every media outlet in the country had a copy of the speech with which to put around his neck and hang him, essentially, the next day. And that’s exactly what happened. There was no Fox News Channel around then. But you didn’t need the Fox News Channel because the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek, all the so-called liberal news went in on Dr. King and said things like: “Dr. King has outlived his usefulness to his own people.” They said things like, “He is no longer of a service to his people.” I mean they just upbraided him the next day for this speech precisely because and particularly because they did not like one unique reference that he used when he referred to, as you know, Jeremy, America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MLK:\u003c/strong> And I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today — my own government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> That’s a bold statement for a negro, even a negro with a Nobel Peace Prize, to stand up and tell America, “You, America, are the great purveyor of violence in the world.” They did not like that. They didn’t take it kindly, and they made him pay a heavy price the very next day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Because you’ve studied this speech so deeply and on a scholarly level, what was the thrust of the argument that King was making for his opposition to not only the Vietnam War, but also asserting that the United States government was the greatest purveyor of violence in the world at that time?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> He wanted to make the case of our involvement in this conflict, involvement in other conflicts around the world. He didn’t want to just say, “America is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world” and not back up his point. So, he referenced any number of conflicts that we’d been engaged in and involved with, indeed, around the world. So, he made his case to back up that particular assessment. But then he goes on, as you know, to advance this notion of what he called the triple treat facing our democracy. And he basically says to America, “You, America, are simply going to lose your democracy if you don’t get serious about the triple threat facing our nation.” That triple threat: Racism, poverty, and militarism. Racism, poverty, and militarism. And I daresay, here we are, 50 years later, still trying to wrestle with that subversive truth that King told 50 years ago that still threatens to tear this democracy apart: Racism, poverty, and militarism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to ask you about the monument to King in D.C. and whether you believe that that monument would exist if the depths of King’s opposition to imperialism, his embrace of a sort of democratic socialist economic philosophy — if we really understood King beyond just, oh, he was the great leader that wanted black children and white children to play together in peace, do you think that the real King would get a monument in Washington, D.C.?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> In a word: No. There’d be no monument. And I’ll go further than that. There’d be no monument. There’d be no federal holiday. His name would not appear on schools and streets and libraries and just about anything else. The absolute answer is no. The unequivocal answer is no. The truth of the matter is, for Dr. King here this week, on the anniversary of this speech, and he, you know, volunteered to show up at a number of places in our society to kind of deconstruct this speech or kind of look back on it 50 years later, he wouldn’t have an audience. I’ve often joked that — around the King holiday that we celebrate every year — if Dr. King showed up backstage and said, “I’m Dr. King and I’m here, I’m back, and I’d like to go on the program in honor of me today. I figure can get on my own program. Can I get on the program to say a few words?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Well, Dr. King, what do you want to talk about?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“I want to talk about racism and poverty and militarism. I want to talk about how Barack Obama, who I certainly would have voted for, you know, had a drone program on steroids. I want to talk about how he increased the military industrial complex. I want to talk about how he dropped more drones and killed more innocent women and children than George Bush, his predecessor, did. I want to talk about how poverty is threatening our very democracy, and now it’s a matter of national security. I want to talk about how racism is still the most intractable issue in this country.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If Martin showed up and wanted to give that kind of critique, that negro couldn’t get onstage at his own celebration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] When Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; he invoked the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. And in a way, he sort of used King as a jumping board to explain why it’s necessary for him to engage in these militaristic imperial powers — actions around the globe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> We must begin by acknowledging a hard truth. We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations acting individually or in concert will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified. I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago. “Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem. It merely creates new and more complicated ones.” As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King’s life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of nonviolence. I know there’s nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naive in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King. But as a head of state, sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And also, you and Dr. Cornel West became almost instantly persona non grata with the Obama crowd almost immediately after his election because of your political critique of his policies, the people he was surrounding himself with, and the vision that he was outlining for the United States. So, those two things: Obama invoking King’s name in his Nobel speech, and also then the price you paid for your critiques of President Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> On the Nobel speech, it was disappointing, to say the least. I have had enough of people using Dr. King as a prop when they want to advance certain notions, and then giving him the Heisman, you know, stiff-arming him, if you will, when they want to advance this notion of so-called just war. What that bust of Dr. King that sat in the Oval Office during the Obama years, what that bust must have been whispering to Obama in the midnight hour, when he was working late in the Oval Office. When it was just the bust of Dr. King and Obama in that room together, in that office together, what must that bust have been whispering to him on various occasions? Dr. King, although proud of the opportunity for black men to be president, would have been a truth teller, as he always was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And if you think my critique on Obama was tough, you’ve gotta go back and read literally what Dr. King said about and to Lyndon Johnson. It’s mind-boggling to see in print the kinds of things, the kinds of critique that Dr. King had against Lyndon Johnson about first of all, calling for a war on poverty, and then wasting all the resources on this war in Vietnam. King said that budgets are, “Moral documents. Mr. president, a budget is a moral document.” He did not hold back going after Lyndon Johnson. And so, my commentary about Obama, comparatively speaking, was almost tame. I am sick and tired — I’m like Fannie Lou Hamer, “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired” — of hearing this argument that Dr. King wouldn’t understand Hezbollah. That Dr. King wouldn’t understand Hamas. That Dr. King wouldn’t understand ISIL or ISIS. What the heck do you think he was up against every single day during his life? First of all, he was shot in the head. He was assassinated. But every day, there were lynchings of black people, and maimings and other killings of black people, cops shooting black people in cities all across this country. Martin dealt with this every single day. He preached far too many eulogies in his own lifetime. And it’s as if we don’t want to accept, Jeremy, that American terrorism, that domestic American terrorism, is no different than terrorism anywhere else. And so, every time we advance this notion that Martin wouldn’t understand these modern-day wars, these modern-day struggles because he just didn’t live in this era, it belittles what he was up against, and it — quite frankly, it doesn’t do justice. It doesn’t tell the truth, put another way, about the American story, about the American horror story of racism and lynching, etc., etc. So, I just get tired of making those arguments. For me, you speak the truth. You seek it, you speak it, you stand on it, you stay with it, and the consequences are what they are. So, I don’t cry about that. There’s nothing I’ve ever said or done that I regret. I just gotta tell the truth as best I can.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know if you Google around and you say, “MLK intervention Syria,” “MLK bombing Iraq,” you can find some prominent political figures that make these arguments. “Well, King would have supported going in to stop the killing in Syria. Well, King would have supported a regime change to get rid of Qaddafi.” And the point you’re making, which I think is so important to remind people of, is that King himself, was facing down against very well-armed, very well-organized terrorist factions, and did not call for the United States government to drop a bomb on the Ku Klux Klan. His response was, “My body and my ideas, that’s my weapon, and I use them nonviolently in between the state-sanctioned murder that we are facing and our own survival.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, King was fond of saying that slogans are not solutions. Slogans are not solutions. And so, you can try to deconstruct nonviolence 18 ways from Sunday. But King is the only one that had a winning record. Every conflict that he engaged in where nonviolence was a strategy, he won. I mean, every conflict he was ever involved in, from: Montgomery Bus Boycott, Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, just run the list. His strategy of nonviolence worked. He never lost a battle except his own life. And even then, they killed his body, but they didn’t kill his spirit. Here we are 50 years later still talking about the brother. So even that battle, he didn’t lose. And so, he would again say that slogans are not solutions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let me put it this way. My friend Cornel West, who you referenced earlier, Jeremy, in this conversation, came up with a term some years ago that I’m still tickled by all these years later. And what you’ve just described about people taking King’s words and twisting them like a pretzel, Dr. King calls the Santa Claus-ification of Martin King. Only Cornel West could come up with that term, the Santa Claus-ification of Martin King. And his point simply is that the farther we get away from Martin’s real life, real time existence, people want to take his words and twist ‘em. They want to tame him. They want to defang him. They want to deodorize him. They don’t want to deal with the subversive truth, I repeat, of what he was saying, and about the power of nonviolence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Describe what happened in the last year of Martin Luther King’s life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> So, the media turned on him first. After that, he got disinvited to the LBJ White House. LBJ would continue to meet for the last year of King’s life with other black leaders, but they would dis-invite Martin to the White House. Black leaders turned on him. Roy Wilkins, the head of the NAACP, Whitney Young, the head of the Urban League, the most famous black journalist of the day, Carl T. Rowan — all those leaders came out publicly against him. I loved and respected Thurgood Marshall, but I can’t even repeat on this program the language that Thurgood Marshall used to describe Dr. King. Yes, that Thurgood Marshall. Then the last poll taken in his life, the Harris poll, found, in the last year of his life, that almost three-quarters of the American people, three-quarters — thought he was irrelevant. Almost 60 percent of his own people, black people, thought he was persona non grata.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He was disinvited to speak in black churches. They would not run his op-eds in the newspapers. He had trouble getting his last book published. He could not raise money for his organization. He dies broke, and Harry Belafonte has to pay for his funeral.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When King stood on that balcony in Memphis and took that bullet to the head, he had no idea that all these years later, there’d be monuments and schools and streets and libraries bearing his name. But at the end of the day, for that entire year, the beautiful part of the story is, with all the hell that he caught, he never backed up. He didn’t take one step back, Jeremy, not even to gain momentum. He kept telling the truth. He kept organizing that Poor Peoples’ Campaign. He would not give into the threats of Hoover, or the FBI, or the White House. Martin kept telling the truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Tavis, what was the combination of factors that led to the statistics that you’re citing about believing that King was irrelevant? What caused that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> What caused it was, again, he was telling the truth that we just couldn’t handle. They didn’t like the fact that he, at the height of war, was coming across – being portrayed as anti-American. They labeled him, as you well know, a communist. Inside the black community, his constituency was in trouble because the bourgeois elite negroes were made at him for getting into a tete-a-tete with Lyndon Johnson. I mean, Johnson was the best president that negroes had had in the White House since Lincoln freed the slaves. Because he had passed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, the bourgeois elite Negroes didn’t like Martin getting into it with our president, who was being good to us on a domestic agenda. Their thing was, “man, forget this war in Vietnam. This white man is being good to us. He’s advancing our cause on the domestic front. Do not piss off the president, Martin.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the bourgeois elite negroes were made at him for that. To the younger blacks, they though Martin was passé. They wanted Stokely Carmichael and Black Power. They wanted Huey P. Newton and H. Rap Brown and Bobby Seale. So, within his own constituency, his own community, he was, again, persona non grata. The black churches were too afraid to have him come in. And my point is that King was so toxic that black leaders didn’t want to be seen in public with him. Too many people uncomfortable. That’s why I said repeatedly that sometimes the truth can be unsettling, un-housing, and subversive — too subversive, too hot for some people to handle. But in the end, we discovered that Martin was right. They just couldn’t tell – they just couldn’t handle it back then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> People, pick up the book “Death of a King”. It’s a phenomenal read, and it’s taken on, I think, a very raw and real urgency because of what we’re facing in the world right now, with both the wars abroad and the economic and racial situation inside of the United States. And also, tune into Tavis Smiley’s program on PBS all this week for a variety of voices breaking down this incredibly momentous and important speech that Dr. King gave 50 years ago this week, “Beyond Vietnam.” Tavis Smiley, thank you for all you do, and thank you for being our guest here on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> My great delight. You stay strong in your work and witness, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, you too. Thank you, Tavis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> All right, brother.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We end today’s show with another historic speech against war. It was delivered just three days after the 9/11 attacks, by California Congresswoman Barbara Lee. She was on the only member of either house of the U.S. Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force. That was the bill that gave Bush and Cheney this blank check to wage war on the world. And it had no definable end game, and still is on the books to this day. Barbara Lee’s speech was a prophetic one and a brave one. And she came under tremendous attacks and threats as a result of it. And I have to say; I believe that, like with King’s speech about the war in Vietnam, history is proving Barbara Lee right. This is the story of that speech, in her own words.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Congresswoman Barbara Lee:\u003c/strong> It set the stage for what we know now as perpetual war. It said basically the president, and any president, has the authority to use force forever, as long as he or she can justify a connection to 9/11. Now, that was overly broad, it was unconstitutional, and it was wrong. Now, I didn’t come to this decision lightly, because I knew that there would be only a few who would vote no given the anger and the real despair and the frustration and the depression of the country at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George W. Bush:\u003c/strong> The nation stands with the good people of New York City and New Jersey and Connecticut as we mourn the loss of thousands of our citizens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Audience:\u003c/strong> We can’t hear you!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GWB:\u003c/strong> I can hear you! [Crowd cheering] I can hear you!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BL:\u003c/strong> But I knew that I had to vote no because this was something that went totally counter to what our Constitution requires. And also, given the fact that we have to fight, and I’m not looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. I mean we have to fight terrorism. But we can’t engage in actions that are going to make our country less secure and create more anger and more war around the world. But those were some very terrible and difficult days. And I decided at the prayer service at the National Cathedral that I was gonna vote no. The minister, Nathan Baxter, in his prayer, he said, “Let us not become the evil who we deplore.” And at that moment, I knew then that there was no way my conscience would allow me to vote for a resolution that would set the stage for perpetual war, endless war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Minister Nathan Baxter:\u003c/strong> Let us also pray for divine wisdom, as our leaders consider the necessary actions for national security, wisdom of the grace of God that as we act, we not become the evil we deplore.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Barbara Lee addresses Congress, 9/14/2001:\u003c/strong> I want to thank our ranking member and my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, members, I rise today really with a very heavy heart, one that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones that were killed and injured this week. Only the most foolish and the most callous would not understand the grief that has really gripped our people and millions across the world. This unspeakable act on the United States has really forced me, however, to rely on my moral compass, my conscience, and my God for direction. September 11\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet I am convinced, that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States. This is a very complex and complicated matter. Now this resolution will pass, although we all know that the president can wage a war even without it. However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our country is in a state of mourning. Some of us must say, “Let’s step back for a moment. Let’s just pause, just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.” Now, I have agonized over this vote. But I came to grips with it today, and I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful yet very beautiful memorial service. As a member of the clergy so eloquently said, “As we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore.” Thank you, and I yield the balance of my time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Speaker:\u003c/strong> Chairwoman’s time has expired. Gentleman from Illinois —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BL:\u003c/strong> I received many, many, many death threats. I received many email and phone calls threatening me and my family. It was very — I think very insightful for me, even though it was a very different time. But to see how people really don’t understand that central to democracy is the right to dissent. And that we have the right to exercise our First Amendment rights. We don’t have to go along with the program or with any administration, if in fact, we believe that it’s wrong. So while, yes, we needed unity, and we needed to let the world know that we weren’t going to accept any acts of terrorism against the United States, we certainly should do it in a way that doesn’t make people afraid, nor make people believe that if we don’t vote for something that’s gonna make us less secure that we’re committing acts of treason or a traitor. And that’s what I was called over and over again. But that blank check is still on the books. And now with this president, who claims that he loves war, and he has a shoot first policy, you know, I’m very fearful that this resolution, unless repealed, will give him the authority to do whatever he decides to do one day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Congresswoman Barbara Lee, of California.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That does it for this week’s show.

This week’s episode of Intercepted will piss off Assad supporters and the Democrats and Republicans fawning over Trump’s newest war. Former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who recently met with Bashar al-Assad in Damascus, questions the official story on the chemical weapons attack. Murtaza Hussain explains what Assad would stand to gain by using chemical weapons. And we hear from Maher Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian engineer who was kidnapped at JFK airport by U.S. operatives after 9/11 and rendered to Syria where he was tortured and interrogated by Assad’s intelligence agents. Arar explains why he is against Assad and U.S. military intervention in Syria. All that and a bucket of the media stupidity that is always on hand to ogle over the awesome, beautiful missiles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Westminster Dog Show Announcer:\u003c/strong> Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the seven group winners competing for Best in Show at the –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MSNBC Anchor Brian Williams:\u003c/strong> We see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two U.S. Navy vessels in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Trump:\u003c/strong> Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There’s almost nothing that brings the warmongerers, the hawks, the elites from both the Democratic and Republican parties together more than a cruise missile strike. Over the past week, we’ve seen the phenomenal transformation of Democratic Party heavyweights who just days ago were screaming from the mountaintops about the Trump administration effectively being a sleeper cell for Vladimir Putin and the Russians. We’ve seen them now transform into, at least on this issue, lemmings heaping praise on Trump for his decision to rain cruise missiles down on a Syrian military base that, by the way, was back in operation almost immediately after the strikes ended. Now, that strike, of course, was ordered by Donald Trump, supposedly in response to the chemical weapon attack in Idlib province that the U.S. is saying definitely Bashar al-Assad’s forces conducted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are reports that suggest that somewhere between 30 or 80-plus people were killed in that attack. And the pictures are horrifying. Now, it may very well be the case that as the U.S. says, so it is. It’s completely plausible that this was a chemical weapons attack. I personally believe Bashar al-Assad is a butcher and a war criminal. I wouldn’t put it past him to order a chemical weapons strike. I wouldn’t. But, as we’ve seen time and again throughout the history of U.S. wars, the public is often not presented with evidence, not to mention solid evidence that what those in power, the administration, other powerful individuals — that what they’re alleging is actually true, or that it’s the full truth. As journalists, our job is to hold those in power accountable, whether they’re Democrats, Republicans, or some other iteration. And part of that means demanding evidence, particularly when it means war or military strikes, when people are going to die. Not just U.S. soldiers, but also innocent people on the other end of our missiles and our bombs and our guns. Everyone knows the old adage, “Trust, but verify.” For journalists, that shouldn’t be the policy. It should be “Distrust and verify.” The great I.F. Stone put it best: “All governments lie.” And they lie to justify wars and aggression.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>1846: Mexico invaded the U.S. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>1898: Spain blew up the U.S.S. Maine in the Havana Harbor of Cuba. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. opposed fascism in Europe leading up to World War II. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>1964: U.S. warships attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin during Vietnam. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>1990: Iraqi soldiers were ripping Kuwaiti babies from incubators and throwing them on the floor to die. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>WMDs in Iraq. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Iraq worked with al Qaeda. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We don’t collect any personal data on Americans, on millions of Americans. Lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you know what? Many of these lies took lives — lots of lives. Millions of lives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now, the Trump administration is pulling out a classic in American war selling: Compare enemy X to Hitler. It doesn’t matter if the new Hitler used to be our ally. Enemy X is now Hitler. Panamanian dictator and CIA narcotrafficker Manuel Noriega, when he outlived U.S. interests, he was just like Hitler. Saddam Hussein, after he fell out of favor with the United States and no longer was a worthy ally to kill Iranians? Oh, he was Hitler. Slobodan Miloševi?, who had all sorts of deals with the Clinton administration before the disintegration of Yugoslavia began? Oh, he has to be Hitler too. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, he took it to another level, though.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> We didn’t use chemical weapons in World War II, you know. Someone as despicable as Hitler, who didn’t even sink to the — to using chemical weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter:\u003c/strong> “Hitler didn’t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons.” What did you mean by that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS:\u003c/strong> I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no — he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing. I mean, there was clearly — I understand your point. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m just gonna leave Sean Spicer’s insane ahistoric comments right there, right where they are, and let them speak for themselves. Throughout history, those who have demanded evidence to support these assertions that lead to wars, they’ve been harassed, scorned, vilified, crucified in the news media and by the powerful elites of both political parties. Some have been accused of being traitors or siding with the enemy. And so many people, so many of the people who have a PhD in being wrong all the time, they’re praising Trump right now for his cruise missile strike on Syria. Hillary Clinton, who supported the Iraq War, who promoted the idea that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction — Hillary Clinton and almost every prominent Congressional Democrat…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chuck Schumer:\u003c/strong> Making sure that Assad knows when he commits such despicable atrocities, he will pay a price, is the right thing to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Leaders of liberal think tanks…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nicholas Kristof:\u003c/strong> In this case, I think that this was the right thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Fareed Zakaria:\u003c/strong> I think Donald Trump became president of the United States. I think this was actually a big moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Thomas Friedman:\u003c/strong> I would be doing everything I could on every front to increase our leverage. Because in the Middle East, if you’re trying to do diplomacy without leverage, you’re playing baseball without a bat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Have joined along with famed neocons like William Kristol and hawks like John McCain and Lindsey Graham…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sen. John McCain:\u003c/strong> It’s the beginning of a departure from the failed policies of the last eight years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sen. Lindsey Graham:\u003c/strong> The only Constitutional requirement that exists regarding war is for Congress to put the nation in a declared state of war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And they’re all back together again cheering this war on. Now, given this history, shouldn’t we seek out dissenting voices and listen to what they have to say while the decisions are being made, while history is unfolding in front of us? Dissidents are often right. Not always, but dissidents often turn out to be right. The only member of Congress that is questioning the official narrative about the Syria chemical weapons attack is Hawaii Congresswoman and combat veteran Tulsi Gabbard.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard:\u003c/strong> We, as the American people, should be concerned when any president of the United States launches an illegal and unconstitutional military strike against a foreign government. This is something that Congress has not authorized, and it’s an escalation of a counterproductive regime change war in Syria that our country’s been waging for years. First for many years through the CIA covertly, and now overtly through President Trump’s reckless military strikes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> A few months ago, Tulsi Gabbard visited Syria, and she met with Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. And boy, did the knives come out for Tulsi Gabbard ever since, including those from her own party. And it just intensified when she spoke out against Donald Trump’s cruise missile attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alex Witt:\u003c/strong> Howard, how do you respond to Tulsi Gabbard?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Howard Dean:\u003c/strong> I think it’s outrageous. There’s a long, well-known history, both in our intelligence community, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders. Every single one of these agencies has said that Assad is using chemical weapons. He’s a barbarian. He’s murdered half a million of his own people. I can’t imagine how you could make a statement like that, especially being on the Foreign Relations Committee. I can’t imagine what could possibly have been going through her head.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> So, you said that Gabbard should not be in Congress, that this is a disgrace — all she’s asking for is proof, though. Is that a bad thing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HD:\u003c/strong> If you’re on the Foreign Relations Committee, and you haven’t seen the proof in the last five-and-a-half years that Assad is a butcher and used chemical weapons, there’s something the matter with you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I’m sure I’m gonna get attacked for this, and frankly, I don’t care. But I believe that especially right now, we need to act upon the principle that we need to see evidence, that we need to question deeply decisions that lead to war or military action, especially given the fact that we have an expanding number of U.S. wars being waged, both covert and overt, around the globe today. So, we’re going to focus our entire show today on Syria. And we’re going to hear conflicting perspectives. We’re going to hear very different points of view on what happened in Syria and what should happen in Syria. And some of these views get almost no airplay in the corporate media.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We begin the show with a politician whose entire career has embodied the necessity of dissent, former Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich. He voted against the Patriot Act. He opposed the 1999 Kosovo bombing by Bill Clinton. He opposed the Iraq War, the drone wars. He’s one of the few members of Congress who’s voted against Congressional resolutions supporting Israel. He opposed the Obama administration’s war in Libya, and he has consistently opposed support for U.S. client states around the world. Dennis served eight terms in the U.S. Congress, and he ultimately lost his seat after a redistricting. Dennis Kucinich has run twice for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. And lately, he’s been in the news because of this: Back in 2013, Kucinich met with Bashar al-Assad in Damascus, and he interviewed Assad. And Kucinich, during that interview, pressed Assad exactly on this issue, on his commitment to give up chemical weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dennis Kucinich:\u003c/strong> Can you tell us now, do you have chemical weapons or don’t you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bashar al-Assad:\u003c/strong> Of course, when we joined the treaty last week, it means that we have, and we said that, so it’s not a secret anymore.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> So, as far as the American people, you will agree that you do have a stockpile of chemical weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BA:\u003c/strong> Well, that’s why we joined the international agreement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> So you would say that President Obama, then, can trust you to follow through?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BA:\u003c/strong> I don’t think that President Obama should trust me first. The Syrian people should trust me. Not President Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, a few months ago, Kucinich accompanied Tulsi Gabbard on her visit to Syria, and once again, they met Bashar al-Assad. Dennis Kucinich joins me now. Dennis, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> Thank you very much. Great to join you, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you believe that this was a chemical weapons attack by Assad’s air force or military on April 4\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> No, and here’s why. Because Syria had been winning on the ground. They had a major battle that was a turnaround moment in Aleppo. And it would go against everything that makes sense militarily and politically to engage in a chemical weapons attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you believe that Assad has ever used chemical weapons during his time as president of Syria?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> I don’t believe so, but I have to tell you, you know, it’s up for debate. So my concern is this. The rush to judgment and the absolute refusal to ask for an independent inquiry to promote an independent investigation, to demand access to the forensics of it, raises questions about whether there was an agenda and whether or not this was in fact a false flag attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And if it was a false flag attack, what would the agenda be and who is most likely to have conducted it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> I don’t know that there was. But I certainly have to tell you that based on all the circumstances you can’t rule it out. I mean the gas attack was horrible, terrible, horrific. And America — you know, American people have a big heart. You’ve got elements that are aware of the sensitivities of the American people, and if they can try to prey on that and suck our country into a broader participation in a war, they’ll do it. So I think that, you know, you have to go back to 2013. That gas attack was used to try to draw the U.K. into bombing Syria. Their parliament said no. We have to look at timing. In 2013, there were weapons inspectors in the vicinity, which would make a gas attack by the government crazy. And this time, 2017, Syria had ISIS on the back foot. Talks have been proceeding to try to end the war. It just makes no sense at all. And if something doesn’t make military sense or political sense, you just have to ask, you know, is there some other process going on that is intended to develop a “Wag the Dog” scenario that draws countries in based on an emotional response to what appears to be a horrific attack?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, you’re no stranger to standing alone in the Congress in opposition to otherwise popular militaristic policies. But on this issue of the chemical weapons, the entire political establishment seems to be quickly — seems to have quickly reached a consensus that this is a fact, that chemical weapons were used. And you have a number of organizations, Bellingcat and others, that analyzed the reporting of Sy Hersch and the MIT analysis that you’re citing, and they say that’s just fallacious science, and it doesn’t hold up. What do you say both to the political supporters of this strike, who are asserting that Assad did use chemical weapons, and also to the people who say, well, we’ve got our own scientists that are saying that that’s just gibberish, that whether it’s Sy Hersh, or you, or Reese Erlich, that you guys are basically just cherry-picking people who are going to be critical of the dominant narrative?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> If the response to the assumption of a chemical weapon attack is a military strike, then certainly, it brings in a higher level of responsibility on the part of America to demand an independent inquiry, to ask for the forensics, to ask for access to the site, to take samples of fragments, to take tissue samples, to interview witnesses, to interview victims. I mean, all these things should have been done. And the fact that there was a rush to judgment and they weren’t done does raise serious questions. If you believe in the rule of law, then civilized nations, as President Trump likes to refer to — do not proceed in a response by violating international law with a military strike. We had an obligation to go in and get the details. And then once that happens, you take that information to the U.N. Security Council, and if necessary, to The Hague to begin prosecution. But none of that was done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I’ll tell you what it reminds me of, Jeremy. You know, yes, I mean, I’m probably one of the few people out there, as well as Tulsi Gabbard, saying, “Look, slow down. We don’t know for sure.” And when the entire Washington establishment is aligned going in the other direction, it kind of reminds me of Iraq. And I did a report in 2002 that looked at all the available intelligence and everything that was on the record, and a few things that weren’t, and there was no proof that Iraq had anything to do with 9/11, al Qaeda’s role in 9/11. Iraq didn’t have the intention of capability of attacking the United States, and didn’t have weapons of mass destruction, as it well turned out. The moment has the same feeling. And it has a similar feeling to Libya where, you know, Qaddafi was going to slaughter people, and that was just a pretext for being able to go after Libya. And what we’re looking really looking here are pretexts, pretexts for running an agenda of regime change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the thing that I think is the most ironic about all this, Saudi Arabia sits with President Trump and approves of his missile strike, while hello, Saudi Arabia, as well as Qatar and Turkey, the U.S.-backed channel and the U.K., have been helping to fund these so-called moderate groups who end up being cousins to ISIS, al Qaeda, and al Nusra. And they’re trying to take over the government of Syria, which, like it or not, is a pluralistic society where people can worship freely. But there’s some obvious incongruities here that do not argue for further military intervention, in any case, and certainly argue for patient, calm, and deep and detailed investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is it about someone like Tulsi Gabbard, or yourself, that you’re immediately assumed to be a nut? And all of the people who’ve been so wrong for so long are welcomed on the airwaves of the most prestigious cable news networks, and written about, and write op-eds in the prestigious journals of our nation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> I’m, of course, very familiar with the scenario that you’re speaking of because, as the person who led the effort against the U.S. march to war in both Iraq and Libya, you know, I understand how one becomes marginalized by challenging the status quo. I ran for president and was treated as a second-rate candidate because I opposed the war. And yet, everyone who was on the stage with me had favored it, and they were wrong. You have to ask the question then, what is America all about? Are we simply about imperium? Are we about expanding the reach of what Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex? When you consider, we have 800 bases in over 130 countries, that we spend more than 10 times what Russia spends annually on the military, that we have a substantial part of the American resources go for war, this machine is a juggernaut that demands to continue to be fed. And anyone who gets in the way, they try to run over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know, when I was a kid growing up in Cleveland, I used to go to Cleveland Indians baseball games, and there was a guy who would walk up and down the steps and the bleachers and go, “Scorecard, scorecard! You can’t tell the players without a scorecard!” You know, in Washington, D.C., you need a scorecard, which includes: Who are the defense contractors who benefit from this? Who’s promoting this in the Pentagon? Who’s promoting it in the State Department? Who’s promoting it at the CIA? And once you have that, you kind of can figure out where this thing is going. And, you know, what about the genesis of war? If the American people really understood, if they really understood that our country has tilted in favor of ISIS and al Qaeda to knock out a government that’s pluralistic; that our country is aligned with Saudi Arabia, which has funded Wahhabis and is part of the axis of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the U.S., and the U.K., who overtly or covertly has been opening up the door for these radical Islamic jihadists’ interests, I think the American people would be in full revolt. But they’re showing pictures of children, who have been gassed, and so, you know, there’s an emotional response, and everybody closes ranks based on that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We’ve talked to reporters who are on the ground there, including some that I’ve known for many, many years, and they are certainly not pro-war or imperialists. And they have a little bit of a different take, particularly since Trump took office, that the United States and Russia were increasingly cooperating, or at least conducting operations that would assist the Syrian government forces in reclaiming territory. Are you saying that you don’t believe that that’s accurate?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> No, I — look, it very well could be a double game. Let me give you an example. I mean we could be doing one thing overtly and another thing covertly. I mean that’s not unusual. Let’s go back to October of 2013, where President Obama sent Secretary Kerry to meet with Foreign Minister Lavrov to come to an agreement to end the fighting in Syria. The news accounts prominently featured unnamed sources from the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency who opposed any agreement with Russia. The CIA did not want to share intelligence, which was one of the things it was agreed to do with Russia, and the Pentagon did not want to share any military intelligence, which was another one of the covenants of the agreement. So there was an agreement, but less than a week later, there was a bombing attack on a Syrian army barracks that killed about a hundred Syrian soldiers. That ended the agreement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, let’s focus attention just for a few seconds on what happened here — that the Pentagon and the CIA basically overruled the president of the United States and the Secretary of State, and decided that they were not going to tolerate any kind of an agreement with Russia. And you’ve got to look at the Deep State potential here. And at the same time, there’s this narrative going forward about Russia stealing the U.S. election, which some of my Democratic friends vying for the remake of a movie about Joe McCarthy are auditioning for a role as acolytes. We are in a quandary with Russia, where we asked them to participate. We bomb a barracks in a country that they have been invited in to protect. And then we blame them for stealing the presidential election. This is a calculated effort to drive a wedge between the United States and Russia so that the permanent war machine just keeps going on and on and on. And if you have peace, they don’t make any money. There’s no money in peace, so they just will precipitate, manipulate. And you’ve got a newer president who’s not experienced. I would imagine that he’s really at the mercy of these forces who are at work in the national security structure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, we don’t even need to go down anything even vaguely smelling of a conspiracy to just state quite clearly what we know to be true, which is that Trump has said that he is going to defer far down the line to the generals. And, you know, the guy spends a tremendous amount of time golfing. He doesn’t seem to be interested in reading his presidential daily briefings. And, I mean, my fundamental concern is that when you’ve got a guy like General Mattis, who’s very hawkish on Iran, you’ve got the mixture of arrogance and fawning over the military in the Oval Office, and you have major world players like the United States and Russia, and secondary players like Iran all in the same battlefield — that we could be looking at sort of unthinkable war scenarios here, or the prospect of something resembling a war between the United States and potentially Russia, if not Russia and Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> Well, that’s my concern right now. When you have the Russian president, Medvedev, warning that the U.S. and Russia could be heading into combat, people ought to take notice. The last time I heard words like that was years ago when the leader of one of the major parties in Russia said that if we blockaded the port of Montenegro, it would be a path — direct path towards nuclear escalation. Now, we’re in Syria. We’ve done military strikes. Our Navy is sending those missiles. We are forcing Russia’s hand. Any miscalculation, any mistake in the air, on the ground, could precipitate a wider conflict. We’re playing in a flash of World War III here. These people who are making decisions for America at this moment do not have the kind of diplomatic experience, which is required to be able to handle a major crisis with another country and with another power. There is no military solution in Syria, and there certainly is no military solution, any differences between the United States and Russia and the United States and Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I believe that Bashar al-Assad is a butcher and a war criminal, and I want him held accountable. As a journalist from the United States, I’ve always viewed my primary job as holding the government of my own country accountable for what it does around the world, and that’s been my position on U.S. involvement in Syria from the beginning. But isn’t Assad also a butcher who has mercilessly killed civilians?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> Well, they’re in a war, so the answer to that question is yes. But on the other hand, you have to ask, if this is all about regime change, what follows? And you have to go into the circumstances under which he is at war. Because if he’s wrong, so is Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey. So is the United States and the U.K., whether it’s covert or overt action, in stirring up a war and opening up a war for people from 90 different countries. Now, how someone defends his country against an attack from 90 different nations, people from 90 different nations who are essentially jihadists, how is he to do that? Is there a nice, neat way to do that? I don’t think so. And I’m not making excuses for anybody. Now, anyone who is defending their country against the kind of onslaught that Syria’s experienced is perforce going to be seen as a brutal dictator. On the other hand, what’s his choice? Does he concede his country to al Qaeda, al Nusra, and ISIS, and world powers who are using Syria as a proxy place for conflict with Iran and Russia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I — the focus now — the demonization of Assad is part and parcel of an effort to push regime change. It’s not about creating peace in Syria. You know, this idea of regime change always ends up being a game of ulterior motives that results in a country that is targeted. People living there are the losers. I’m well aware that there are people who are outside of Syria right now who feel very strongly about removing Assad. But, you know: That’s not our job. And they have to be aware, and they may not be, that this war was accelerated with — from outside, and people had an agenda. And there are radical Islamic jihadis who are being financed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Qatar, Saudi Arabia being one country that was linked to 9/11. Al Qaeda, linked to 9/11. And we’re holding hands with them walking towards Damascus. I don’t think so. You know about dirty wars. This is a dirty war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But one thing for sure: The Syrian people are not the winners in this, at any point. And if there is an attempt at regime change, they will be the losers. And I oppose it wholeheartedly, and I think that inevitably, the people in Syria are going to have to make a decision about who they want to run their country. And at this point, the people I talked to who are opposed to Assad do not want to put their country in the hands of al Qaeda or ISIS. And that’s exactly what they’re looking at, and they know it, and they know their life, which they’re desperate to try to hold onto, would be immeasurably worse. And for the people who are outside the country who don’t like Assad, I mean, I can understand that. But I am not going to endorse the wholesale slaughter of a country, which is going on with all kinds of covert and overt action on the part of big powers who really don’t have any business at all, any legitimate ethical, moral business at all in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Dennis Kucinich, we’ll leave it there. Thank you so much for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DK:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Dennis Kucinich is a former U.S. representative who served eight terms in Congress, and he was twice a candidate for president of the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Russian President Vladimir Putin has now spoken publicly about the chemical weapons attack. During a meeting with the Italian leader in Moscow, Putin charged that this is a false flag operation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Vladimir Putin (Translated):\u003c/strong> We have intelligence showing that such provocations may happen in other parts of Syria as well, including territories south of Damascus. They plan to use some substances and then accuse the Syrian government of using those chemicals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Those are the words of Vladimir Putin. Now, as I said, I would not be shocked if the truth is that this was a merciless use of chemical weapons on April 4\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> in Syria by Bashar al-Assad’s forces. But if that is true, it then begs the question: Why would Assad use chemical weapons? In many ways, conventional munitions can kill more people and faster. I went back and I read the writings of one of the past century’s early supporters of the use of chemical weapons: British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Writing of his support for the use of chemical weapons in India and what is now Iraq, then it was Mesopotamia — Winston Churchill wrote, in 1919: “I am strongly in favor of using poison gas against uncivilized tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gases. Gases can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror, and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.” Those are the words of Winston Churchill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Defense Secretary James Mattis:\u003c/strong> I have personally reviewed the intelligence, and there is no doubt the Syrian regime is responsible for the decision to attack and for the attack itself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, if what we’re told is true, that Assad did in fact order this attack, what would his motive be for doing so? I’m joined now by my colleague Murtaza Hussein. He’s been covering the war in Syria for several years. Maz, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza Hussain:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How would it benefit Bashar al-Assad to use chemical weapons? We don’t know exactly how many people were killed, but there’s estimates between 30 and more than 80 people killed. He could have killed in a far more efficient way with dumb bombs or basic strafing of the areas in Idlib that were hit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Well, there are a number of possible gains you could get from this action. First of all, there’s a strategic perspective. There is a rapprochement, which is happening between the United States and Russia over Syria, especially since Trump came into office. Now, from Assad’s perspective, it’s not necessarily in his benefit that Russia and the U.S. should come to terms with each other in this way, because it’s very likely or very possible that Russia and the U.S. could come to a solution in Syria, which excludes him. Now, Russia, unlike Iran, has always had some communications and relations with the Syrian opposition. He — and he knows this — is an embarrassing proxy for Russia. He has a very tarnished reputation because of the events of the last few years. By taking this action, he has driven a wedge between the U.S. and Russia. So, whereas before, there was a risk starting to emerge where he may be excluded in a political solution which is developed by Russian and American leaders, now, very firmly, Russia’s back in his camp in hostility to the U.S. So, in a sense, he is in a much more favorable political position today than he was a week ago, despite the threats that have been issued to him against — by the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now, secondly, there’s also a very hard strategic reality behind the use of chemical weapons, which is that he has to regain control of a province of Idlib of two million people. His army is in a shambolic state after six — five years of conflict. And he now has the ability to use chemical weapons as a force multiplier to send a message to people in Idlib that we may not have the strength to take back the province in the normal military fashion, but we can use very heinous weapons to demoralize and terrorize people. And now, based on statements by the Trump administration in the past few weeks, he may have thought he had the green light to do that. And it would have sent a very stark message if he had and there had been any response. But even with the U.S. response, his position has still improved in many ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Obama administration, though, made this deal with the Russians and with Syria back in 2013 that Assad was going to allow all of the chemical weapons to be removed from the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> My preference was always to resolve the issue diplomatically. And it turns out, lo and behold, that Syria now is actually removing its chemical weapons that, a few months ago, it denied it even possessed, and has provided a comprehensive list, and they have already begun taking these weapons out of Syria. And although that does not solve the tragic situation inside of Syria, it turns out that removing those chemical weapons will make us safer, and it will make Israel safer. And it will make the Syrian people safer, and it will make the region safer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Are you saying that didn’t happen, and that Assad still maintains a substantial arsenal of chemical weapons?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> It’s very difficult to make the determination right now. I think that the fact that a chemical attack may have happened on the regime’s watch is reason to question whether that deal was implemented, and implemented as fully as the Obama administration claimed. But I also think that after so many years of conflict, it’s very possible that the logistics of the Syrian Army could be in disarray. We saw the same thing with the Iraqis after several years of conflict. They had misplaced chemical weapon stock piles, some of which were found after the U.S. invasion, which is not to say that the WMD claims were true, just that there was such a messy logistical situation that, you know, weapons could exist where it had thought they’d been taken out of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is it possible that there are various entities of the Syrian state that are freelancing, essentially? That, you know, Assad is — I mean, is Assad fully in control of everything that the Syrian Armed Forces do, or is it possible that there are different factions maybe sometimes striking at the same enemies, or of different mindsets on how the so-called enemy should be struck?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> There’s been a warlord-ization of the country in many senses, both on the opposition side, but also on the government side as well too. After the regime first began to grapple with the reality of a very well funded or very vigorous armed opposition, it began to decentralize many of its functions. It helped train popular militias throughout the country to fight back. And many of these militias now have created their own, you know, fiefdoms of influence. This is not to say that nothing that happens in the country is ordered by the government. Certainly, especially at Damascus, a lot is. But it’s not outside the realm of possibility at all that local commanders could order attacks or engage in atrocities, which were never greenlighted by the government itself. They are the consequence of a state, which has been forcibly decentralized by so many years of stress and conflict.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. Murtaza Hussain, thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Murtaza Hussain is a reporter at The Intercept. Coming up on the show, we’re gonna hear from a Canadian citizen who’s originally from Syria. He was kidnapped by U.S. operatives at JFK Airport in 2002, and he was sent to Syria, where he was tortured by Assad’s intelligence service. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, most of the voices that we hear in U.S. news coverage of Syria are not Syrians. They are retired generals, political strategists, so-called terrorism experts, politicians, media personalities. There are great reporters that are covering this from the ground, including for corporate media networks. But it is — you know, when we’re talking about the generals, and the politicians, and Trump, and the Democrats, it’s easy to advocate for a war when you have no personal stakes in it, or when it makes you look tough as a politician; or, military strikes can be really convenient if you want to distract from scandals or controversies. Back in 2002, when George W. Bush was selling the case for the war in Iraq to the American people, he singled out Syria as a particularly evil country. And that’s a key part of why my next guest’s personal story is so horrifying.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Maher Arar is an engineer who was born in Syria. He immigrated to Canada when he was 17 years old in the 1980s. Maher built up his family in Canada. He got married. He has two kids. Back in September of 2002, Maher Arar and his wife and their two young children were on vacation outside of the United States, outside of Canada. Maher had to return early to Canada for work, so he left his wife and his kids back on vacation, and he had to connect in New York to then move on to Canada. He had his connecting flight at JFK Airport. And then came the hell.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Maher Arar was detained at JFK Airport. He was held for nearly two weeks on a suspicion that he had some connection to al Qaeda. After that period where he was held in New York, he was put onto a small aircraft by U.S. operatives. He was flown to the Middle Eastern nation of Jordan. And then the Jordanians took custody of him. They beat him. They drove him to Syria, and they handed him over to Bashar al-Assad’s Secret Police. Assad’s Secret Police and intelligence officials tortured and interrogated Maher Arar, and then eventually locked him in a dungeon for almost a year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Canadian government, after Maher Arar was freed, cleared him of any connection to terrorism. They apologized to him, and they gave him a settlement. The U.S. government has never acknowledged that Maher Arar was innocent, and that his kidnapping by U.S. operatives was totally unjustified. Maher Arar is still unable to enter the United States, and he believes that he remains on the No Fly list. So Maher Arar can’t join us in New York, but he does right now from Ottawa, Canada. Maher, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Maher Arar:\u003c/strong> Thank you, Jeremy, for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your reaction to the missile strikes ordered by Donald Trump and the geopolitical game that is now being played with Syria?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> I will never cheer the U.S. government striking other countries in any way, shape, or form because history has shown that when U.S. government intervenes, it’s never because of humanitarian reasons. But at the same time, we have to realize that a lot of people are dying in Syria, and Assad has committed horrible crimes. So, I won’t cheer on what the U.S. has done because I know especially Donald Trump has his own reasons for doing so, maybe political reasons. We all know that his ratings have been declining since he took over. So, yeah, I’m against interventions in general, but I also worry about the death toll in Syria that’s been mounting for years now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you think the United States should be doing in Syria right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> I don’t think the United States should have ever intervened in Syria at all, or in any other place. I think the international community should be involved as a world community, as opposed to just a single country. What worries me is the United States reasons behind intervening is not really to serve the Syrian people. And the other reason I am not of the opinion that the United States should be the only country taking action in Syria is because imperial past and even present, unfortunately, no other single country, you know, with no imperial past has taken the initiative to stand up and protect the Syrian people. That is reality on the ground.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Are you saying that you don’t believe that the United States should in any way seek to overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad by force or proxy forces?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> I don’t think the United States is serious in getting rid of Assad. I mean history proves that if anything, up until last week, the United States’ efforts has been directed at those who oppose Assad, whether it’s ISIS, or al Qaeda, or other groups. In my opinion, what happened last week, it’s just a face-saving exercise, nothing more, nothing less.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We’ve seen this sort of celebration of the cruise missile strike on corporate media in the United States. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are on the same team.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hillary Clinton:\u003c/strong> And I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But on the other side, we’ve seen a kind of interesting response from left-wing circles in the United States and elsewhere. And part of it seems to be that people are adopting an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” posture on Syria, where it’s not just about opposing U.S. intervention, or U.S. militarism, or U.S. regime change politics, but actually defending Bashar al-Assad. And I’m curious, ‘cause I know you’re very active on social media, what’s your analysis of both the way it’s been handled in the U.S. corporate media, but also in segments of the left in the United States and elsewhere?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> It’s only news when the United States intervenes, right? We all know that the United States has been intervening militarily at least since 2014. What also strikes me is the position that has been adopted by people who consider themselves to be on the left spectrum of politics. There is a good majority that have been portraying Assad as the victim. And I really don’t understand this position because you could still oppose U.S. intervention without siding with Assad and apologizing with his crimes. What I’ve noticed over the last year or so is that the position adopted by many pundits on the left and journalists — a few of them, at least — is that it really is going beyond analyzing the situation. It’s going beyond seeking the truth, and it’s going to basically attack Assad opponents and use the same language that Assad has been using to describe his opponents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The thing is, we always have to look at how people who are suffering in Syria, how they look at the situation, not how we look at it, right? I don’t deny that Assad has his own support in Syria. But the stats are very, very clear on this. Assad is behind the majority of destruction and death and misery in Syria. And it is not new. Assad does not really distinguish between those who carry arms and those who oppose him politically. There is absolutely no distinction. The starting ground should be to declare that Assad is a dictator, that Assad is not really friends of the West or friends of secularism. But he is really only a friend of his own self.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s interesting that you bring up Assad labeling his opponents as terrorists, because when the so-called War on Terror was launched by Bush and Cheney with the support of Democrats and Republicans alike, that was the language used by the most powerful people in the world, that you’re with us or you’re with the terrorist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President George W. Bush:\u003c/strong> Either you’re with us, either you love freedom and with nations, which embrace freedom, or you’re with the enemy. There’s no in between.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Maher, I want — for people who don’t know your backstory or why you have credibility beyond the fact that you’re — you were born in Syria and your roots are in Syria, what happened to you, in summary, after 9/11?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> Well, I was arrested at JFK Airport, and I did not know that the Canadian police had sent some information about me to the U.S. government. I was detained. I was not given food for at least 24 hours. I was, you know, not told what charges were laid against me. I was told to go to Syria willingly, and when I refused, in the middle of the night about, I think, 12 days later, I was shipped off to Jordan — to Syria via Jordan on a private jet. There, I spent in Syria about a year. I was physically abused and tortured at the very beginning. During that time, I was detained in underground cell that I still call, until this day, the coffin or the grave. I thought I was gonna die, frankly, and in fact, I wished death many times because that awful place was a psychological torture on its own. And I was released mainly because my wife lobbied on my behalf.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Reynolds:\u003c/strong> A CIA plane shipped him first to Jordan. Then he was driven to Syria. Yesterday, Canadian judge Dennis O’Connor, who had investigated Arar’s case for almost two years, said that Arar had no links to terrorists.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Judge Dennis O’Connor:\u003c/strong> I’m able to say categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arar has committed any offense, or that his activities constitute a threat to the security of Canada.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Robert Siegel: \u003c/strong>So far, the Bush administration has tried to prevent the case from being heard on the grounds that it would harm national security.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dina Temple-Raston:\u003c/strong> Maher Arar couldn’t attend the hearing. That’s because he’s on a No Fly list and can’t come to the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> And there was an inquiry in Canada eventually that basically cleared my name, blamed both the U.S. government and the Canadian government for my fate. And eventually also, I settled a lawsuit against the Canadian government. The U.S. government never, never, never acknowledged their role in my — in what happened to me, and they dismissed my lawsuit. And we tried to bring our lawsuit to the Supreme Court, but unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused. And most of the arguments that were raised were based on state secrets argument.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the things that just strikes me is your incredible humility. I say that because I think a lot of people, if they were in your situation, where they were rendered by the United States, you believe quite likely the CIA, to Syria, where you then were brutalized and held in this underground small tomb, that they would be taking the position that the Assad regime should be overthrown by any means necessary. And I’m just wondering how it is that you have come to a position that is far more nuanced than that, and that you’re not just motivated by bitterness or anger at the injustice. Set aside the other policies of Assad in Syria, but just based on what happened to you, how is it that you are able to look at this in the way that you do, versus just, he should be overthrown?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> I’ve always been able to survive by trying to understand the other. Like, one way I was able to cope with what happened to me is by trying to put myself in the shoes who sent me to Syria. I’m not trying to justify their action, but I’m just trying to understand why they took that decision, just to come to terms with what happened to me. You know, there was 9/11, they were scared, they did not think rationally. It’s always good to have empathy for the others, even if they have done evil to you. So I do agree, you know, that the U.S. government has done injustice to me — big injustice, in fact. But at the same time, I can’t let this blind me from seeing the good side of things, right? I can’t let what happened to me and my personal experience blind me from the facts. So if the U.S., for example, has been wrong on my — like with respect to my story, they might be — you know, they might be right on other things. So, I can’t just paint everyone and every action with the same color. I have to — otherwise, I would just not be just, right? That’s why, when I look at the U.S. actions in the Middle East, I have to distinguish between what’s good and what’s bad. And based on that, I make a judgment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is there any doubt in your mind that Assad did in fact use chemical weapons on the occasions that it’s been reported, most recently April 4\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> in Idlib?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> There’s no doubt. There’s no doubt. Whether Assad knew about it or not, that’s not for me to answer. But there is no doubt that Assad has used it two weeks ago, and he even used it before. There is no doubt about that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How do you think this could be resolved or ended in the best way possible for Syrians? Not for global powers, but for Syrians?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> Well, Jeremy, I wish I had the crystal ball. By no means, I’m saying that the United States should intervene and put a stop to this. But if the international community, maybe through the U.N., does not take serious action and say, “Enough is enough,” I think he will continue with his slaughter. And in fact, he has been playing a very, very smart game so far, smarter than anyone else, including Trump, by emphasizing that the people who is — who he is fighting are all terrorists. And unfortunately, this message has so far resonated with European countries. And that explains why there is reluctance to try to get rid of Assad. I would be very much happy if Assad today say, “You know what? Let us stop the war.” And I think he owns that decision, by the way. And I believe has owned it for a long time. “Let us stop all this, you know, war. Let us sit together. Let us find a political solution.” And he has to stop portraying all of his opponents as terrorists. And this is the only way to go forward. And if Assad is willing to leave power by elections, I think this would be the best solution. But if he continues to label all his opponents as terrorists, I just really don’t see how this will end. It’s unfortunate, but this is the reality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and of course, Assad is doing that, just as other despots and thugs around the world do, and just as the United States has done on numerous occasions. But there really are terrorists in Syria. There is such a thing as the Islamic state. There are foreign fighters who have poured in. They do control parts of Syria. And I’m wondering if you just completely reject the notion that the alternative to Assad is that these groups consolidate more power in larger swaths of territory inside of Syria?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> I think the role of ISIS and, you know, similar like-minded groups have been magnified in the West. This is because ISIS and such groups, part of their agenda is to go outside Syrian borders, right? So, the West view them as a threat, as opposed to Assad, the secular. This is the reality. I mean, if you look at the stats and who is responsible for the most destruction in Syria, I mean, by far, Assad is the big winner. So I think the role of ISIS and al Qaeda have been taken out of proportion, and talk about ISIS and very little about Assad. And of course, the average citizen will think ISIS is the biggest threat to the world. It may be from the Western point of view, but for Syrians, ISIS and like-minded groups, they’re not the biggest threat to their existence. And that’s the reality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Maher Arar, I always — every time I talk to you or I’m with you, I’m in awe of the humanity that you exhibit given everything that’s happened to you and to your family. And I just — I want to thank you for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MA:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me, Jeremy. Good luck.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Maher Arar is a Syrian-born Canadian engineer. He was kidnapped by U.S. intelligence at JFK Airport in September of 2002, and he was taken in an extraordinary rendition to be tortured in Bashar al-Assad’s Syria. Maher Arar is now the CEO of CauseSquare, a fundraising application for social justice causes and other campaigns.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That does it for the show.

This week on Intercepted: We spend the entire show talking with Assange from inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has been holed up since June 2012. In the wide-ranging interview, Assange discusses the allegations that WikiLeaks was abetted by Russian intelligence in its publication of DNC emails and the new-found admiration for him by FOX News, Anne Coulter, Sarah Palin, and Donald Trump. Also, why Assange believes he and Hillary Clinton may get along if they ever met in person.

And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded. What do you do? And we made a determination to do it. So, the missiles were on the way, heading to Iraq.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Maria Bartiromo:\u003c/strong> Well, headed to Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Yes. Heading toward Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let all doubts be laid to permanent rest. Donald Trump has become the commander-in-chief. Donald Trump is now presidential. And he is keeping us all safe from Iraq — or Syria, whatever country that is. He also deployed Vice President Mike Pence to the demilitarized zone on the border between North Korea and South Korea. And while he was there, Mike Pence wore his leather bomber jacket. And he made clear that his boss, the commander-in-chief, was putting nuclear-armed North Korea on notice. Kim Jong-un should look no further than Trump’s cruise missile strike on the Syrian airfield, and the dropping of the MOAB, the mother of all bombs, in Nangarhar province in Afghanistan. And by the way, it was already named the mother of all bombs before we learned the Mike Pence calls his wife “mother.” It was just a coincidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, last week, the White House announced that it had sent an aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, and four other battleships into the Sea of Japan. And this was talked about in the press by White House officials as this warning to the North Koreans. It was Trump once again being presidential. And it was a warning to North Korea, and it was a bold statement on the full range of military options – and this is how it was portrayed in the press — the full range of military options that Trump has on the table. And when I think about Trump having military options on the table, I think of some random table on the al fresco patio that Trump is sitting at in Mar-a-Lago, taking selfies and crashing peoples’ weddings. But on Tuesday of this week, we learned that, oops, those ships that Trump was so presidential in deploying to stand down against Kim Jong-un and nuclear North Korea — yeah, they were actually heading in the opposite direction from North Korea. That’s presidential.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But don’t worry. We have the very noble people at the CIA and within the U.S. military, the quiet professionals in the intelligence community that are protecting us from the dangers of Donald Trump, right? That’s the narrative that we’re told, particularly by liberal pundits, that there is this secret clique of people within the intelligence community, the CIA and others, that are really gonna protect us from the true dangers of Donald Trump. Well, last Thursday, CIA Director Mike Pompeo delivered his first major public address. And of all of the threats in the world that he chose to focus on, he chose WikiLeaks, and the founder of WikiLeaks: Julian Assange.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CIA Director Mike Pompeo:\u003c/strong> WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service, and has encouraged its followers to find jobs at the CIA in order to obtain intelligence. It’s time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service, often abetted by state actors like Russia. We have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us, to give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets as a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I think it would be a mistake to view Pompeo’s speech as just an attack on WikiLeaks. In fact, it was nothing short of a declaration of war against the First Amendment. And what does that mean, “ends now”? Of course, part of the irony here is that Donald Trump, throughout the campaign, heaped praise on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> This just came out. This just came out. WikiLeaks — I love WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Fox News promoted WikiLeaks releases of the DNC emails and John Podesta’s emails. Republicans and extreme rightwing political figures, pundits, whatever you want to call people like Ann Coulter, these people that had previously called basically for Assange’s head were suddenly taking it all back. Oh, WikiLeaks is great. For the Democrats, of course, the focus on WikiLeaks has been they published volumes of emails from within the DNC and from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta. And the story goes in the liberal media that it was all a plot orchestrated by the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin to get Trump elected. That’s why Hillary Clinton lost. Russian hacking, Julian Assange — everything else is just an insignificant sideshow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hillary Clinton:\u003c/strong> Putin and the Russian government are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts, to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information. We don’t even know if it’s accurate information. And then they put it out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, what does it mean that the CIA Director has said that basically, WikiLeaks “ends now?” By what means would the CIA accomplish that? Julian Assange is holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and he’s been there since June of 2012. And Assange believes that if he were to leave the embassy, that there is a great chance that he would be snatched and ultimately extradited to the United States, where for years, Assange and his legal team have believed that there was a sealed indictment against him for the activities of WikiLeaks for the past decade, exposing U.S. war operations, and publishing state department cables and videos that show U.S. helicopter gunships killing civilians and journalists in Iraq.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Audio from WikiLeaks’ released “Collateral Murder” video\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker 1:\u003c/strong> Just fuckin’ — once you get on, just open up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker 2:\u003c/strong> I am.

[Gunshots]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, they’re talked about pretty much every day in the U.S. media now. They’re the focus of parts of Congressional testimony and inquiries, and also conspiracy theories about who really is Julian Assange working for? Well, at Intercepted, we believe that it’s important to hear from the man himself in his own words. And so, Julian Assange joins us now from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Julian, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Julian Assange:\u003c/strong> Good day, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is your response to the dominant narrative in the U.S. corporate media that you were the recipient of leaks that were either overtly or covertly provided to you by the Russians in an effort to defeat Hillary Clinton and ensure that Donald Trump was elected?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s interesting. If you read the wording carefully, that’s not the dominant narrative. That’s never said in anything that’s fact-checked because James Clapper, the former head of the DNI, James Comey have both said under oath, and Barack Obama, in the last — his very last press conference, actually, that WikiLeaks is no different to the rest of the U.S. media. There’s no allegation, even from U.S. intelligence, even from Democratic-aligned members of the intelligence services, that WikiLeaks dealt with the Russians, conspired with the Russians, etc., etc. The allegation is, from them, which we don’t accept, is that we received material that was given to us indirectly, and that they don’t have an understanding of how we got our material, the timing, etc. That’s said in Congress under oath. So, if we compare WikiLeaks with the rest of the U.S. media, who else published material allegedly leaked or hacked from the Democratic Party? The Hill did, The Smoking Gun did, New York Times, Politico, drawing on both our publications and alleged publications from Guccifer 2.0 or this alleged website, D.C. Leaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But in the case of Guccifer 2.0, the allegation by U.S. intelligence is that he was a member of the Russian intelligence services, so GRU. And the same with D.C. Leaks. And various media organizations dealt directly with D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0. But the allegation in relation to us is that — which, once again, we don’t agree with — but that Russian hackers of some kind gave information to various state parties or approved of by the state, and eventually, it came to us. So, there’s an acceptance by the officials in the U.S. Obama administration that WikiLeaks was not engaging directly with the Russian government at all, but other U.S. media organizations were directly engaging with the Russian government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Just to clarify here, when I talk about the dominant narrative in the news media, I’m not referring to the Clapper statements or Obama statements that you accurately portray there. I’m talking about the kind of commentariat that exists on —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yes, that’s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On U.S. media. That’s too nuanced for them. They don’t —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> And you look at what Pompeo, the current director of the CIA, stated. He said that WikiLeaks is a publisher, or I can’t remember exactly what word he used, that was abetted by other state intelligence agencies, including Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MP:\u003c/strong> In January of this year, our intelligence committee determined that Russian military intelligence, the GRU, had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> So, what is he saying — what does he mean by “abetted”? We don’t know. The word isn’t unpacked. But if it is to be compatible with what James Comey said just a couple of weeks ago, what Obama said in January, and what DNI Clapper said last year, he must be speaking about indirectly, somehow, information came to WikiLeaks and we published it. That’s what he means by “abetted”.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, actually, Julian, he said — and this is a direct quote — “It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it is, a non-state hostile intelligence service, often abetted by state actors like Russia.” He’s not referring to you as a publisher. He’s referring to you as — you meaning WikiLeaks — as a non-state hostile intelligence service.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, I quite like the phrase. So, let’s unpack it a bit. Interestingly, what the media, in picking up that statement — well, most journalists in the United States are Democratically-aligned, and they have a particular existing narrative that they want to play out. So, they see the word “state,” they see the word “hostile,” they see the word “intelligence service,” and they see the word “WikiLeaks,” and somehow, they put this soup together to imply that somehow, WikiLeaks is a state intelligence service. But if you look at what he’s saying, he says non-state intelligence service; i.e., we are not a state. We’re not a front for a state whatsoever. We’re a non-state entity. Okay, the type of entity that he’s trying to say we are is an intelligence service. It raises an interesting question. What are the similarities between publishers, investigative publishers, and intelligence services? Are there similarities?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yes, there are similarities. For example, the German intelligence service, the BND, the German equivalent of the CIA and NSA combined — what does BND expand to? Bundesnachrichtendienst, which literally means “federal news service.” The CIA itself, early on in the Obama administration, changed its policy of how it would write its internal reports to say that they should take on the inverted pyramid style. They should adopt the style used by news articles internally in making their reports. So, can you say that The Intercept or WikiLeaks or ProPublica is in fact like an intelligence service? Well, yes and no. Intelligence services are in the business of developing sources, obtaining information that is not already public, analyzing it, verifying it, writing some of that up, making it accessible. And then, what do they do with it? They don’t publish it. The publishers, what do they do with the information? They publish it. So, the different between a serious news organization that covers national security or an investigative publisher like WikiLeaks, or The Intercept, or ProPublica, or the London Bureau of Investigative Journalism is that their end product is publishing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. You know, of course, we all watched with some curiosity as Pompeo used a line from an Intercept article to attack you. And I wanted to give you a chance —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yes. I never liked that article. I — [laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But I want to give you a chance to — this, of course, was an article by Sam Biddle. And I wanted to give you a chance to respond to that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I can’t remember the name at the time, but I do remember reading the article at the time and thinking, that was inaccurate and unhelpful in the present climate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, what he said is —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MP\u003c/strong>: The Intercept, which has in the past gleefully reported unauthorized disclosures, accused WikiLeaks in late March of “stretching the facts” in its comments about the CIA. In the same article, The Intercept added that the documents “were not worth the concern WikiLeaks generated by its public comments.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This was referring to the Vault 7 releases that you published.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I think that was about Signal. We had this incredible scoop that we’re in the business of publishing right now, which is in fact the reason why Pompeo is launching this attack, is because he understands we’re in this series exposing all sorts of illegal actions by the CIA, so he’s trying to get ahead of the publicity curve and create a preemptive defense. So, one of the, I thought, important revelations from our initial Vault 7 publication was that the CIA had spent enormous resources on developing endpoint attacks. That is, to attack your smartphone directly, Apple or Android smartphones, and thereby simply bypass Signal and all these other encryption technologies: Telegram, WhatsApp, etc., that have become popular in the last few years. There’s been a kind of app cult which has developed amongst a certain journalistic and security class, which emanates out of San Francisco, where Signal was — might still be developed. And that app supremacy class sort of pushes forward that you just install this app, and all your problems will be solved.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We thought it was very important to show that, no, that’s not true. The encryption itself is quite good in most of those programs, as far as can be determined, but if you can hack the endpoints, the encryption doesn’t matter. They’re still important for preventing or making the expanse of bulk surveillance harder. But if you are a person of interest and they get your phone number, they can hack your endpoint.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And the fact is that two years ago, a report I did described how the NSA and GCHQ had in fact broken into, both physically and digitally, broken into the largest manufacturer of SIM cards in the world —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Gemalto, which is a Dutch-French firm. And part of the point of that was, if we have the keys to every lock on every phone, it doesn’t matter what their encryption level is because we can access the data. And I think that the same is true, of course, with Signal, WhatsApp, or any other — or your computer. If they owned your computer, no level of encryption is gonna protect you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> That’s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>If they already have you keylogged. So, on that level, to —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah. If they have the information before it’s encrypted and they get it after it’s decrypted on the other end.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. But you have to admit that the way that it was reported — I’m not saying you projected it this way. The way it was reported was, oh my god, there are these flaws in Signal. And in a bigger picture, you can say, yes, there are. This is an inherent flaw of every app. But are you concerned? I mean, don’t you —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> It’s not a flaw in Signal. It’s not a flaw in Signal. It is a flaw in the marketing of Signal and the marketing of these apps. This kind of — as I said, this cultish app supremacy that doesn’t want to talk about, yes, these are important. They make it much harder to conduct mass surveillance. But on the other hand, if you’re a person of interest, there’s plenty of ways to actually get in behind the encryption by hacking your phone. If the marketing had been done accurately, it wouldn’t have been a news story. It would have already been known. Because amongst technical people, of course, this already was known, of course, if they hack your phone, these encryption tools are worthless. But it was news. And it was news because of the misleading information that had been put about those crypto-products.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I agree with the warning that you’re sounding, which is that if people adopt the view, “oh my god, if I put Signal on my phone and that’s the only way that I communicate with people on sensitive issues, then I’m totally safe,” that that’s rank bullshit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, that’s pretty dangerous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. No, I agree with you. I agree, it’s dangerous. So, let me ask you a couple of quick-fire questions about the way WikiLeaks has been portrayed in the U.S. media, just to get this, in a more precise way, answered. Was WikiLeaks in possession of any RNC emails that it did not publish?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> No. Very interestingly, Comey, in his last Congressional testimony, he was asked a question. I can’t remember exactly the context, but his answer was, “No RNC leaks were published.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Jim Himes:\u003c/strong> Let me just ask this question, then. Was there any equivalent dissemination of adverse information stolen from the RNC or individuals associated with the Trump campaign?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>James Comey:\u003c/strong> No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JH:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> And that’s false. I find it quite strange that — we didn’t publish any ‘cause we didn’t have any, but I find it quite strange that James Comey, under oath, would say something that is provably untrue and is an obviously relevant matter which he should know about. I mean, this D.C. Leaks outfit did publish a range of RNC emails. They weren’t picked up because — I think because it’s a kind of stupid website with — it’s very hard to read, had no credibility, didn’t promote the material well. But that was published during August 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Would you have published in the same manner RNC emails in the race between Hillary and Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Of course. When does WikiLeaks get a great scoop and not publish it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, no, I know. I’m asking because I’m responding to some of the idiocy in the U.S. press.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it’s — to some degree, WikiLeaks is — we’re a hostage to fortune because we do specialize on encouraging whistleblowers and other sources to step forward, and then analyzing what we get from them. And we specialize on really big scoops. You can’t go, oh, look, we have this massive scoop about corruption in the DNC. Now we need to balance this with a massive scoop about corruption in the RNC. These things come along once every few years. I mean, you can’t, you can’t go, “oh, now we’re going to balance.” Like, put it another way — did any other media organization publish a massive leak about what was in the RNC? The combined forces of the U.S. media, which, apart from Fox, was pretty solidly in the Hillary camp, and the European media, which was much the same, were not able to find any massive scoop on Donald Trump, apart from the sex tape. The New York Times got hold of one small tax extract for one year, which is not a massive scoop —and none of the other — none of the other years and none of the other papers. We asked for those. You know, we encouraged people to step forward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think part of what is going on is it’s kind of flattering that there’s a view that WikiLeaks is omnipotent in its ability to get hold of massive scoops whenever it wants. That’s nice. It’s good for the institution’s reputation. But it’s not true. Massive scoops are hard to come by. They’re hard to come by, and they come at their own time, not when you think, oh, we need to — we need to, you know, engage in a bit of balancing operation, so, you know, people stop falsely saying that we’re Republican-aligned.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. Well, and I should say that both Glenn Greenwald and myself were attacked in a similar vein to you, where they were saying, oh, you guys were harping on Hillary Clinton. You were talking about her emails, and you were part of how Trump got elected. I mean, you of course got this on a totally different level than we did. But we got —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Oh, I noticed that you guys were getting that as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And then — and what we were doing was reporting on what you were publishing at WikiLeaks. But I want to ask you, did you have, during the campaign, communications with Roger Stone or other members of the Trump campaign about messaging, or what you were publishing, or what was going to come up? Did Roger Stone ever get a scoop from you where you told him, “we’re gonna be doing this thing?” ‘Cause he seemed to indicate that he was getting information from you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Roger Stone:\u003c/strong> I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next crunch of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation. But there’s no telling what the October surprise may be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> People are just being led through their noses by Roger Stone. If there was some conspiracy with Roger Stone, do you think he would be trying to intimate that he had some undefined, unnamed back channel? He’s just trying — well, I’m not going to project what I think is happening inside his head, particularly since he’s said nice things about us. But the result of what his statements were is that suddenly, people in the Republican base, which he was talking to, started paying him attention. He started getting spots on TV. He started getting a lot of attention, and started selling a lot more books. So, I mean, it’s an amazing bit of chutzpah and pretty clever marketing, but there was no communication.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, you never —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> We have had a communication with Roger Stone. I admit it. Do you want me to tell you what it is?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> It was, “Why are you saying — why are you going around saying we have communicated? We have no record of communication with you. We’re not aware of any form of communication. What are you saying?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that was it. That’s the extent of you and, to your knowledge, WikiLeaks’s communications with Roger Stone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> During the campaign, yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And since, has he?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> After the campaign, it’s a similar type of, “what are you doing?” Stone complaining, “Stop attacking me. I’m a supporter, so, why are you attacking me?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you know how you got the DNC emails?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> That treads on sourcing, so —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, I know. I’m trying to ask in a way, Julian, that respects —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I’ll put the response in another way. For each publication, we develop an understanding of the publication and its context, to the point where we are confident in its veracity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. I respect that, but I think you, being a publisher and being in this game for a long time, understand why people would want to understand your perspective on this question. Are you confident —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I agree. I agree. I, I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, are you confident that you did not get these from Russia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I apologize that WikiLeaks can’t name its sources.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, I don’t want you to name your source, Julian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> We wouldn’t have any if we went around naming them, or talking about, or kind of giving a 20 clues perspective.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Come on, Julian. You know I’m not asking you to do that. I’m saying, are you confident, as a publisher of a very influential organization — are you confident that you were not given these documents by a foreign government for their own purposes?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I’m confident in what we have already stated, that our source is not part of a government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. But let’s game this out. Let’s say someone, let’s say —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> No, I’m not talking about — I’m not gonna go into who — where our sources placed our — who our source’s, you know, friends are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, let me put it on myself. Let’s say. —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> — Anything like that. I’m not going near it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But let me put it on myself. Let’s say that I get a cache of documents from a source, and I’m trying to determine where those documents came from. And I suspect that they may have come from a foreign intelligence service. Now, to me, that doesn’t mean, “oh my god, you don’t publish them because they came from a foreign intelligence service.” It means you have to figure out, are these accurate? What is the context of what they say? Do they give a complete picture? And what is the potential — what are the potential voids in the information? Do you feel like you did enough diligence to —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> In terms of voids and accuracy, yes. Very confident.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>J\u003cstrong>S:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. And on a philosophical level, Julian, ‘cause I know you actually have a firm grasp of philosophy — on a philosophical level, if the documents were received from a foreign government, and you had verified the accuracy of them, the context of them, and that there wasn’t some big missing piece, do you believe that those still should be published?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, not only do I believe that they should still be published. That’s the recently stated position of Dean Baquet, the editor of the New York Times. It’s not a — I don’t think there’s much argument.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dean Baquet:\u003c/strong> But I think that truth trumps strategy and everything else every day. And if a powerful figure writes emails that are newsworthy, you just gotta publish ‘em. I mean, look, Edward Snowden stole documents. We, the Guardian, the Washington Post, and others reported them. I think they provoked one of the most compelling arguments about national security we’ve had in a generation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Let’s kind of flip the situation. Just imagination if WikiLeaks had obtained information they knew was true about the Democratic Party and corruption in the primary process, and it decided that it was not going to publish that information, but suppress it. It would be completely unconscionable. It was something you go, like, could we actually do it? Could we suppress information? WikiLeaks can’t keep coherency amongst its staff, it can’t have a committed, dedicated staff, which you need to survive in this kind of serious conflict with intelligence agencies. It couldn’t have that esprit de corps if we went around suppressing information that we knew to be true that lots of people were interested in, in order to favor one particular candidate in an election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In a few minutes, we’re gonna continue our conversation with Julian Assange. And I want to ask him about Fox News’ newly found admiration for him and for WikiLeaks. And also, before we go to break, we wanted to share with you a song sent in to us by the legendary musician Tom Morello. He, of course, is one of the most celebrated guitarists of our time. He was a founder, original member of Rage Against the Machine and Street Sweeper Social Club. Tom, more recently, has been performing as The Nightwatchman, and he is now part of the — I guess you could say supergroup of the ‘90s. It’s called Prophets of Rage, and it’s Tom Morello, and Chuck D of Public Enemy, and B-Real from Cypress Hill. Well, Tom sent us a song, and the song has never been publicly released before now.

We’re gonna take a quick break and then return with more questions for Julian Assange of WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back now on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MP:\u003c/strong> No, Julian Assange and his kind are not the slightest bit interested in improving civil liberties or enhancing personal freedom. They have pretended America’s First Amendment freedoms shield them from justice. They may have believed that, but they’re wrong. Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value. He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous. He is a fraud, a coward hiding behind a screen. And in Kansas, we know something about wizards hiding behind screens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was CIA Director Mike Pompeo, again, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency. And our guest remains the man Pompeo put in the crosshairs of the CIA, Julian Assange of WikiLeaks. Julian, the CIA Director spent the majority of his speech on you and on WikiLeaks. And I’m curious, as you watched this speech from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, what was your immediate reaction?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, initially, we thought it was quite a weak speech in that it put the CIA in a position where they looked like they were frightened and worried that we were the better intelligence service, ‘cause they decided to put us in that competitive context. I think the Director of the CIA should have gravitas, so that you feel that he’s a sober person, a very considered person, who is able to look closely at the information that he and his teams are assembling, and ensure that it’s accurate and not politicized. And as his first speech, Pompeo was not demonstrating that to CIA staff or to the intelligence partners of the CIA, or to the media, or anyone else who has to go, well, is what the CIA is saying about Syria — is that true or not? Can I be confident that Pompeo is a measured man with gravitas, insight, who wouldn’t lie to me? And when he descended into pompous kind of name-calling, that’s not what intelligence reporting should be about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MP:\u003c/strong> First, to the days like today, where we call up those who grant a platform to these leakers and so-called transparency activists. We know the danger that Assange and his not-so-merry band of brothers pose to democracies around the world. Ignorance or misplaced idealism is no longer an acceptable excuse for lionizing these demons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Look, Pompeo said explicitly that he was going to redefine the legal parameters of the First Amendment to define publishers like WikiLeaks in such a manner that the First Amendment would not apply to them. What the hell is going on? This is the head of the largest intelligence service in the world, the intelligence service of the United States. He doesn’t get to make proclamations on interpretation of the law. That’s a responsibility for the courts. It’s a responsibility for Congress. And perhaps it’s a responsibility for the attorney general. It’s way out of line to usurp the roles of those entities that are formally engaged in defining the interpretations of the First Amendment. For any — frankly, any other group to pronounce themselves, but for the head of the CIA, to pronounce what the boundaries are of reporting and not reporting are is a very disturbing precedent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And of course, Donald Trump has referred to himself as a media organization because of his social media following. So, I’d be curious to know what Director Pompeo thinks about that. But I wanted to ask you —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, the First — he was saying, “Julian Assange has no First Amendment rights.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> This is not how the First Amendment works. It’s just legally wrong. The First Amendment is not a positive definition of rights. It’s a negative definition. It limits what the federal government does. It doesn’t say the federal government must give individuals rights and enforce that. It limits what the federal government can do to take away a certain climate of open debate in the United States. So, the First Amendment prevents Congress and the Executive from engaging in actions themselves which would limit not only the ability of people to speak and to publish freely, but would also limit the ability of people to read and understand information, because it is that climate of public debate which creates a check on a centralized governmental structure from becoming authoritarian. It’s a right from that perspective for all the people, not just the publisher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was it like for you when Donald Trump would mention you publicly or mention WikiLeaks publicly, or tweet — even though he somehow never could seem to spell WikiLeaks correctly, but he did tweet about WikiLeaks frequently?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> He did correct it once. He did make a correction once.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, good. Okay, well, at least he corrected that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> By the way, did you see another one? Another one came in today. This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, just on a personal level, Julian, like, what was it like to see Trump citing WikiLeaks during the course of his campaign in the way that he did?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, whenever a high-profile person cites our material, especially when a big audience is watching, we think, great, more people are gonna read it. From that perspective, we thought, well, this is great. Donald Trump is marketing our material. People are gonna read it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but he got you some really reprehensible fans. I mean, come on, Sean Hannity comes over and sits down. I mean, Sean Hannity is an amoral charlatan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but I don’t — I’m not a groupist, if that makes sense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, I know you’re not, but come — give me a break. I mean, Sean Hannity is — he’s a carnival barker for extreme rightwing causes in the United States, and he jumped onto the WikiLeaks bandwagon for his own partisan, narrow political purposes. He’s no friend of WikiLeaks or free information.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, and probably Sarah Palin did as well. But did Sarah Palin say the right thing? Did she do the right thing? Why, Sarah Palin said I should be hunted down like the Taliban. We published her emails in 2008, and she subsequently came out and apologized, and said that people should watch the Snowden film. So, this is very interesting. This is not just about WikiLeaks. This is about a, my guess, a certain perception amongst populist rightwing politicians like Sarah Palin, that the population has shifted in what it expects, and that critiques of mass surveillance and WikiLeaks are now something that are becoming something that’s sayable. And of course, yes, on a particular — on the narrow basis, something that we publish which damages the reputation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the head of the DNC, or something like that — of course, that’s just party political. But I wouldn’t underestimate that there is an important transition in this populist right sphere. And you can talk about how it’s been instrumentalized and so on. But there’s a — I think a very important transition where a number of the grassroots on the populist right are saying wars or intervention are bad. The CIA is problematic. That’s an extraordinary education that has occurred in that light.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, but I think —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> And I don’t think — I don’t think it comes about just because of Donald Trump. But the election campaign certainly brought it out to a greater degree, and Trump and his team tried to harmonize with parts of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But Julian, look at it from the other side, which I’ve experienced in my time as a reporter. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are in power. Liberals love me. Oh, I’m writing about Blackwater. Oh, I’m writing about Iraq, etc. Then Obama comes into power and shoots the popularity ratings of drone strikes off the charts. MSNBC, I’m basically persona non grata. And a lot of it was about their own partisan leanings. I mean I felt dirty as fuck the other day when Ann Coulter followed me on Twitter and is retweeting me positively.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, she said I should be prosecute — you know, she went on Bill O’Reilly in 2010 and said I should be prosecuted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, and now she probably wants to come visit you and bring you flowers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> And then — and then she said some good things. I just, I think you have to —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but – but Julian, come on. You and I have both been around –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> You have to —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wait, no. I want to stop you on this. I just want to ask you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> All the big mainstream media outfits are evil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but Julian, you seem to be —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA\u003c/strong>: The massive media holdings, they’re just serious power players. I mean, there’s — that I can discern, there’s no genuine human moral values that are being pushed by these guys. But you have to instrumentalize them, just like you’ve got to put Shell in your car.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> People who want to get the truth out, they have to instrumentalize these big networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There is an extent to which I get the logic there. I do think, though, and I’m not necessarily saying this is the conclusion I draw from what you’re saying. But I do think that — I’m not certain that you’ve brought Sean Hannity along to some realization that what the NSA has been doing represents a fundamental violation of our rights. I think that these guys are in the moment, saying, “Huh, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” And I do think — I mean, you certainly are a shrewd enough person to understand that these guys aren’t your friends. They aren’t in sync with your —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I think that’s largely right. But is it great that, you know, a network like Fox might actually pick up true material?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, it’s surreal, Julian. But it exists at a moment in time —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> [Crosstalk] sometimes, but for WikiLeaks to be able to present true material to a wide audience, that’s a good thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, I agree with you a hundred percent there, and I find it surreal and amazing, and I’ll — in a way, I’ll take it any way I can get it, and I give you total credit for somehow figuring out a way to get Sean Hannity to come to London, into the embassy that you’ve been basically imprisoned in for years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> It’s incredible. And, you know — and publicly apologize, etc. He has taken some heat for that, by the way. I wouldn’t — in my view, you know, I guess Trump is an interesting figure psychologically. But Sean Hannity’s more normal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yes, of course there’s groupism operating and probably opportunism as well. But, you know, I don’t think you can cast these people as devils at all. These are people with a range of noble and ignoble character traits. They’re human beings. And they have a worldview, and it really is a worldview. They exist within a particular information sphere, which I find fairly confining and self-referential, and believe some weird things. But I think that’s a product of the information that they receive, their upbringing, their — you know, the networks who are keeping them in a particular bubble. And I don’t think it’s because, with some exceptions, that they are intrinsically bad human beings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m not saying they’re intrinsically bad human beings. I do believe — first of all, the way that Trump referenced you on the campaign trail, he should have given you immunity and exonerated you of any potential future prosecution, given what he —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> I mean he should have done that anyway. We didn’t need to — because, I mean, Obama should have done that. It’s — those are the rules of the DOJ introduced in 2005. And, you know, if they follow those rules, if they follow the First Amendment, they shouldn’t be pursuing a prosecution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. But I mean, I agree with that logic. But what I was saying is if — I was more making a direct statement, which is that if Trump truly believes that what you’ve done is a public service, which Obama, you know, he flirted with a version of that about parts of what Snowden did. But what I’m saying is that if Trump asserted these things about the public value of what you did —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And promoted the idea that WikiLeaks was a pro-democracy organization, which he did, then it’s a much more obvious call on him to say, “Okay, well, then do the logical thing,” than Obama, who took a publicly hostile and privately hostile stance toward you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but you have — I mean who knows what would have happened anyway. But of course, the Russian narrative has politically confined the administration in relation to a whole lot — in relation to anything that’s anywhere near that narrative. That’s us. That’s having peace with Russia. And of course, it’s ultimately, in my view, the declining popularity, coming out of a variety of things, but including the eating away at Trump by the Russian narrative that has caused him to look for distractions. And those distractions include throwing missiles at people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I mean, and it’s — you know, he now is in the mode where I think he realizes how good it is to embrace the idea —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, he’s seen it. I mean, it’s —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. It’s — it makes him drunk with power. I mean, you’re —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> The cable networks across the board, including CNN, CBS, ABC, were in love with his missile strike on Syria, and he’s seen that and understood it. Early on, it seems to me that he was making a mistake with how he was setting up the cabinet. And I remarked on it at the time that it was becoming very general-heavy, and that that could lead to serious problems.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I see my generals. Those generals are gonna keep us so safe. They’re gonna have a lot of problems, the other side. They’re gonna look at — they’re gonna look at a couple of ‘em. These are central casting. If I’m doing a movie, I’d pick you, General.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> There was a reason it was becoming very general-heavy. Well, my interpretation is that the democratically aligned media’s constant assault on him, which also correlated with an assault on him by the Central Intelligence Agency, lessly agreed to FBI, resulted in him going, “Well, I have to have some people that they’re not going to criticize, and who are part of the core power element of the state.” You can’t have a presidency or a cabinet, which doesn’t have loyal hard power. So, what are the hard power elements? It’s the military, and the police, possibly the judiciary, insofar as they couple to the police. And so, he didn’t have the police. Definitely didn’t have the judiciary. There’s one more. It’s soft power, but it can translate to hard power, which is the general support of the population, because ultimately, serious support of the population will dominate the streets. So, he had to rely on building up support from the Pentagon. As a result, the cabinet became general-heavy, and now we see the result.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> A final question. Obviously, you have reason to identify former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as one of the people who put you in the position that you’re in and went after WikiLeaks with a passion. Was there any part of you during the publication of the DNC emails or the political campaign — was part of this a vendetta or part of the war between what was Hillary Clinton’s State Department and WikiLeaks? Was there —is there any truth to the idea that you wanted Hillary Clinton to fail to win the presidency?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, that’s kind of the psychobabble explanation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That’s why I’m asking you for it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m asking you because that’s what people say.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> If a man does something and it’s, you know, substantive, then it must be because he has a problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, it’s a question that I’m asking you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> That’s the type — that’s kind of East Coast psychobabble —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: No. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Explanation for why things occur.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, maybe that’s true, Julian. But I’m just, I’m asking you because this is — you’re in your own prison of sorts because you can’t leave that embassy. The American people are in the prison of their own cable news vacuum.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that is a big part of the narrative. So, I’m trying to give you an opportunity to respond to what people are basically told all the time about you on television here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, I’ve never met Hillary Clinton. I think I would probably like her in person. Most good politicians are quite charismatic in person. In some way, she’s a bit like me. She’s a bit wonkish and a bit awkward. So, maybe we’d get along. But I look at it through two lenses. Number one, the lens of WikiLeaks the publisher, and me as the editor of WikiLeaks. Hillary Clinton’s an interesting person because she was anointed to take the formal executive power of the United States. She had also been Secretary of State. And we had become domain specialists in a variety of ways. Did we pursue collecting documents about Hillary Clinton because of some kind of vendetta or because we perceived that that was where the center of power was heading in the United States, and a lot of people were very interested in where the center of power was heading? It’s not that we thought, well, look, Hillary Clinton, she was involved in putting Chelsea Manning in prison. No. It’s — that’s not the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. We thought our publications were actually going to create a very infuriated Hillary Clinton on the other end that we would have to deal with. So, it’s a kind of — far from that publishing cycle being one of self-interest, it was one of, as far as we foresaw, one of self-sacrifice, because we were infuriating what everyone perceived would be the next executive. If we had wanted to kind of do things for me, we would have praised Hillary Clinton and, you know — and published stuff about her opponent, because everyone was predicting Hillary Clinton would win, including me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. What’s the most realistic path to you getting out of that embassy and actually being free?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, on February 5th, last year, after 16 months of litigation, the UN formally ruled that I am being unlawfully detained and should be immediately freed and compensated. The UK appealed, and we won the appeal in November, so there’s now two rulings at the United Nations level saying that I’m being unlawfully detained in violation of international treaties, which the UK is a party to, and I should be immediately released and compensated. So, I think, you know, it’s entirely political, how much political pressure the United Kingdom and Sweden and Australia perceive that the U.S. security state is placing on them to conduct things in a certain way, and then their own prestige in the situation. So, how can they get out of the situation and still keep face, and how can they get out of the situation and not offend the U.S. security sector? Of course, our publications in relation to the CIA make the equation a lot harder because there will be a perception that they’re likely to offend.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I will note the Director Mike Pompeo, the CIA Director, the day before he gave that speech on Thursday evening before Easter Friday, he was in London. I don’t know what he was doing in London, but he was in London. And there’s a statement in his speech, which is — you know, you can look at that speech as it’s mostly kind of hot air. But there are a couple of important positional revelations. They are his attempts to redefine who is a journalist, who is not; who is a publisher, who is not. There’s a disclosure about the existing case against us, where Pompeo has stated that WikiLeaks instructed Chelsea Manning to go after certain information. That’s an interesting revelation. And then there is his statement that this, i.e., WikiLeaks and its publications, are — end now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, how does he propose to conduct this ending? He didn’t say, but the CIA is only in the business of collecting information, kidnapping people, and assassinating people. So, it’s quite a menacing statement that he does need to clarify. It’s also something that’s false. We did our next CIA publication the next day, together with our partners, Liberation media partner in France and La Republica in Italy. So, I like to joke that the CIA directed Pompeo in his maiden speech, make his first prediction as America’s chief intelligence officer, and it was that WikiLeaks publications would be no more after that speech, and he was proven wrong next day. I think what he was saying, what was ending now was his reputation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Hm. I do hope that we see you as a free man out in the world with the ability to publish.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.

My colleague Laura Poitras, who won the Academy Award for her documentary “Citizenfour” about NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden, she has a new film that’s going to be hitting theaters this summer. Actually, it premieres on May 5\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> in some cities, and it’s the inside story of how Julian Assange came to end up in the Ecuadorian embassy, and his multi-year battles with the U.S. government. And it’s a stunning and revelatory film, and it also has this access to history as it unfolded, which seems to become more and more relevant with every release that WikiLeaks does. The film is called “Risk”.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>“Risk” trailer:\u003c/strong> Oh, hello. Can I please speak to Hillary Clinton? I’m calling from the office of Julian Assange.

This week on Intercepted: Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill analyze Trump’s firing of Comey. If as many Democrats are alleging the FBI director was sacked because of his role in the Russia investigation, Comey could prove to be a lethal threat to Trump’s presidency. Is Trump really that stupid, or does he know something we don’t? Next week, U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning will be released from Fort Leavenworth prison. In an Intercepted exclusive, we will hear Manning in her own voice, describing her imprisonment and why she blew the whistle. Journalist Alexa O’Brien takes us inside the trials and triumphs of the junior soldier who shook the world. The defeat of Marine Le Pen in France’s election was celebrated globally as a rejection of fascism. But who is Emmanuel Macron?

I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 14 of Intercepted. On Tuesday night, the FBI Director James Comey was in Los Angeles, and he saw on television screens news that he had just been fired by President Donald Trump. Trump, simultaneous to the news breaking, reportedly sent a letter to the FBI officially informing James Comey that he was no longer — effective immediately — no longer the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And in Trump’s letter to Comey, he said, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is sort of an incredible statement in and of itself. It’s as though Comey’s job was to fluff Trump about his alleged nonexistent role in the so-called Russia scandal. Trump is referencing a letter that Jeff Sessions supposedly independently sent to Trump, saying he supports the recommendation of the newly appointed Deputy Attorney General, who wrote a memo justifying why James Comey should be removed from office. And in that memo, which has now been made public by the Trump administration, the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, says that “Director Comey” — he’s referring to James Comey here — “I cannot defend the Director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes. It is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.” What he’s referring to is James Comey’s public announcement, in the midst of the final stages of the presidential campaign, that the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails had been closed with no charges being brought.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, of course, Obama was still in power. Loretta Lynch was the Attorney General. Comey said she had a conflict; what he did was proper. The Trump people are now saying, no, that wasn’t, and they cite both Democratic and Republican former attorneys general in supporting this decision. There’s a lot to unpack here. I’m joined by my colleague, and fellow cofounder of The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald, who is with us here in New York for a change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald:\u003c/strong> It’s my debut appearance inside the Intercepted studios. It’s very exciting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So now, Glenn, of course, the Democrats all are immediately piling on, and it’s that Comey was getting too close, the noose was tightening around Trump’s neck over the Russia investigation, and that Comey basically needed to be taken out by Trump before the smoking gun was presented to the American public that would impeach and probably imprison Donald Trump. What’s your immediate reaction to this news?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> I mean, I’m someone who generally doesn’t find much of what Trump has done to be shocking, given what he said he would do during the campaign and who he revealed himself to be. But this actually is shocking. So, as much as I’d like to, I can’t really blame people for scrambling around for an actual theory. The theory that you just identified, which is that, “oh, he had to sabotage Comey, who was about to find or reveal the smoking gun,” makes no sense to me whatsoever. The premise is that James Comey and only James Comey is aware of this smoking gun, and that as long as you fire him, somehow then you prevent its disclosure. When of course, other people who work with Comey, other people in various departments, would also be aware of this evidence if it existed. And James Comey himself, now that he’s fired, could ensure its disclosure. So, that, I don’t find persuasive. But I also don’t find persuasive the DOJ’s explanation for why they did it; namely, these criticism of Comey, many of which are actually valid — namely, that he took it upon himself to decide that the investigation should end.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And he announced that — what the Trump people are basically saying — well, there’s two main components to this. On the one hand, they’re saying, “you were wrong to announce to the public that we’re closing this investigation into the Hillary Clinton email scandal,” which became just the harping point for Trump in the closing stages.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> But it’s a process objection, right? They’re not saying, “You were wrong to close the investigation, although you think that.” They’re saying, “It wasn’t up to you, James Comey. Even if Loretta Lynch couldn’t make it, it was up to somebody else to make it.” So, that’s one objection that is not invalid. And the other one is that when he decided to close the investigation against Hillary Clinton, instead of just saying so, he gave all kinds of opinions about the case that were all very negative to Hillary. And a lot of people think it was wrong for Comey to comment on an investigation that he decided to close. But the thing about it is, even though those criticisms of Comey are valid, the Trump people don’t care about that at all. They loved when he stood up in public and denounced and criticized Clinton once the case was closed, and they don’t care at all about these process objections. So, although I don’t agree with the Democrats that the reason is to prevent Comey from being on the verge of the smoking gun, I also don’t think that the Republican explanations for why this happened are even a small amount valid. And so, it leaves the question, why did this happen and why did it happen now? And I don’t think we know the answer to that yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And let’s remember that there definitely — there’s a lot of smoke, and there’s a little bit of fire with some of the people that agree around Trump: Paul Manafort, you have Carter Page. General Flynn is floating out there in the ether and has reportedly been actively seeking immunity. And I think this is an interesting question about where Flynn resides in all of this, because we haven’t heard from him in public. But remember, General Flynn was the first high profile military figure who had served in a very senior position under Obama and was fired by Obama. He was the first to jump onto the Trump train. He did public interviews with him on the road. He bolstered his military credentials. You know, Trump really was kind of taking Flynn’s lead on a lot of what he was saying about American foreign policy and the military. Flynn may be a lot of things, but he is not an imbecile, and he was around for a lot of private stuff that was happening in Trump land leading up to his election and then leading up to inauguration. I’m just curious if part of this is that there actually is a move to take down not Trump, but that there is some action against someone that’s incredibly important to Trump. They’re concerned that Flynn is flipping, that Comey is — seems to be playing too nice with the Democrats and publicly debunking the President’s tweets in front of Congress. Trump’s a spiteful guy. He wants fierce loyalists. But is it your sense that there is no Russia connection to the firing of James Comey?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> So, again, I mean, there are clearly serious Russia questions when it comes to people like Paul Manafort, who I think primarily has problems because of his financial dealings and undisclosed lobbying work. Carter Page is just some kind of extraterrestrial troll freak that has little to do with the Trump campaign, except in name only, who probably has all kinds of nefarious implications. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if Comey was investigating and making some headway when it comes to people like Manafort, Carter Page, even Roger Stone. Again, though, on the question of was there collusion between the Trump campaign at the highest level, the kind that would get him into serious political trouble and impeach him, and the Russian government, it makes no sense to me whatsoever that if you’re worried that evidence is about to be discovered, that some kind of a smoking gun or something close, that anyone would think that a solution to that would be getting rid of James Comey. He works with dozens of others, investigators, in various agencies, including the Department of Justice, so even if you got rid of him, that evidence isn’t going anywhere. So, that theory just doesn’t seem persuasive to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And then there is the fact that much of what we know about Trump’s, you know, recent public history is from his television show, “The Apprentice,” where the whole point of the show was, “You’re fired, you’re fired, you’re fired, you’re fired.” And so, you know, some of that is at play here. But I do wonder if the Trump people think they’re outmaneuvering the Democrats, the lying fake news media, and that there is some intention of creating this kind of chaos right now as kind of their best defense against any number of legitimate issues that are being probed of this administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> That, I think, makes sense. In other words, if you speak to anybody who’s ever worked with Trump, what they say is he demands this kind of compulsive, unhealthy level of loyalty. Anyone who he thinks is disloyal to him, he fires. So, I think that’s been a big part of what they’ve been doing, is trying to weed out the Sally Yates of the world and people who they think have loyalties elsewhere, and replace them with hardcore Trump loyalists. And I think they seem — James Comey prides himself on not being a loyalist to anybody. And there’s a lot going on at the FBI, and they want someone in there who they trust a lot more than they trust him. That’s what I think makes a lot more sense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think it’s clear that in firing James Comey, if it is related to Russia, either Trump has done the most outrageously stupid thing he could have done by not keeping his enemies closer, and — but turning potentially Comey into an unprecedented sort of whistleblower if he comes out publicly. Or Trump is a genius, and there isn’t anything there with him on Russia. And by firing Comey, he’s gonna send the Democrats into a tizzy, the press into a tizzy. And there will be some, you know, pawns that fall on the board as a result of it, but if Trump really know that there’s no “there” there with his Russia, maybe he is smarter than everybody thinks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, if you look at — you know, if you’re Donald Trump, you have to be pretty comfortable about the question of collusion. You have all kinds of people saying — and not Trump loyalist people like James Clapper and even Dianne Feinstein, two weeks ago to Wolf Blitzer — that look, no, they have not seen evidence of collusion. And if there were evidence of collusion — you know, some kind of intercepted telephone call between some Trump spawn and someone in the Kremlin talking about hacking, you can be damn sure that would have leaked by now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, or — you know, but then there’s also the idea that they have a video of Trump with, you know, prostitutes, or the sort of pee video and all of that. I mean, who — I mean, everything is out there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The last thing I’ll say as we wrap up here, Glenn, is I continue to just be astonished, even though I shouldn’t, at how willing so many cable news journalists, particularly on MSNBC, but also Democrats, are willing to believe any shit that’s flung against the wall of Trump, that it makes that wall look horrible. They’ll believe it. And I think it’s going to undermine the real issues that are there. I think there is a legitimate investigation that should be happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Right. I think we’ve talked about this before, but, you know, it reminds me so much of the Benghazi investigation, where there were serious national security questions about what happened in Benghazi, why they were there, why they ended up killed, that got completely suffocated by the unhinged conspiracy theorizing, and just obsessive fixation the Republicans developed on Benghazi on totally unrelated issues. That, to me, is exactly what is happening when it comes to Russia. All of the legitimate questions that ought to be investigated have been swamped and suffocated, you know, by the Keith Olbermann’s and the Louise Mensch’s of the world, who think that there’s a Putin agent hiding under every corner, and who make all kinds of evidentiary connections — you might want to throw a Rachel Maddow in there too — notwithstanding the fact that there’s no rational basis for doing so. And they look like Glenn Beck in 2010 as they do it, standing at the chalkboard.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Glenn, I do want to also share with our listeners that when we first started The Intercept, you said that you wanted to be paid in rubles. And I appreciate your honesty about who you want your paymasters to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> And I appreciate that you had in your home this massive vault of rubles from the work that you’ve done over the years that you were able to use to pay me. And I appreciate that as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Well, comrade Glenn, I’ll see you at our next summit in Moscow. Glenn Greenwald, thank you for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Great to be with you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn, of course, is my fellow cofounder of The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Next week, on May 17\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, Prisoner 89289 is scheduled to walk out of the Leavenworth military prison in Kansas. Back in 2013, that prisoner was handed the longest sentence ever in U.S. history for being a whistleblower. The bulk of that 35-year sentence, that was handed down at the end of a U.S. military court marshal, was commuted by President Barack Obama. The prisoner I’m talking about is U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, there’s a lot of talk in the news right now about leaks, and about Julian Assange, and about WikiLeaks. And we hear from Julian Assange. He is able to respond to allegations against him. We hear from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Both of them were on our show last season. But we almost never have heard from Chelsea Manning since she was arrested in 2010 by the U.S. military in Iraq. We have almost never heard her voice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She was arrested while on active duty in the Army on suspicion that she had been the source for what at the time was the most explosive series of national security leaks in U.S. government history. Chelsea Manning was ultimately charged by the military and presented with an avalanche of allegations, charges, including very serious ones, like aiding the enemy. The documents that she admitted in court to providing to WikiLeaks beginning in 2010 included hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. State Department cables, videos of U.S. military forces bombing or gunning down civilians, war crimes committed by U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. She uncovered covert wars, the U.S. attempt to conceal its role in the bombing of Yemen, beginning in the first year of the Obama administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Since 2010, Manning has been held in various prisons and facilities, beginning in Iraq, then Kuwait, then back to the United States. And while she was in the custody of the military before her court marshal, she alleged that she was, at times, abused by her jailers. Some of the worst episodes, she says, occurred when she was held by U.S. Marines in Quantico, Virginia before her trial. When Chelsea Manning was arrested, no recording equipment was allowed in court. Many of the publications that benefited from her whistleblowing, they put it on the front pages of their newspapers — they barely covered her trial. The narrative about who Chelsea Manning was and who she is has been largely set by the military, by the government, and also by cable news. Coverage of her has not, for the most part, focused on what she or why she did it. But rather, what is presented is this sort of despicable fixation on the fact that Chelsea Manning is transitioning from living as a man to living as a woman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill O’Reilly:\u003c/strong> You know this guy Bradley Manning?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Fox News:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BOR:\u003c/strong> Yeah.

When can we start calling you Andrea?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FN:\u003c/strong> The Associated Press, NBC, and The New York Times agreeing to call Manning “she.” But he’s not a she.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FN:\u003c/strong> Technically, on just definitional grounds, technically, it’s a he.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We recently obtained several hours of secretly recorded audio from the court-martial of Chelsea Manning. Now, there have been a couple of other leaks of audio from those proceedings, but most of what you’re going to hear today from her has never before been broadcast. To discuss all of this, to discuss Chelsea Manning, her whistleblowing, her trial, and her treatment at the hands of her jailers, we’re joined now by the researcher, and writer, Alexa O’Brien. She was the most dogged journalist covering the Manning trial, and because of her and her work, much of what we do know about what happened in those proceedings is because she was there. At times, actually, Alexa slept in her car outside of Fort Meade as she worked around the clock covering this trial. Alexa O’Brien, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alexa O’Brien:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How did Chelsea Manning describe her treatment at Quantico?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> There were several different episodes at Quantico. She — what I’ve heard from, you know, being in the courtroom and listening to her discuss it, she just discussed the sort of play-by-play of how she sort of tried to reason with the military brig that she was in in Quantico, Virginia, and the way in which they reacted to her.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chelsea Manning:\u003c/strong> I tried to feel as much like I wasn’t trapped in, like, a cage or a cell. I tried to feel like I wasn’t trapped in there, that I still know where I am, I know my environment. And I would just try to stay active. And I’d try to keep from falling asleep because they — that was a rule. You were not allowed to sleep, or look like even the appearance of sleep was considered sleeping, so you couldn’t close your eyes or anything like that, so —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> Well, legally, she was unlawfully punished before her pre-trial. She only got 112 days’ sentencing credit for it, but, you know, legally, her treatment was extreme. She was not officially legally in stat — I’m sorry, solitary confinement, but one could look at her conditions and consider them solitary confinement. She was segregated from the rest of the population. What was weird about her circumstance is that she was placed in a temporary facility, a Marine Corps facility. She was a U.S. Army Private. She was a long-term pre-trial. You know, she was up for charges on espionage. She wasn’t getting out of pre-trial confinement. And she was also known to be gay. And then also, there was — at that time, the military knew that she had gender dysphoria, so, you know — gender identity issues. I think her treatment was unfair.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, though, looking at it from a sort of structural managerial point of view, I think that the military — it was also a bit of a clash of cultures. You know, they’re a very fraternal sort of organization, and even from the testimony of people, you know, they wanted her to talk. And she wasn’t talking. And I think that they resented that. Because she’s a soldier, she should tell them what happened, you know? And her lawyer told her to keep her mouth shut. So, what’s interesting about how Manning describes it is that she’s actually very respectful of her chain of command, her current chain of command. And she’s not a rabble-rouser or a provocateur. She’s actually somebody who really cared about the mission and wants to get along with people. So, she wasn’t exactly sitting in the courtroom saying like, “Aw, I’m a victim.” She was just sort of reciting what had happened and her treatment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Judge:\u003c/strong> What about service discrediting? Do you think that the — your conduct in giving the video to WikiLeaks was service discrediting?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Yes, your honor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Judge:\u003c/strong> Why?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Well, for the service discrediting, it’s about public perception of the military and services, and our ability to — and their trust and their perception that we can safeguard our sensitive information for their protection. So, by not abiding by those — by the system, it undermines our service, your honor, and their perception of how we operate now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Judge:\u003c/strong> Okay. So basically, if I’m understanding what you’re understanding correctly, is, you know, people — the military would hope that people have confidence in the system and the people in it to follow the rules, and basically, if you don’t have any rules or people weren’t following the rules — I mean, if there’s more than one person that’s doing what you’re doing, then the whole system crashes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Yes, your honor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, when Julian Assange or WikiLeaks discuss this case, they still refer to Chelsea Manning as the alleged source of the — a variety of documents. The most public and perhaps the one that made the biggest splash initially was the “Collateral Murder” video that depicted a U.S. helicopter gunship gunning down some Iraqi civilians and also media workers from the Reuters news agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>“Collateral Murder” Audio\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Haven’t seen anything since then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Just fucking – once you get on, just open up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> I am.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> You’re clear.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> All right. I’m firing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Line here, stay in line now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Let me know when you have them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Let’s shoot. Light ‘em all up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> 002, traffic 260 –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Come on, fire! [Gunshots]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Roger. [Gunshots]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your understanding of the origin of this story? Like, how did that video end up broadcast to the world? What do we know from Chelsea Manning’s own telling of the story and from your journalism? Like, how did we get to — from the point where WikiLeaks puts out this video, or the State Department cables, or the Iraq War logs, or the Afghan War logs, to Chelsea Manning being arrested by the military?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> The first time that Chelsea Manning saw that video, she was actually watching a couple people in her intelligence shop discussing the video. They had found it on a shared drive from the previous, you know, group of folks that had been in Iraq before them. And she was sort of being instructed on it. But they didn’t really talk about standard operating procedures or the rules of warfare with regards to it. They were really just sort of talking about it in a general way. So, what Manning did, according to what we know from the court record, she looked at it, and at first, she said that she really was numb, but she started to do research on it, and she realized that this was actually video that Reuters had been trying to obtain regarding two of their employees, because two Reuters employees were killed in this incident.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, she really did her homework. You know, when she gave that to WikiLeaks, she also gave them the rules for engagement for that time period. I’m not sure if I remember if they were classified or unclassified, but, you know, this is not somebody who was willy-nilly, just like, you know, like an anarchist just, like, throwing stuff around.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, that — the video comes out and of course is covered across the globe by media outlets around the world. And it really was — I think for many people, it was the first time they heard of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in terms of how much media attention it got. What happened after that video was released in Manning’s life and time in Iraq?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> I think that’s really when Manning probably started to — and I hate to use this term, but started to sort of unravel a bit. Unravel in the sense of, like, the way that sometimes it’s good to unravel, you know? Meaning to say that she realized sort of the impact that it had, to some degree, and obviously, she was undergoing a confrontation within herself at the time around her gender identity issues, according to the court-martial. And it coincided maybe with her understanding of the sort of greater truth of who she was as a soldier in Iraq. You know, that kind of Catch-22 scenario of Manning. April 5, 2010 is when WikiLeaks published that. She was arrested in May. May 20\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, I think, is when she was arrested, so a month later. So, this is really when sort of like the climax of her leaking, you know, in Iraq. Around the same time, she’s — when WikiLeaks is publishing this video, she’s— in April, she is actually uploading Granai airstrike stuff — pictures, encrypted video. So, she was really sort of in full bloom at that point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, it’s interesting, because I’ve, like yourself, I’ve followed these events very carefully and closely. And, you know, you, to this moment, including probably most prominently in recent times, when it became clear that Obama was gonna commute a large chunk of the 35-year prison sentence —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> With respect to Chelsea Manning, I looked at the particulars of this case, the same way I have the other commutations and pardons that I’ve done. And I felt that in light of all the circumstances, that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You then had this parade of people on cable news saying Chelsea Manning is a traitor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Andrea Tantaros:\u003c/strong> She is the greatest — one of the biggest and greatest traitors in United States history, and probably — and some countries would be subjected to a firing squad. Instead, we’re paying for a gender selection surgery. That’s all I’m gonna say.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yes, it caused problems diplomatically for the U.S. and its allies, and it sounds like she herself acknowledged that in the trial. But it also revealed for the American people some of the inner workings of what their government does in their name around the world. I can understand why she would say it was the one that she was most concerned about, but if you can’t prove that she — I don’t mean you, but if these people can’t prove that actual damage was done in that way, and you can prove that necessary facts were brought to light, I think it makes it a much more complicated case than, “Oh, this person is a traitor.” You could make an argument that that is in a democratic spirit of a free society that’s obsessed with secrecy and over-classification. But what do you say to people that use that term to describe Chelsea Manning, saying, “She’s a traitor”?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> The first thing I say is like, I appreciate that you’re angry. You know, Manning, it was a soldier, and there is an importance to unit cohesiveness, and there is a kind of fraternal order to the military. I’m not against the fraternal order to the military. And to tell you the truth, I also think people are entitled to their opinion. You know, if you take provocative acts like this, there are consequences, you know. We live in a society, there’s a thing called social consensus, blah, blah, blah, blah. Legally, though, she’s not a traitor. You know, democracies love to have traitor trials. You know, like, you can — back to ancient Athens. So, like, I don’t think that it’s atypical to have these kinds of things. At the same time, though, trials are really important, because that is where the boundaries are. You know, for me, it’s funny, like people oftentimes say, “Oh, you’re a Manning supporter.” And yes, I — Manning earned my respect because she deserved it, through the court-martial process. Anybody under that kind of circumstance who handles themselves with such dignity, has respect for the proceeding, isn’t sitting there like talking to every media outlet, is really focusing on that important institution and the judicial kind of component of society. Yeah, I support her. I support that she has a fair trial.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When you say legally, she’s not a traitor, what do you mean?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> She was acquitted of aiding the enemy. The government went to court.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, really? Because I don’t think any of the people that were commenting on the day Obama made his announcement are aware of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, really — I mean, I watched the coverage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> I know. I know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wall-to-wall, and it’s incredible. It’s stated as fact. You know, she was — you know, there are people that all say, “Well, she was convicted of treason and aiding the enemy.” I mean, but —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> She wasn’t, and it was a big deal that she was acquitted, because it really would have actually threatened every U.S. citizen — really, any person in the world. Because aiding the enemy is an any-person’s offense. So, essentially, what that means is that anybody could be charged under — in a military tribunal for aiding the enemy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to cut to the — a question that I think is — we’ll hear in her own words when she gets out. But what’s your understanding of what was going on in her head at the time, and what her motive was for doing this, for leaking all of this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> My personal observation as a, you know, human being sort of looking at another person, listening to how they describe their experiences in the courtroom and what other people say, is Manning was very young. You have to also remember that. And she was highly intelligent, to some degree, meaning to say she had a sort of passionate intensity about life. She also had a really difficult upbringing. And I realize that that’s — I’m not painting her out as a victim. I’m just saying that she was in the middle of processing all the kinds of stuff. I don’t remember — I don’t know if you remember when you were, you know, in your early 20s, but life is pretty intense when you’re at that age, and you’re like, you know, thinking about the world, and everything is learning how to negotiate in the adult world and blah, blah, blah, blah. Her first deployment. Then she’s also, you know, sort of struggling with — she joined the military.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Interestingly enough, they found in her dorm, it’s called a CHU in Iraq, her Compartmentalized Housing Unit — this scholarly treatise written by an Air Force psychiatrist about the fact that — it’s called “Flight Into Hypermasculinity,” where it talks about there’s a higher proportion of people who are assigned men but identify as women in the military than there is in the general population. A lot of times, they join the military to try to rid themselves of these feelings. I think what I’m trying to say is that you can’t divorce the political/moral/ethical thing from the interpersonal. She also was tasked to learn about — she’s a young intelligence analyst, so she’s being told to read the State Department cables, and do this and that. And you’re talking about a very earnest person who might be very literal in their thinking, who cares about the mission. And her coworkers said that about her. She really cared about the mission. Perfectionist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, like, you’re putting together a young person who has a certain level of experience in how the world works. You know, in reality, she sees all this sort of devastation and pain and suffering. Someone who’s probably experienced to some degree what it feels like to be on the receiving end of, you know, pain and suffering; being gay in Oklahoma, no offense to anybody from Oklahoma, but, you know, being trans and not being able to admit it. So, there’s all these things going on. And she begins to sort of go toward releasing it, because ultimately, Manning believed that if the public knew — it’s not that she was a pacifist. She says she’s not a pacifist. But that they would have a better sense of what was going on, and be able to make better policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> After the release, I was concerned about the impact of the video and how it would be perceived by the general public. I hoped that the video would be — I hoped that the public would be as alarmed as me about the conduct of the air — aerial weapons team crewmembers. I wanted the American public to know that not everyone in Iraq and Afghanistan are targets that needed to be neutralized, but rather, people who were struggling to live in the pressure cooker environment of what we call asymmetric warfare.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At what point does the former hacker turned FBI informant Adrian Lamo come on the scene?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> He comes on the scene on May 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, a couple days before she’s arrested. When Manning saw that Lamo had made a public statement about WikiLeaks — so at this point, you know, WikiLeaks has published “Collateral Murder.” They started to talk because they’re — Lamo had certain sort of sexual identity things that he had talked about, and Manning is trying to relate to people, you know. Lonely in Iraq, dealing with a lot of — you know, under a lot of pressure. And what ended up happening was that discussion, Lamo had presented himself as a journalist and a preacher even at one point, so there were all these, like, notions of, like, protection, source protection.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And how were they communicating?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> They were communicating over AOL chat or IRC chat. I forget which mechanism. Anyway, within like, the day that Manning contacted Lamo, before any statement was made regarding any leaks, Lamo had already contacted a friend in Army counterintelligence. So, you know, Manning was essentially done at that point. And of course, in the course of revealing all this stuff, what happened with Manning is — and what put her in a really vulnerable position, she was wide open when the Army arrested her. You know, she had no access to explain her narrative, what was really going on. And she had put out all this personal stuff in this chat log, so it just — it didn’t look good.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At that point, did the Army — was Manning already under suspicion of being behind this —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before she started talking with Adrian Lamo?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> To my understanding: No. No, she wasn’t. And I only say that because maybe there’s classified material that I haven’t seen. No, and I really think this is what really did her in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, what were the circumstances when she was arrested?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> So, you know, obviously, the U.S. Army counterintelligence and CID, which is the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Army, they were, like, you know, busy trying to figure out who this person is, where she was stationed, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It wasn’t that hard because of the identifying information she gave to Lamo. So, she was arrested, and because of Adrian Lamo’s representations to the media that she had leaked top-secret information, which she absolutely had not, she was put into pre-trial confinement and brought to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait. And, you know, when she was there, she was originally put with other soldiers, but she was placed in administrative segregation when she told them that she was gay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>David Coombs:\u003c/strong> Now, on June 30, 2010, do you recall losing control of yourself on that day, to the point that medical doctors, medical health professionals, had to intervene?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Very limited memory of that very day. I just remember being told about that, mostly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Do you recall yelling uncontrollably, screaming, shaking, babbling, banging your head against your cell, and mumbling?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Those details, no, but I knew that I had just fallen apart. I mean, I — everything’s foggy and hazy from that time period, sir.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> Even Quantico. I mean, we could talk about, oh, Manning was segregated because the Army wanted to break her down. I think there was an element of also homophobia going on there too. So, she was placed in administrative segregation in this case, and, you know, her hours were switched. She was — she started to deteriorate. She had no access to her lawyer. She started to mentally have a breakdown.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> And do you recall, during this time, making a noose out of bed sheets?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Vaguely. I mean, I just — I remember — I mean, I don’t remember that particular — I remember being taken out and them finding that. I just remember my stuff being all over the place. After they started doing the shakedowns, I stopped. I stopped making my bed and things, you know, because it was getting — they were just carrying up all my stuff all the time anyway. So, I don’t recall making it, but I remember thinking, you know, I’m gonna die inside here, you know, in this cage, and I don’t know what’s gonna happen. But I mean, I thought I was gonna die in that cage. And that’s how I saw it, as like an animal cage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> And so, she had one suicide attempt in Camp Arifjan, which, even when was brought later to Quantico, the brig psychiatrists themselves said that she wasn’t suicidal anymore. But the Army kept her on this prevention of injury, sort of as a justification for, you know, her treatment. So, she’s in Camp Arifjan, and she starts to have a mental breakdown. You know, she’s facing these like really serious charges, blah, blah, blah, blah. They keep her there for — oh, god, July. So, she’s there between May — late May to July, she’s at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait. Then they bring her to Quantico. Her testimony about Quan — the move, how she was transported, you know, in shackles and — she was actually really grateful to be in the United States. She said in her court marshal that she wasn’t sure if they were gonna send her to Guantanamo Bay. So, she was definitely worried about that kind of stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> And how were you feeling at that point when you knew that you were going to be going to the States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> I felt a lot better. I mean, I didn’t think I was gonna set foot on American soil for a long time, so — I was elated. I mean, as silly as it sounds, it felt a lot better, you know, knowing that. So, I — and it was great to be in familiar surroundings, on American soil, BWI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was it like covering that trial? What was it like in the courtroom?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> What was going on in the courtroom, I think people let go of this because Manning was a low-level, you know — so, some people looked at it as like a troubled character, not very hip, slick, and cool, kind of left themselves wide open. I mean, Manning was everybody’s pawn, you know? It’s like, Snowden can’t come to the United States and have a trial because Manning’s treatment. It’s like, nobody gives a shit if she’s actually being treated well or not. It’s like, it sounds good. It’s great propaganda. I thought also, it wasn’t just about Manning. It’s about us. You know, this is our country. This is an important — an important trial. We need to know what’s going on here. I understand people are angry and everyone’s freaking out, and people are using Manning, and — including WikiLeaks and all — everybody, you know? Like, fundamentally, though, like what the hell happened? You know? Let’s find that out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the things — it’s not just about Manning personally. When they were discussing the legal interpretation of aiding the enemy, which hadn’t been really done since the Civil War, the U.S. Civil War era in the late 1800s, there are consequences for prosecuting a soldier with aiding the enemy that will affect everyone in society. You are setting a precedent for prosecuting someone under, if there is a certain standard, you know, threshold standard of evidence for publishing information that a terrorist organization — you know, if they’re able to obtain any intelligence. And intelligence is an interesting legal concept. It means anything that’s useful and true. And, you know, that — well, that — it doesn’t even apply just to classified information, that you can bring someone into a court of law and accuse them of aiding the enemy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I don’t think a lot of people know the story of how we ended up even having transcripts of the proceedings against Chelsea Manning. Start from the beginning about what — sort of the first moment you realized something’s rotten in Denmark here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> The information, much of it was published on the Internet, although it was still legally classified. So, there were large portions that were central to her — elements of her criminal charges that the public could not impeach with their own analysis. The unfortunate thing about that is that the government was in complete control of the message coming out of Fort Meade. You know, if you were a member of the press at Fort Meade, you were essentially escorted by security at all times. It’s almost, it was almost better to go as a member of the public because you didn’t have, like, military guards around you. And, you know, they wanted to portray — their sort of narrative was like, “embittered homosexual angry at Army.” Like, that was, like, the Manning message. And there was a more important story that needed to be told. So, the secrecy impeded public understanding.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then you had the sort of competing interests of, you know, capitalist media, and just, also just — we don’t even need to use the word ‘capitalism.’ We could just use people looking for money, property, prestige, you know? Where they’re trying to like, get the, you know, gotcha story. And in all of that, public deliberation about this important court marshal was sort of getting lost.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We only have heard Manning’s voice in very small snippets that were leaked out of the proceedings. But having been there for all of this, when she finally did speak and described why she did what she did, what was your big takeaway from her own words?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO\u003c/strong>: I say this so repeatedly, I sometimes feel like people don’t think I can have like, original thinking, or like, think beyond one thought. But she’s incredibly earnest. Yeah, Manning was a humanist, you know, and that’s a really fancy sort of word for like, she didn’t want to hurt anybody. I think that she — first of all, she’s more of a soldier than I think people realize. When they hear her voice talk, you know, she’s been in the military a very long time, even if it’s in a prison. And she’s said publicly that she’s not a pacifist, you know. She’s — she didn’t join the military because she was a pacifist. She is a thoughtful person. She’s very meticulous in her thinking. She talked about how much she respected her chain of command. She even talked about how much she liked the Marine at Quantico who was playing mind games with her, her counselor, telling her or asking her, you know, “why are you still on suicide, you know, risk — or sorry, prevention of injury watch?” When that counselor knew that he was the one who was putting her on it because the psychiatrist was saying, “Take her off.” She talked about what a great Marine he was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Manning — and I think defense sort of represented it this way. Manning was good to everybody. She got mistreated because of her, you know — what people thought of her. But she was the type of person who was always concerned about other people. And that’s the kind of person I saw on the stand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On reflection, what do you think we, as a society, should learn from the whole thing? What Chelsea Manning did, what happened in her trial, the sentence she received, and then this 11\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> hour commutation of most of the sentence by Obama?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> Mercy is not — mercy and earnestness are not the way of the weak. You know, I think there’s a lot of strength in mercy. There’s a lot of strength in trusting that if you are able to look at a situation clearly without hysteria, or that — you know, you’re gonna show you’re a weak person, and I don’t think that’s true. I think there’s a lot of wisdom in mercy and fair sentences, first of all. And then also, on a kind of personal — the big takeaway for me is that: Manning played a really earnest case in a military court-martial, and she’s out of prison. And I think that that’s like — I think moral tales are really important. Maybe they’re not true. But they’re really important for liberal democracies because they sort of like, set the bar for how we’re supposed to treat each other. So, I think the fact that Manning was an earnest character and that she played a really tight case — that she didn’t sort of propagandize herself to the media, that she sort of respected the institutions of society, was the counterbalance to the unilateralism of leaking. Trials are important. Fair trials are even more important to liberal democracies. So, the takeaway is that the good person who is virtuous won. And I think that’s an important concept in sort of justice. It may not always be the truth, but it feels good when it actually happens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hm. Well, Alexa O’Brien, I’ve always admired the work that you’ve done, and I often publicly cite your work because I think it was so — it was like a classroom, I think, for a lot of people, to see how a human being covers something so complicated as this. So, I just wanted to thank you in person for that, and also thank you for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AO:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alexa O’Brien is an independent researcher and writer focusing on national security and law enforcement. When we come back, we’re gonna go to France. There’s a great celebration that the fascist candidate, Marine Le Pen, was defeated last week in that country’s presidential election. But who is the victor, Emmanuel Macron? Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And we are back here on Intercepted. Emmanuel Macron’s defeat of Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election on Sunday is being portrayed as a triumph of sane people over far-right extremism, proof that the wave of so-called nationalist populism in the West can be stopped. Le Pen would not replicate the great Trump shocker. In France, the narrative goes, the reasonable candidate won, unlike in the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter:\u003c/strong> Well, French voters dealt a massive repudiation, not just to Marine Le Pen, but to the anti-immigrant, anti-European politics that she represents. Looks like that populist wave that had washed across the U.S. and Britain has crashed here tonight on French shores.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But that’s a radically oversimplified narrative. Who actually is Emmanuel Macron, and what does his win actually mean? He billed himself as a business-minded centrist, a political outsider, neither right nor left. But the situation in France is far more complex than Macron’s campaign. He won a lesser of two evils election that many French people didn’t even turn out for. The anti-immigrant, Islamophobic vitriol of Marine Le Pen that aided Macron’s victory because it was so public and because it was so vile. But many of the underlying sentiments that Le Pen bombastically advocated — they’ve already been on a steady rise in the mainstream of French politics: The building up of a surveillance state. The targeting of Muslims. The militarization of law enforcement. In that regard, France is not so different from the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss all of this, we go now to Paris, where we’re joined by Yasser Louati. He is a French human rights and civil liberties activist. And his work lately has focused around national security policies, Islamophobia, and social justice for minorities in France. Yasser, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Yasser Louati:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, what’s your analysis of what happened in this election, and who Macron is and what he represents?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YL:\u003c/strong> Well, actually, the rise of Emmanuel Macron was a clear indication that there is a political vacuum in France. That a person can go from being a completely unknown to everybody in the country to becoming president within 18 months signals that it was just a way for him to navigate through the failures of our system, the weaknesses of the existing politicians in power. And as for him being described as neither a left or right, to my humble analysis, to me, that’s just a very sane capitalist approach, because the choices are there. It is either fascism on the one hand, and if you want to do a bit better, you choose Emmanuel Macron, who’s going to lock you into the proletarian of the digital age.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Loosely speaking, in the United States, part of the argument that supporters of Hillary Clinton were making to the anti-war, pro-civil liberties, anti-neoliberal economics left was, we have to stop Trump from taking power, so even if you don’t like Hillary, you should vote for her so that we don’t get Trump. Was that part of the sentiment in France as well?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YL:\u003c/strong> Yes, definitely. It is not a coincidence that 14 million people decided to abstain from voting. You know, it makes you feel that, you know, the oligarchs in any country want to make sure that there is a rise of the far-right in order to hold you hostage and tell you, well, you have no other choice. It’s either us or the evil candidate from the far-right. Well, the Americans chose Donald Trump, and we saw — and we are seeing the results on a daily basis. But in France, the victory of Emmanuel Macron tastes very bitter, because the whole country was deprived of a sane political campaign. What’s happening in France is similar to what’s happening in many Western so-called liberal democracies, is that the political system has completely failed, and that we are always engaging to holding people hostages, to leave them with no other choice. And that’s what makes Marine Le Pen now a person you cannot ignore, and that she’s here to stay, and her ideas are here to stay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, it’s interesting, because former U.S. president Barack Obama recorded a video.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BO:\u003c/strong> I’m not planning to get involved in many elections now that I don’t have to run for office again. But the French election is very important to the future of France and the values that we care so much about. Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward. En Marche! Vive la France!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Obama has only said a handful of things about President Donald Trump, and has largely been either on vacation or staying quiet. What was your analysis of Obama’s video advocating for Macron?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YL:\u003c/strong> To be honest, I didn’t like it at all. It was interference from a former American president. It was not welcome. I do not know under what title, under what merit he thinks he can intervene in this election, and if, you know, his voice would somehow help Emmanuel Macron, especially when we know the legacy of Barack Obama in terms of militarization of the police in America, with the mass surveillance, the explosion in drone attacks around the world, and of course, the empowering of the military industrial complex. So, if a person like Barack Obama, who was held as a symbol of progress in the U.S., thinks, you know, he can send a positive message here in France, for me, it wasn’t welcome, and generally speaking, in France, it did not weigh that much. You know, we spoke about it here and there, but it did not get that much attention.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the main points of emphasis in the global news media about Marine Le Pen was this issue of her anti-immigration stance, her racism, the Islamophobia of her party. And of course, that is also some of the focus on Donald Trump in the United States. Break down for us what France was already like before you were facing the possibility of Marine Le Pen on issues of xenophobia, anti-immigrant movements or sentiment, and Islamophobia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YL:\u003c/strong> Laws began being passed specifically targeting Muslims. For example, in 1987, there was the first review of the citizenship code, because it was a few years after the second generation of French Muslims marched and demanded equality. Then we had the 2004 law excluding Muslim girls wearing a headscarf from public schools, and then the law was extended to their mothers, should they want to attend school fieldtrips. And then it was extended to prevent Muslim nannies from working from home. You can’t even work in France if you’re wearing a headscarf as a Muslim woman, etc. All of that was adopted under a mainstream right party. The law on surveillance — we had had the criminalization of the BDS movement, the criminalization of social movements, the militarization of the police, the attempt to even change the French Constitution in order to strip from their citizenship; people who are convicted of acts of terror, meaning that if a person is charged with terrorism and convicted: He loses his citizenship.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We can make a very simple comparison with historic terrorist groups. When terrorism was white in the 1950s, nobody spoke about revoking their citizenship, even if they had attempted to overthrow the president, Charles de Gaulle. Nobody tried to remove — to revoke the citizenship of the far-left white terrorists in the ‘60s and ‘70s, and the list goes on. But the day terrorism went from white to brown, then it became a question of identity. And that’s why the supporters of Marine Le Pen are an indication that it’s not a question of the far-right rising. No, it’s a question of the growing adhering to far-right ideas from, again, the whole political spectrum in France.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, you know, of course, when you look at someone like Marine Le Pen, it’s almost like a sickening cartoon version of a political figure, in the sense that she is so overt about her agenda of hatred. But now that we have the reality of Emmanuel Macron, what do you see as the dangers that his ascent to power represents?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YL:\u003c/strong> The deep divide along racial and social lines in France, and the fact that the racist rhetoric has been so normalized in France and so acceptable within the political elite, or within mainstream media, that it will take beyond human courage to go against that. The other danger is that he will inherit a police state that has been passed in the 30 years. All of them greatly expanding the powers of the executive, weakening our justice system, and instead, at least from learning the lesson of mass surveillance and being, you know, spied on by their own allies, France passes this law to put on surveillance the whole country. All your digital information is gathered in one single file held by the government that the government itself can share with the whole of the European Union and Interpol. That’s a very dangerous step, yet that’s where we are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And of course, the current state of emergency. The figures are staggering. 4,200 raids have been carried. Only six inquiries on terror-related charges have been launched so far. And you have, for example, a state official saying that we have been targeting visibly practicing Muslims. And this is when racism comes in handy to pass repressive measures. And to implement totalitarian regimes, you begin by scapegoating minorities and holding them as that extraordinary enemy requiring extraordinary powers. But after passing all these laws on the back of the ethnic neighborhoods that we call the \u003cem>banlieue\u003c/em> here in France, on the back of Muslims in the so-called war against terror, these measures have been extended to our anarchist friends, to the union leaders, to environmentalists. And that has been so normal that we have held several elections, and with a state of emergency, and nobody is asking the question, what are we doing? It’s been over a year-and-a-half. The state of emergency has failed. It did not prevent any terrorist attack. And at the same time, we are implementing what we call a totalitarian state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, in the United States, of course, we have — there’s a lot of racial profiling, and also profiling of Muslims, particularly in the case of our airports. And of course, Donald Trump, you know, is still continuing to try to push through his Muslim ban. You know, he’s had to revise it, and he’s battling our courts right now in the United States. But, you know, we’ve published secret U.S. government documents showing that Muslims are targeted in disproportionate numbers in the terror watchlisting system in the United States. Is that the situation in France as well for Muslims?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YL:\u003c/strong> The racial profiling thing, in our case in France, is directly inherited from France’s colonial past. You know, I know the U.S. — I went to school in the U.S., so I’m quite familiar with the romantic view people have of France and you know, hugs and you know, perfume, etc. But the reality is that France is a colonial republic. And the current republic we live under, called the Fifth Republic, had its constitution adopted in 1958 in the midst of the bloody repression of the liberation movements in the colonies, which means that our institutions today work according to a colonial model. So, it is no coincidence that if you are a black or an Arab person in France, you are 20 times more likely of being racially profiled by the police. If you are a Muslim person in France, you are four times less likely of receiving a positive answer to your job application.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, there are deep roots for racism in France. It is structural. And the reason why Emmanuel Macron will not be capable of tackling these issues today, because he has not been as ambitious as to push for a new constitution, a post-colonial, a post-racial constitution that will recognize once and for all that France is not a white-only country. And it has a huge debt to the black and brown and Muslims who not only freed it from the Nazis while its white elite was collaborating with Hitler and sending the Jews to the death camps, but also rebuilt the country after the Second World War. The people who were brought to France from the former colonies were brought here to work and rebuild the country. So, I hope you see the extent of the problem, and that its different manifestations, be it the fear-mongering to justify security measures, the constant singling out of communities: They all go back to a colonial republic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right.

Maybe the most extreme allegations about him are true: he is a Russian asset, compromised, taking orders from Moscow. He definitely is hiding all sorts of information about his finances. Regardless, it is clear he is wildly incompetent with no interest in even trying to understand his current job or the rules that govern it. Or maybe, Donald Trump is just an idiot. This week on Intercepted, investigative journalist Marcy Wheeler and The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald analyze the latest insanity emanating from the White House. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tim Weiner and Intercept writer Trevor Aaronson discuss the firing of James Comey and debate his FBI legacy. And Palestinian author and journalist Rula Jebreal explains why President Trump is going to Saudi Arabia and Israel on his first international trip.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Donald J.

Just spoke with the head of the FBI. We had a very nice dinner. I said, “If it’s possible, would you let me know?” And at that time, he told me, “I’ll tell you this: no, I’m not doing that. I think that…well, I think that looking into me and the campaign — there’s so many investigations, I want to get to the bottom.” I said to him myself, I said, “You know…”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>The Scarecrow:\u003c/strong> Then perhaps I’ll deserve you and be even worthy of you\u003cbr />\nif I only had a brain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill:\u003c/strong> This is Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City, and this is episode 15 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I probably maybe will confuse people. Maybe I’ll expand that. You know, I’ll lengthen the time, because it should be over with. It should, in my opinion, it should have been over with a long time ago. Because all it is is an excuse. But I said to myself, I might even lengthen out the investigation. But I have to do the right thing for the American people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think we’ve come to a point in the Trump presidency where we need to take very seriously the strong possibility that when it comes to the most basic elements of being president, Donald Trump is a bona fide idiot. It truly appears that he’s not even trying to figure out how to be president. He’s just a failure by almost every possible measure. Now, I’m not saying that there is no possibility that there are dark secrets in need of exposing about Donald Trump. I mean, certainly, there are. His financial dealings remain totally shrouded in secrecy. The firing of the FBI Director James Comey is undoubtedly an ominous development. You have senior members of Trump’s campaign team and some that are still in his administration that have a lot to answer for, particularly when it comes to their dealings with various Russian officials. Now, maybe there is some lurid or scandalous truth about Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that will one day be revealed. Maybe. But what we know, because it’s sitting there in plain sight in front of all of us, is that this guy is not in control. Or rather, he is in control, and it’s a complete and total train-wreck. He doesn’t read his intelligence briefings. He needs the world explained to him with basically cartoons that have to fit on one page, or he’s gonna lose attention. He seems to genuinely not understand how government works, or what the Constitution actually says. Donald Trump’s behavior around world leaders is buffoonish, and it’s embarrassing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, by all means, let’s have aggressive investigations of Trump from all angles. But it’s long past due that we recognize the obvious — that when it comes to just basic issues of competency, Trump is a clown. The latest scandal revolves around this bizarre meeting that Trump had with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and Moscow’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. Trump had that meeting the day after he fired FBI Director Comey. Now, just on a basic level, the timing of that meeting was unforgivably dumb, just on the level of optics, on the most basic level. But then, Trump bars the U.S. press from coming into that meeting, even to take the little pictures at the beginning of it. But he does allow in a Russian photographer. And it’s because of the pictures that the Russian photographer released that we even knew that Ambassador Kislyak was in the meeting. Trump was not going to tell us that. His administration was not going to release that fact. And Kislyak is one of the main figures at the center of this whole Russia affair. Now, maybe this was a nefarious, super secret meeting, where Trump was going to spill state secrets to the Russians because they have him compromised. They have the pee tape. He has secret financial dealings in Russia. Maybe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But set all of that aside for a second and consider the obvious. Trump is arrogant. Trump likes to brag. And Trump has proven to be a buffoon as president of the United States. The man has diarrhea of the brain. Whatever pops into his head is gonna come shooting out of his mouth. Or he’s gonna just tweet it. What’s way more likely than Trump intentionally divulging anything classified to the Russians because he’s compromised or actively working with Moscow to undermine the United States is that he is as he seems. He’s the village idiot who somehow ended up as president. And this is not actually a funny situation. In fact, it’s a quite dangerous situation, given the views, the publicly espoused views of Trump and his team on a wide range of foreign and domestic issues: their view of poor people; their view of immigrants, both documented and undocumented; their views of Islam and Muslims; their views of foreign policy; their views of healthcare. What we already know and can prove is frightening enough. And I’m far more worried about the damage they can do with whatever time they have in the White House than I am about what the Russians are going to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When the story of Trump divulging sensitive information to the Russians in the Oval Office broke, the White House response was, in typical Trump administration fashion, a complete shit show of contradictions, denials, and then next-day tweets that make everyone in this country wonder what the hell we’re witnessing. To try to make even a shred of sense of this, I’m joined by two people. Marcy Wheeler, who runs the excellent website emptywheel.net, and Glenn Greenwald, who is my fellow cofounder of The Intercept. Marcy, Glenn, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Marcy Wheeler:\u003c/strong> Great to be back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, Marcy, let’s begin with you. What is your analysis of the most recent sort of scandal, what have you, that we’re hearing now about Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Three things. I mean, one, yet again, he’s running his mouth. He is, according to the people leaking this, doing highly inappropriate things. And again, it involves Russians. Big surprise. The second thing is, frankly, maybe we’ll get to the bottom of what this laptop threat is that has DHS threatening to take our laptops away from us and putting them down under the plane, where they can search them until we get them back at baggage claim. Because it seems like another one of those threats emanating from the Middle East where we all run around going, “Ahhh!” And no one wants to talk about it. So, maybe this will lead to some illumination on that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then the third thing, the key about that story, is they’re like, “Oh my gosh, Trump told Kislyak and Lavrov what city this threat emanated from, what city it came from,” and that’s the horrible thing, because —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In ISIS-controlled territory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> In ISIS-controlled territory, and there’s only, what, like three cities left that they control? So, you know, process of elimination. But it was about sharing the city, because the ally that shared that information with us would be horrified to learn that he shared that city. And if you look at the original Washington Post story on it, they make it clear that the sources leaking to them shared the city. And then they went and made a story out of the fact that both Trump shared the city and these U.S. officials, which of course, you know, could mean anything, then shared the city with the Washington Post. And it’s like, you know, let’s go beat up Trump. I’m really happy to do that. But at the same time, let’s also be aware of the fact that the leakers behind this story did precisely what they’re accusing Trump of. And as the Washington Post makes clear: for them it’s illegal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, the New York Times is reporting that — and they’re basing this on a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information — New York Times is saying that the classified intelligence that Trump supposedly disclosed in this meeting with the Russians was intelligence provided by Israel. Is there any significance to that in your view?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> It would have been one of the obvious choices. I’m a little bit less worried that Israel’s really gonna stop sharing intelligence with the United States. I mean, come on, right? But I — it also might explain the leaks from all of these people to journalists in the United States feeling like it was cool to leak the same information, the city, whereas it wasn’t cool for Trump to leak intelligence to the Russians — that, you know, you could explain that. And there’s also the focus on, well, maybe Iran will get that. It makes a lot more sense if this is Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, for all of the kind of hooting and hollering about Trump giving classified information to the Russians, when you actually look at the details as they’re reported right now, I wouldn’t say that it’s a nothing burger, but it does seem like the reaction is disproportionate to what we understand Trump actually said or supposedly revealed to the Russians. What do you make of the timing of this leak, given that this meeting happened a day after James Comey was fired as FBI Director?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it makes it look a lot more like retaliation for the Comey firing, particularly given, what, the week between the meeting to when it was dropped on all these newspapers. And maybe that’s just explained by the fact that the IC had to go brief U.S. officials in Congress, who then ran to the press to leak it. But the other thing to explain the timing, I think, is this will make it harder to do what Trump seems intent on doing this week, which is naming an FBI director candidate before Comey actually testifies. So, it’s really hard to separate those two things. It does seem like retaliation. The response, the way in which this orchestrated six different outlets reporting the story in quick succession definitely seems like a response to the Comey firing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and if it was a hit, it’s a pretty successful hit, assisted, no doubt, by Trump’s total and complete incompetence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Yeah, he’s an idiot. I mean, there’s no question he did something inappropriate, and there is no question that he doesn’t even know what he did ‘cause he’s an idiot. He doesn’t know how to deal with this information. It doesn’t excuse that he did it. That’s part of the reason why he’s problematic. But he sort of fell into their — into their — not trap, because you don’t need a trap to capture Trump, but it just seems all neat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn, what is your initial analysis of what’s happening here? Because you were tweeting about this and looking at Trump’s tweets about Edward Snowden and saying, “when is that human piece of garbage going to be returned to the United States, and that he was leaking America’s secrets.” But your initial take on this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Right. So obviously, Trump did something reckless and impetuous, and a byproduct of his complete ignorance, and that’s obviously not a surprise to anyone. And there’s hypocrisy involved, given what you just referenced. But there are several things bothering me. Number one is that we don’t actually know what it is that he revealed, and therefore can’t really assess how serious or damaging it actually is. You could imagine plausible examples of things he might have said that were classified, but that I can’t understand why it would be so damaging, such as, we learned that ISIS in a particular city is planning on taking down planes using laptops, something that was already publicly known, even if the details of it weren’t. Secondly, it continues to really, you know, bother me, and it makes me very wary that so many of our stories are shaped by anonymous intelligence sources whose word is just taken as gold, even though no evidence is offered, even though they have all kinds of axes to grind. Story after story involves people in the intelligence community running to the Washington Post or CNN in order to disclose stories that are harmful to Trump that we don’t really know any corroboration for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then thirdly, and I think the thing bothering me most, is that we continue to accept this premise that the U.S. and Russia are intractable, overarching enemies, almost like it’s the worst part of the Cold War, when the reality is, as Obama himself continually acknowledged, the U.S. and Russia have a lot of common interests, especially in the counterterrorism realm, and especially when it comes to fighting ISIS. I mean ISIS actually probably took down a Russian plane in retaliation for Russian bombing in Syria. It makes sense that the two countries would want to cooperate when it comes to sharing intelligence about ISIS threats. So, it’s not like he’s sharing information in a realm where they actually have adverse interests or where we’re truly enemies. It seems to be a very dumb and poorly thought through decision, but one that I don’t think we have any evidence to believe is really so cataclysmic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Marcy, in the immediate aftermath of this story initially breaking in the Washington Post, and then all of these other media outlets then, you know, say that they confirmed various elements of it, particularly the core element, you had Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s statement, released by the White House, not the State Department. And then you had the national security adviser, McMaster, come out onto the lawn at the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>H.R. McMaster:\u003c/strong> The story that came out tonight as reported is false. The president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time — at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There was a lot of parsing of his words in the news coverage of this, saying, you know, he said no sources or methods were revealed, but that’s not what the reporting on this said. But in fact, McMaster said the story as reported is totally false. What’s going on there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> You know it’s not clear that revealing the city would be a source and method. Presumably, it wouldn’t, because — I didn’t realize CNN had it too. But CNN, Washington Post, and how many of the other 15 journalists who have gotten this story dumped onto their lap have been told the city, right? Somewhere between the White House version and the version of the sources all leaking this, there’s a lot of flux about whether Trump shared information that would make it obvious to the Russians what the real story is. And I think that’s a really interesting question, because we are making a great big deal out of this, and there’s enough flux in the story, right, and this whole thing — oh, it’s about the city. That’s not a source and method. Let’s name the three cities it could be, right? That’s not that hard to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn, I wanted to get your response to something that Alan Dershowitz said on CNN about this story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alan Dershowitz:\u003c/strong> This is the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president of the United States. Let’s not underestimate it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your response?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> I mean that’s nothing more than an obvious joke. You know, the — I mean, it’s possible that what Trump did here, if you use your very active imagination, could fulfill that description. If he purposely gave the names of spies inside Moscow to Russia in order for the Russians to apprehend and then kill them, that would actually be treason. But there’s zero evidence this was anything like that. No one thinks that. So, you have presidents who have launched secret wars and killed millions of people, implemented worldwide torture regimes, engaged in genocide, interred American citizens with no due process for years. The list of extreme presidential crimes goes on and on and on and on. To call this this most serious accusation ever made against a sitting president is an inherent joke, and I think the kind of hysteria that constantly is now acceptable whenever the topic is Trump and Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Marcy, you know, we also know that McMaster said the day after this story came out —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HRM:\u003c/strong> That the President wasn’t even aware, you know, of where this information came from. He wasn’t briefed on the source or method of the information either.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to sort of fly up to 30,000 feet here and ask you about the overall unfolding or unraveling of the Trump presidency. What is really going to bring all of this to a head? Because my sense is that Trump’s own conduct since he became president is far more of a threat to his presidency than anything that they’re going to uncover about him, or that we have any sense they’re going to uncover about him, related to Russia. I mean, barring some pee tape or, you know, some violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, isn’t it the case that Trump has basically created his own scandal that could lead to his downfall?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> I mean I would separate the Comey scandal from this scandal. And I would caution people that — I’d be happy to see the rear end of Trump as much as anybody, but there are many ways he can be brought down. One is the way the intelligence community would like to, which is this leak. The other one is an extreme abuse of power with the Comey firing, which, you know, I sort of regard this leak campaign as a response to that. But the other is that he’s unfit, that he has all of these compromises. His son, Jared Kushner, I think has even bigger compromises. He kept Mike Flynn when it was clear he shouldn’t be around. And so, it’s worthwhile for people to keep those different strands in mind and think very seriously about what they want to be the undoing of a president, and whether they want the IC to set the terms for that, or whether they want gross corruption to set the terms for that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It seems to me as though the Democrats and a lot of media figures have really latched onto any part of this that has the word Russia and Trump in it, and they go to town, even if there really isn’t evidence to back up the allegations. And my concern is that the actual truth is far less salacious or incendiary than the allegations. Is there any long-term consequence to the way the Trump investigations are unfolding and being talked about in the broader culture of U.S. media?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean there’s supposed to be legal and constitutional means for removing a president under certain prescribed circumstances. And I think what people are finding, is that at least as of yet, they can’t demonstrate that Trump falls within the scope of that, but nonetheless believe that he’s such a threat to Democratic institutions or the stability of the United States that anything and everything is justified in order to remove him, in order to take him down. And that’s ultimately going to become — I think a critical question is, is it more damaging to leave Trump in office, or is it more — until those constitutional or legal standards can be fulfilled? Or is it more damaging to just say, let’s have the media and the intelligence community, the Deep State, as it were, work together to just destroy him, even though he won the election, because they believe that leaving him in office is more damaging than whatever the long-term damages are for them kind of going outside the rules to remove a president who won? And I think that’s the dilemma that we face, and that’s a really serious question, no matter how much you hate Trump. And I don’t think there’s an easy answer to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Marcy, ten seconds. Does Trump finish one term as president of the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> I doubt it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The most likely way that he goes?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> I have no idea. I mean, I think he’s not having any fun either. And he is increasingly not competent to do the job, so there’s always the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment. I think the big question is how — whether his approval ratings among Republicans stand, because I think as soon as those start to fall apart, that’s when the Republicans will move.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Dr. Marcy Wheeler, thank you very much for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MW:\u003c/strong> Awesome to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn, thank you very much for joining us as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> It’s always an honor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Coming up on the show, just when you think it can’t get any crazier, you learn more about Donald Trump, the FBI, James Comey, and General Flynn. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back here on Intercepted. And I have to say; it is almost impossible to keep up with the developments in the Trump presidency. It feels like we’ve been doing this for years, when in reality, it’s been just four months. It was literally just last week, last Tuesday, that Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. And then this Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the day after General Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser, Donald Trump asked Comey to shut down the federal investigation of General Flynn. The Times said it had been read portions of a memo that Comey purportedly wrote after his conversation with Donald Trump. The president reportedly said to Comey, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Now, the White House immediately denied that report, calling it “not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, in testimony last week, in front of the U.S. Senate, the acting FBI Director, Andrew McCabe, said bluntly that there had been no attempts by the White House or Trump to impede the FBI investigation into the Russian affair. So, who is to be believed? The Comey memo, or Andrew McCabe?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Andrew McCabe:\u003c/strong> The work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstance, any decisions. So, there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date. Simply put, sir, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people, and upholding the Constitution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, perhaps this is the beginning of the revenge of Comey and his allies. Maybe this is being leaked in retaliation to Trump’s firing of James Comey. Or maybe it’s being leaked because there are people within the FBI that believe that the story of alleged interference in this investigation has not been told, and that it must be told. We don’t know. The Democrats certainly want James Comey to testify before the U.S. Congress. But lost in all of this discussion about Trump firing James Comey and whose side Comey is on are the deeper questions about the FBI’s actual role in our society. This situation with Comey and Trump has created its own series of contradictions. The Democrats, or I should say many Democrats, who once called for Comey’s firing after his intervention in the presidential election was perceived as a hit against Hillary Clinton, they are now angrily denouncing Comey’s removal by Trump. And every new detail that comes out, including this report that Trump had tried to get Comey to back off of the General Flynn investigation, it is welcome fuel to dump onto the Trump fire. And that is, in many ways, predictable Washington partisan business, it makes sense that the Democrats would be doing this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what I find disturbing is this emerging — and it’s been fast emerging — characterization of Jim Comey as this great independent protector of the republic, and the idea that the FBI is an independent actor that always has the nation’s best interests at heart. The FBI is not a political entity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To dig into all of this, I’m joined by two people. Tim Weiner is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. He was a long-time correspondent for the New York Times. He is the author of several books, including “Enemies: A History of the FBI,” and “Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA.” He also wrote a book about Richard Nixon. And I’m joined by Trevor Aaronson. He covers the FBI for The Intercept. He’s also the executive director of the nonprofit Florida Center for Investigative Reporting. Trevor has done a tremendous amount of work on FBI entrapment of Muslims in the United States, and he’s the author of ‘The Terror Factory: Inside the FBI’s Manufactured War on Terrorism.” Tim, Trevor, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tim Weiner:\u003c/strong> Hi, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Trevor Aaronson:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Part of the narrative that we’re hearing from opponents of the Trump administration, and particularly from Democrats and liberal pundits, is that James Comey is an independent-minded figure who would have conducted a fair and reasoned investigation into the Russian affair, so to speak, and that Trump canned him because he was continuing on with that investigation. What’s your analysis of this? Is that true, etc.?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> For the president to fire the director of the FBI when the FBI is investigating the president and the White House is obstruction of justice. And Trump confirmed it. The tape that could bring him down is an NBC news videotape. It’s not some secret recording in a suitcase.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lester Holt:\u003c/strong> Did you ask for a recommendation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> What I did is, I was going to fire Comey. My decision. It was not —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> You had made the decision before they came in the room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I — I was going to fire Comey. There’s no good time to do it, by the way. They —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> Because in your letter, you said, I, I accepted their recommendation, so you had already made the decision.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Oh, I was gonna fire regardless of recommendation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> Trump committed what someday may be construed as an obstruction of justice and an impeachable offense in a court of law or in Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And it seems to me that we don’t have any direct evidence linking Trump to Vladimir Putin or the Russians. There is a tremendous amount of evidence suggesting that some of his underlings on the campaign, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, then it gets to a different level when we’re talking about General Flynn. And my sense is, even if there is nothing that would directly link Trump — there very well may be — the way he has handled this could be more important to his future or lack of a future as president of the United States than any potential details of an investigation into Trump and Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> What he did is extraordinary. He basically said, “Yeah, I fired the son of a bitch because he was investigating me. This Trump Russia story’s a hoax.” It’s not a hoax. It is the biggest and most politically charged counterintelligence investigation the FBI has done since the Soviets stole the secrets of the atomic bomb. And what Trump did, I think, will only redouble the efforts of the FBI to get to the bottom of this case, wherever it may lead. And if it leads up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they will be knocking on the door and serving subpoenas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trevor Aaronson, you’ve covered the FBI under Comey, and I think sometimes this gets lost in the mix of the discussion because Trump is so over the top in how he responds to even the slightest chiseling at his ego. What has been the legacy of James Comey from your perspective, Trevor, and the issues that you cover?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> Well, I think one of the things that Comey has done that started under his predecessor, Bob Mueller, is really have an aggressive counterterrorism approach that uses informants and undercover agents. And what we’ve seen is that instead of stopping attacks before they occur, such as the Orlando shooting involving Omar Mateen at the nightclub, or the San Bernardino shooting, they end up finding people who are easy to catch because they’re vulnerable or they’re mentally ill, or they’re people that an undercover agent or informant can lure into a terrorism plot. And so, what we’ve seen under Comey is dozens and dozens of people, most of whom have no connections to international terrorist groups, getting involved in plots that the government alleges are terrorist plots, and then prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Comey has also gone to tremendous extents to investigate people while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of what the FBI normally would do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>An example of that is the FBI busted a dark web child porn website, and instead of immediately shutting it down, as was the previous policy, you know, they kept it open for two weeks so that they could surreptitiously install tracking devices on people who used the website, while at the same time, you know, making child pornography available through FBI servers while they were doing it. And then, of course, another example is that the FBI has gone as far, recently, as impersonating journalists to get close to criminal suspects, as we saw in the fake documentary that was used to investigate Cliven Bundy, the rancher who had an arms stand in Nevada.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ryan Bundy:\u003c/strong> You have had the questions asked, is this just a mole project to garner information that will then be given to the Feds or whomever, whatever for incriminating purposes? Is this an interview and a documentary, or is this an interrogation? That was basically our question and consent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FBI Agent:\u003c/strong> I understand that. And the only thing that I ask from you, very simple. I’ll ask you a question. I ask you to tell me the truth. ‘Cause I, I want a truthful documentary. ‘Cause that’s what I’ve said. I want to put the truth out there. I can’t make that up because you know what? I wasn’t there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FBI:\u003c/strong> All righty. Let’s proceed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Tim Weiner, is any of this relevant in your view? I mean, you’ve written a very in-depth book about the history of the FBI. I saw you sort of shaking your head. Are you of the mindset that Comey’s record on some of these issues is totally irrelevant to discussing his departure by way of being fired by Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> It is now, ‘cause he’s the ex-director of the FBI because the President of the United States fired him. I mean does the FBI run sting operations that are morally abhorrent? Yeah, they’ve been doing it since the 1930s. Does the FBI entrap people? You know, break the law in the name of the law? Yeah, they’ve been doing that, you know, since the Red Scare in the ’20s. It’s very hard to run a secret intelligence service, and the FBI is a secret intelligence service as well as a law enforcement agency. It is very hard to run a secret intelligence service in an open democratic society. You’re always going to have conflict, a tug-of-war between the power of secrecy and the openness of democracy. And what we are seeing now is an epic struggle in which it’s going to appall a lot of your audience. But the FBI’s on the right side here. Mike Hayden, who used to run the CIA and the NSA, not your — you know, the number one member of your fan club or mine, just said what the President did makes the United States look like Nicaragua under the Samosa dictatorships. And Jim Clapper, not your number one fan either or mine, the former director of National Intelligence, just said that what Trump has done is pounding at the foundations of American democracy. So, we’re living in Trump world now. And the old alliances are being realigned, okay? Where people who love democracy and cherish an open society are finding themselves on the same page as some of the, you know, members of the national security state in the 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup> century.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, to just push back a little bit on that, the issues that Trevor is raising are in fact very real.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> Absolutely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And my — no, and I know — I know you’re not disputing that. My issue with this in part, and we saw this at the very beginning when Trump went to the CIA, you know, and had compared the CIA —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> He called them Nazis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. To, to Nazis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake — out. I think it’s a disgrace. And I say that — and I say that. And that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it’s a disgrace.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One trend that I’ve seen that I think could potentially be very dangerous, though — I think a lot of Democrats — and if you watch, you know, some of the more liberal news commentators, because of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” mentality, there seems to be this really fast flipping into “the FBI is on our side.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> Is your best friend, right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The FBI’s your best friend. And that’s why, you know — Trevor, I want you to respond to what Tim was saying, but also, I do disagree a bit with Tim on this, because I, and I don’t think is Tim’s perspective, but I think a lot of people are now, “oh, FBI versus Trump? FBI: good.” And I think that’s a problematic analysis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I definitely think there has been this lionization of James Comey as a result of this, in part because I think people are searching for some sort of check on Trump’s power, and Congress is showing very little willingness to be that check. And at the same time, in telling these stories, I think it’s sometimes easy to sink to archetypes and want to show Comey or whoever it might be as the loyal man to the republic who is standing up to protect it against the forces within that are trying to destroy it. That’s an oversimplication of what’s happening here. And it’s too easy to say, okay, yes, the FBI is the force of good because they’re the ones investigating Trump. And by saying that, I think you’re also forgetting that, as Tim knows, there’s a very long history of the FBI not being on the right side of justice and not being on the right side of history. You know, certainly, it’s a worthy investigation and should be pursued by the FBI and Congressional committees. But that doesn’t mean that, you know, the FBI is the faultless organization that was here to protect us if not for Trump removing the director here. And I think that’s something we need to be careful about in telling this story, because I think the history of the FBI and the story of the FBI now is not that simple. But when you hear people talk about it today, and then the outrage of firing James Comey, I think no one is really talking about some of the abuses of power that we saw under James Comey.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As one example, I would say, you know, one of the things that Trump has said is that the story is not Russia. It’s not Russia. It’s really about surveillance. And what he means is his wiretap or supposed wiretap by Barack Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> You saw what happened with surveillance, and I think that was inappropriate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Dickerson:\u003c/strong> What does that mean, sir?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> You can figure that out yourself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Well, the return I ask is you said he was — you called him sick and bad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Look, you can figure it out yourself. He was very nice to me with words, but — and when I was with him, but after that, there has been no relationship.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> But in some ways, even though he doesn’t mean this exactly, the story is about surveillance. I mean, one of the things that we saw under James Comey is a clear expansion of powers to investigate people even when there was no reason to believe they were at all involved in crime. You know, through the current assessment process, you know, the FBI needs very little authority from above within the FBI to investigate just about anybody: you, me, one of your listeners. You know, no reason to believe that they are involved in crime. You know, just having, for example, a belief that that person would be a good informant gives the FBI unprecedented power to investigate people for 72 hours. And so, what’s interesting is Trump is saying the story’s not me, it’s not me, it’s surveillance. And in some ways, that’s true. That’s also a story. And I think it’s something we shouldn’t forget in trying to boil down the story of Trump versus the FBI or FBI versus Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Tim Weiner?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> There is no question that the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover was a malevolent force in this society. And Hoover ran it for 48 years, from 1924 to 1972. But there’s also no question, we’re living in bizarro world, folks. We’re living in Trumpland now. And you have to be able to hold two opposing ideas in your head at the same time in order to stay sane. And we have to remember that it was the FBI that took down Richard Nixon, with all due respect to Woodward and Bernstein. It was the FBI that investigated Ronald Reagan’s national security team. Whether we like it or not, the FBI is the only force we’ve got that can investigate the president of the United States and serve subpoenas at the White House, and take down a president if that president is corrupt, okay? Congress can impeach, but they’re gonna be working off evidence gathered by the FBI. It’s not gonna be handed over to them by, you know, couriers from the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, but absent from your history here, and I know you’ve written an excellent history book on the FBI, is — I could also say, well, it was the FBI that was running COINTELPRO, and was —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> COINTELPRO, sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And was infiltrating antiwar groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> It did all of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And more recently was engaging in entrapment under James Comey. I mean, you said we have to be able to think of two minds. You just presented one part of it, which is the force for good has been in its history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> Right. And we all know the other half. There’s always gonna be a tug of war in this country between secrecy and democracy, between the abuse of power and the use of power to promote a free and democratic society. And I think Jim Comey is not the second coming of J. Edgar Hoover. I think that Jim Comey is a fairly upright guy, and I think that given who Trump is probably going to install as the head of the FBI, we are going to miss him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trevor, on that note, I mean, one of the great concerns, and I think this is what Tim is alluding to, if Trump does put someone in place at the FBI who is much more of a Trump loyalist or a rabid partisan, or is wholly unqualified to be in that position, you could have the kind of relationship to intelligence and blackmailing, etc., that we saw under J. Edgar Hoover.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> I wouldn’t call Comey’s FBI a malevolent force, right? I think it’s far more complicated than that. But I would say that it’s an agency that has been both a force for good and a force for bad — for evil, in a sense. And what I would say is an example of that is that we live in this time where I think part of Trump’s political platform has been able to establish by a growing sense of Islamophobia and a fear that terrorism threats are more than they currently are, particularly from Muslims in the United States and abroad. Part of the reason that people believe this is the case is that you see a very aggressive FBI over the last decade, including the four years that Comey was director, pursuing terrorism cases that almost exclusively involved Muslims, and involved Muslims who did not have the capacity on their own to get involved in terrorism. But because an FBI informant or an undercover agent made that possible, we see hundreds and hundreds of prosecutions of terrorism-related cases in federal court. And when those busts are made, they make the front page of the newspaper. They make cable news. And it exaggerates the feeling that terrorism, while real, is this imminent threat that could happen to anyone, anywhere, and would most likely be perpetrated by a Muslim in the United States. As well meaning as that policy in trying to prevent the next attack has been, it has created a perception of Muslims as a threat that I think Trump and a lot of the Republicans have been able to capitalize on. And so, while not malevolent in intention, it ended up being kind of malevolent in the end in that way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> There is no question that the FBI has used and always has used methods of entrapment, okay? That can pass muster in a court of law. That is using plants, using people posing as terrorists or criminals, or communists, if you want to go back to the Cold War, to entrap and ensnare people into committing crimes. There is no question about that. What we are talking about here is a different order of magnitude. People need to understand that. The FBI is going up against the president of the United States, who does not believe in democracy, who does not believe in the rule of law, who has never read the Constitution that Khizr Khan was trying to wave in his face last year. And if he gets some hack, some political stooge, in charge of the FBI, we are in for a world of pain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What if he did put someone in who was more of a political appointee, meaning on the same page as Trump politically, whatever that means. What could you see happening worse than we’ve seen in the post J. Edgar Hoover era?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> Well, one thing I’ve learned over my 30-odd years as a journalist is to never say things can’t get any worse, because they can. First of all, no director of the FBI since Hoover died six weeks before the Watergate break in 1972 has been a political appointee, has been someone who has been appointed or nominated because he’s a political person, okay? There have been judges. There have been former FBI agents. There have been people of high moral character and not so high moral character. But there has never been someone who was nominated because he’s a congressman or senator.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trevor, I mean, I know you’re not so much covering the broader politics of the firing of James Comey, but as someone who has done a lot of investigating of specific FBI actions, I’m curious what your reaction was when you read Trump’s very brief letter firing James Comey that apparently was not even given to Comey before Jim Comey saw on the news and thought that it was a joke that was being played on him that he had been removed. And specifically the line, you know, that I think a lot of people are focusing on, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau.” What was your response when you saw that news?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> It was extraordinary. It was — to use what Tim said, it was kind of feeling like living in bizarro world, right? Like, this seemed to me an obvious attempt by Trump to put something in the document that he could later point back to and say, “Look, see? I’m not under investigation. It was in my letter, you know, firing Comey.” You know, certainly, as has been reported and is widely known, it is not the FBI policy to confirm or deny someone being under investigation, absent them receiving a specific target letter. And so, it would have been extraordinarily hard to believe, or is extraordinarily hard to believe that James Comey sitting at dinner with Trump, as he claimed during the NBC interview, or talking to him on the phone, would have said, you know, “Yes, sir, Mr. President, you’re not under investigation.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I said, “If it’s possible, would you let me know, am I under investigation?” He said, “You are not under investigation.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> I mean, it was just an obvious lie, and it certainly wasn’t the president’s first obvious lie. What the Trump administration has done is proven itself kind of highly incompetent. And if your goal is to replace the FBI director while keeping a certain amount of productivity in the FBI and morale in the FBI — I mean, the way he did it, in such a disrespectful manner — I mean, with FBI agents I’ve talked to, both current and former, I mean, their biggest complaint is the disrespectful way in which he fired him, right? I mean, it was kind of fitting in some ways that Comey, who was known as this guy who would get around and talk to agents perhaps more than previous directors had done, was talking to agents in LA when this all happened, and in such a thuggish way that the letter from Trump was delivered by his bodyguard. I mean, I think that’s something that’s going to stick with FBI agents who might not even be particularly loyal to Comey for a long, long time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we wrap up here, what is the legacy of James Comey in your view?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> I think the most troubling legacy for James Comey is that he’s really expanded the human intelligence apparatus that the FBI has. I mean they have an unprecedented number of informants. They use off the books informants known as hip pockets who aren’t necessarily registered, but are providing information to the FBI. And I think one of the things that Americans should realize is that, you know, the FBI, as Tim describes, has always been this force that has been surveilling Americans and looking into Americans’ private lives, but through technology now and through an unprecedented army of informants, you know, the FBI has very extraordinary powers. And this was something that was not curbed under Comey, and in fact has expanded even further. And I would expect these powers and these surveillance tools to increase under, you know, whoever it is that Trump’s appointed as the FBI director.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> Jim Comey is gonna come forward at some point, sooner rather than later, and address Congress, and talk to the people of the United States to the extent he can about what just happened here, okay? And I think it will be the hottest ticket since John Dean went before the Senate Watergate Committee in the summer of 1973.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Dean:\u003c/strong> The Watergate matter was an inevitable outgrowth of a climate of excessive concern over the political impact of demonstrators, excessive concern over leaks, and insatiable appetite for political intelligence, all coupled with a do it yourself White House staff, regardless of the law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> I think that we are at the beginning of a very long process that may take months and years to get the bottom of this case. And whoever Trump comes up with, and whoever the Senate confirms as FBI director will not hold a candle to Jim Comey in terms of his, I would say forthrightness. I would say honesty. The power of the FBI, the power of the prosecutor, the power to subpoena people, the power to haul them before a grand jury, is an awesome power. It is a terrifying power. No other agency in the United States has that kind of power. And if that power is put in the hands of an attorney general like Sessions and a political operative selected by Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate, we are in a — we’re going to be in a world of pain like we have not experienced since Richard Nixon tried to run this country off a cliff more than 40 years ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m gonna give you five scenarios, and I want you to tell me what you think are the most likely. But I’m gonna give you these five scenarios in the order that I think is most likely, all right? How does Donald Trump end being President of the United States? Number one, I believe, he just quits. He decides, I don’t want to do this, gives a speech where he says, you know, you guys have all misunderstood me, and he wants to go back to hosting The Apprentice. Number two, dies of a heart attack. The guy’s gaining weight like crazy. He’s eating KFC and Big Macs, etc. Number three, removal under the 25\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> Amendment, that they’re gonna say, this guy is completely incapable of holding office. Number four, impeachment, and number five — and I don’t even think this is that realistic, but I’m putting it in there for the crowd — finishes an actual term as President of the United States. Tim, go ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> One term?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One term.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> I think he stumbles through until the November 2018 elections. I think if the people of the United States get off their rear ends and vote — and I don’t care if they vote for, you know, a redheaded dog — for someone who’s not a Trump stooge, and they flip the Congress, they flip the House, and they flip the Senate, Trump is impeached.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trevor, what’s the most likely way that Trump stops being president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TA:\u003c/strong> You know, if I had to guess, I would say it would be coming up on the midterm elections, like seeing really terrible poll numbers, and knowing that if they flip the Congress, he’s likely impeached, he’ll quit in spectacular fashion, and — rather than be blamed for the loss in Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Well, we’ll have you both back on to see that I was right, and that he quits or he dies of a heart attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TW:\u003c/strong> What do we win?

And his first stop is Saudi Arabia. He is then going to go to Israel before heading on to Rome, where he’s going to meet with Pope Francis. This is how National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster spun the significance of Trump’s itinerary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HRM:\u003c/strong> Well, he’s going to the Western Wall mainly in connection with the theme to connect with three of the world’s great religions, and to advance — to pay homage at each of these religious sites that he’s visiting, but also to highlight the theme that we all have to be united against what are really the enemies of all civilized people, and that we have to be joined together with an agenda of tolerance of tolerance and moderation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. I’m joined now on the phone by Rula Jebreal. She’s a Palestinian author, journalist, and foreign policy analyst, and she’s currently a visiting professor at the American University in Rome. Rula, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rula Jebreal:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, Rula, we know that on Donald Trump’s first international trip, stop number one is Saudi Arabia. What do you make of the significance of Trump starting off his international presidency traveling by going to Saudi Arabia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> It’s a disaster. But it’s in concert with who the man is. He’s traveling to an abusive country that is, in this moment as we speak, is bombing women, children, families in Yemen, a country that gifted us al Qaeda and every radical group. 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis. Women are still banned from every — you know, from appearing in public with their — without covering their face and all of their body. They cannot vote. They cannot drive. And even the guy that’s considered a reformist, Al Hamad Bin Salman, the crown prince, is a guy that a year ago said, “Well, we’re not ready to have equal women rights.” I mean it’s preposterous. It’s ridiculous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And of course, ahead of that trip, Trump was meeting with officials in Washington of the United Arab Emirates.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Yeah. That’s another country that is pushing a certain agenda in the region. And the agenda is clear: security above all. This is a country that support and finance Sisi in Egypt, a dictator that put in jail 40,000 prisoners, and is using special laws to go after every opposition leader, every critic, every journalist. They want to go on as if the Arab Spring never happened, as if people don’t still demand — they don’t want freedom or democracy, dignity, or a better life. It’s not a coincidence that in his travel ban, the first executive order, these two countries were not on the list. Donald Trump is happy to travel to Saudi Arabia and kiss the ring of the king in order to get the money of out them. So basically, we’re bending American foreign policy towards the checkbooks of these thugs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And of course, Trump is not only going to Saudi Arabia, he is then going on to Jerusalem and then to Rome. And the way that he sort of presented it, you know, all neatly tied up with a bow, is that he’s going to the birthplaces of the world’s three major religions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Well, you know, yeah. I mean, the hypocrisy of this approach. We ban Muslims from entering the U.S., but then let’s go and visit what suddenly they call itself the leader of the Muslim world. And basically, the only countries that embraced the Muslim ban were the Emirates and Saudi Arabia. So, that tells you everything you need to know. They don’t care about Muslims. They never did. And when it comes to Israel, it’s the most effective form of lobbying, where basically, I think Washington works for Israel. It’s not the other way around. Donald Trump is going to Israel not because of religious reasons, but because it’s good for the appearances. It looks good to distract people from what he’s doing at home. He wants to visit Israel because he promised Bibi that he will visit him. But these are the people that he, you know — he can see himself with. When Donald Trump talked about Mexicans being rapists, this is what Bibi Netanyahu said publicly when he talked about the democratic threat about people who were born with different ethnic backgrounds that basically are a threat to democracy. Both of them, Donald Trump, this is a shared value. And coming here to Rome, it’s a deflection. He criticized the pope himself. You know, this pope has been the most progressive pope, who spoke kindly about immigrants, refugees, and who spoke kindly even about homosexuality. Donald Trump attacked him. Let’s remember that. That’s the same Donald Trump that now wants to meet with the pope. It’s a joke.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> So, the Mexican government fed the pope a tremendous amount of stuff about “Trump is not a good person,” and the pope just made a statement — I mean, can you imagine? I just got a call. As I’m walking up here, they said, “Mr. Trump, the Pope made a statement about you.” I said, “The Pope?” [Crowd laughs] “What did the Pope say? I like the Pope. I mean, was it good or bad? Because if it’s good, I like the Pope. If it’s bad, I don’t like the Pope.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is your analysis of Trump’s approach, as far as we can see it, to Palestine an Israel?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> You know, the idea that only Trump can do things in the Middle East, we are used to these strong guys, these tyrants who tell us, “Only I can achieve this.” I heard this in my lifetime. Qaddafi said that multiple times. Saddam Hussein. So, this kind of rhetoric is normal somehow in the Middle East. However, the idea that only Donald Trump can achieve something and can get something out of the Israelis — I mean, Kushner himself never met, I think, a Palestinian until last week.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> He is so great. If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can. Okay? All my life, I’ve been hearing, that’s the toughest deal in the world to make. And I’ve seen it. But I have a feeling that Jared is gonna do a great job. I have a feeling he’s gonna do a great job.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> They want to move the embassy to Israel, financed by Sheldon Adelson, who paid five million dollars to be seated next to the president during the inauguration. These are only big sentences, big words. Look, I lived in Italy for too long not to remember Berlusconi, who used to make these grand announcements, big announcements, and nothing would follow. So, I don’t think anybody in the Middle East, especially Palestinians or Israelis, thinks that Donald Trump will achieve anything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> So, I’m looking at two state and one state, and I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like. I could live with either one. I thought for a while the two state looked like it may be the easier of the two, but honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> But we know that it’s a one state reality already. And our struggle as Palestinians and the struggle of the Israeli left, if there is any, is equal rights. It’s a one country, one state, and if it’s really a democracy and not an ethnocracy, then we all have the right to vote, otherwise it’s an apartheid state, and what we are endorsing and sponsoring and enabling in Israel is an apartheid state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump made this statement —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can’t let this continue. We can’t let this happen any longer. You — [Crowd claps] We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. [Crowd cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If that does come to fruition, and you have the U.S. set up shop in Jerusalem and really promote this as an overt embrace of the most radical rightwing components of Zionism, what does that represent, and what will happen as a result of that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> I am from Jerusalem. My father worked in the Aqsa Mosque for almost three decades. The Muslim world will erupt. They will never accept that the third holiest place for Islam is totally dominated by the most extreme rightwing version of the Jewish community. So, if we — if a man can move the embassy, one billion point six hundred million Muslims will view this as basically, this is an aggression. You want to take away from us their sacred place. If you ask any Muslim individual, and you ask them, “What do you feel about Jerusalem?” first they think they tell you that they feel that Jerusalem was — it’s under occupation. And they feel if you touch the mosque, you’re basically touching them. They’re touching something that’s very dear to them. And I am sure that this will be viewed as a war, a declaration of war on the Muslim world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Rula Jebreal, we gotta leave it there.

And he fit in just perfectly. This week on Intercepted: Professor As’ad Abukhalil dissects Trump’s summit in Saudi Arabia, the ongoing massacre in Yemen, and the plight of the Palestinians. ISIS has taken credit for the terror attack in Manchester, but what role do Trump’s friends in the Middle East play in fueling such horrors? The Intercept’s new D.C. Bureau Chief Ryan Grim and national security reporter Matthew Cole discuss Gen. Michael Flynn, Erik Prince, and whether anyone in the Trump administration realizes how insane their boss actually is.

Trump stood there next to the Saudi king, who believes that beheading people is an appropriate punishment for a nation state to administer in the year 2017. Trump stood there with General Abdel Fattah el Sisi, the dictator of Egypt. And by the way, Trump loved Sisi’s shoes. Talked all about it. Trump stood at the center of a sea filled with some of the most reprehensible despots on the planet. Saudi Arabia was Trump’s first destination on his very first international trip as the commander in chief of the United States. And Trump felt right at home.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I stand before you as a representative of the American people to deliver a message of friendship and hope and love. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At the beginning of his time in Saudi Arabia, Trump read a speech that we understand was largely prepared by his little Islamophobic minion, Stephen Miller. And Trump was absolutely jubilant over the deal that he signed with the Saudis to buy $110 billion-dollars’ worth of weapons from the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion-dollar Saudi-funded defense purchase. And we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> With no sense of irony or the obvious contradictions, Trump joined the Saudi king, King Salman, for the grand opening of the Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology. Trump, at that ceremony — in fact, not on his entire trip in Saudi Arabia — Trump did not mention the Saudi connection to the 9/11 attacks, nor did he mention the Saudi campaign to support radical extremism across the globe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Later today, we will make history again with the opening of the new Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology, located right here in this central part of the Islamic world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, as has happened any time Trump reads a speech without, like, spitting out whatever thoughts pop into his head, Trump was again praised in the media by some for what they described as his softer tone, or his presidential demeanor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bob Schieffer:\u003c/strong> Today, you saw a very different President Trump. He actually sounded presidential. You may agree or disagree with what he said, but he sounded like a president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump was a great hit in Saudi Arabia. He heaped praise on the brutal scorched earth massacre in Yemen that the U.S. and the Saudis are waging jointly. Iran, which just held a democratic election, was portrayed by Trump and his despotic allies as the one true dictatorship in the region. After flying from Saudi Arabia to Tel Aviv, it didn’t take long for the buffoonery to kick back into high gear. On the tarmac when they got off the plane, Melania Trump was caught on camera batting away Donald’s outstretched hand. Trump then proceeded, with cameras rolling, to make clear that he didn’t really know that Israel and Palestine are in the Middle East. And that happened to some of the visible embarrassment of some of the officials gathered in the room with Trump and his buddy Bibi Netanyahu. Trump was like a kid caught in mom’s wallet when he promised Bibi that he never mentioned Israel to the Russians in the Oval Office. “I promise, Bibi, it didn’t happen.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Trump returns to the U.S., he will return to the reality that the fired FBI Director James Comey, is apparently preparing to speak publicly in front of the U.S. Congress. Trump is going to return to a Republican Party that is nervous at how Trump’s antics and the scandals are gonna impact their electoral future. And Trump is going to return to record low approval ratings. Later in the show, we’re gonna dig into the latest developments with Trump and General Flynn taking the Fifth, and various investigations underway. But first, I’m joined by Professor As’ad AbuKhalil. He is Professor of Political Science at California State University at Stanislaus, and he’s also the force behind the Angry Arab News Service blog. As’ad, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>As’ad AbuKhalil:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let’s begin with the evolving story coming out in the U.K., which is, as we understand it right now, that ISIS has claimed responsibility. I’m not gonna ask you about the kind of particular of, you know, who did this and why they did it. I wanted to ask you, in a broader sense, your analysis of what happens every time we hear about one of these attacks in a Western country, whether it’s the U.K., Germany, France, or the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Several observations about that. The first one is, I heard the claim of responsibility, and what struck me is that those who were talking in Arabic couldn’t even say the word “Allahu Akbar” correctly. That struck me as an example of the kind of petty criminals in Western capitals who get drawn into this kooky idea of ISIS and so on, and then get involved in these terrorists’ dastardly attacks. The other segment of it is that this is yet another example of the fallacies of Western policies in the Middle East. On the one hand, they make these grandiose statements about the need to confront the terrorist attacks of ISIS and al Qaeda and the rest. And yet on the other hand, they are the ones who are arming to the teeth the kind of governments and tyrannies who gave rise not only to these movements, but inspired them ideologically. I mean the irony of establishing a center for confronting terrorism in Riyadh is very much like having a center to combat anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany. And of course, Western policies have tried that before — declaration of policies and dissenters, dialogue between religions, combatting extremists. And yet, Western policies are pinning their hope to combat extremism on the very extremist fanatical government that gave rise to al Qaeda and ISIS. I mean, we are unfortunately witnessing the repercussions of U.S. and Western policies in the Gulf as well as in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What about this first international trip that Donald Trump took and his decision for stop number one to be the kingdom of Saudi Arabia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> On the surface, it was quite a spectacle, you know, to have the Trump of Arabia going in there, engaging in these theatrics with Gulf tyrants. And of course, he assigned them the significant task of combatting fanaticism and extremism. But aside from the spectacle and the theatrics, you have to realize there’s gonna be failed expectations on both sides. What Trump wants is basically to transfer the cash reserves of Gulf regimes, especially Saudi Arabia, something to the tune of 500 billion dollars, to the United States. And of course, they made all these pledges, not only to buy tens of billions of dollars of weapons over the next ten years, but also to invest in the infrastructure of the United States. But that’s not gonna happen for many reasons. One, it is based on an unpredictable price of oil, which it fluctuates. The Saudis won’t be able to fulfill their promises. And second, the Saudis are notorious for making financial commitments that they never fulfill. And thirdly, how are they going to reconcile the exorbitant expenditure on arms and U.S. pleasure, and at the same time, keeping their population content to the minimum level that would prevent an uprising or mutiny by the people who are living under the most austere and severe political conditions imaginable?\u003cbr />\nOn the other hand, the Saudis also wants the United States to do for them things that the United States won’t be able to do. I mean, they want the United States to basically overthrow the Iranian regime, overthrow the Yemeni regime, overthrow the Syrian regime, and deliver for them peace and normalization with Israel by fulfilling the very minimum demands of the Palestinian collaborationist authority, something the Israeli government is not willing to do. But this, Jeremy, is not the first time we’ve seen that. In the beginning of every U.S. administration, the Gulf regimes are excited and euphoric, expecting that they will deliver the moon for them. And by the end of the administration, they always wind up disappointed for not delivering what they want them to deliver.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The fact is that in visiting Saudi Arabia, Trump was very much among his people, despots, strongmen, dictators — you had that bizarre scene where they were all touching that glowing orb. What the hell was that about, by the way?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Well, I thought it was some pagan rituals, the secrets of which we still do not know. But whatever it was, it was an indication of the absurdity of the theatrics. I mean, this was the inauguration of the Center for the Combat of Extremism. We have basically assigned the Saudi Wahhabi regime the important mission of delivering moderation to the Islamic world. And of course, we have discovered that aside from the rhetoric of Trump and his company throughout the campaign, his association with famous, bigoted, anti-Islam advocates on the ultra right, they have a problem with Islam, but they have no problem with the most extremist, fanatical, anti-Semitic, misogynistic schism within Islam, and that’s Wahhabi. So, they are at peace with Wahhabi and at war with Islam. That’s Trump’s policies towards the Islamic world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and of course, you had Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Wilbur Ross:\u003c/strong> There was not a single hint of a protestor anywhere there during the whole time we were there. Not one guy with a bad placard.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Clearly, Wilbur Ross doesn’t understand that that country is on full-blown lockdown all the time when it comes to freedom of expression. How do we know what actually is happening on any given day in Saudi Arabia? Because there really is no independent reporting from inside the country. It’s really like the old Iron Curtain countries like, you know, Enver Hoxha or Ceau?escu where, like, the world doesn’t actually know what’s happening inside of Saudi Arabia. Is that your sense?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> You’re absolutely right. But we know what’s happening by the record of imprisonment and beheading by the regime. There are many brave Saudis, men and women who oppose the regime. We also know from direct contact, not only with Saudis who live abroad, many of whom are active against the government and on behalf of Palestine, but also, Saudis, especially young Saudis, are extremely technically savvy. And some of them, you’ll be surprised, read The Intercept. For that reason, they have been following the recommendation of The Intercept about using for their communication the Signal application for the phone to avoid the interferences and the surveillance by the government. And from these communication — I get them daily, for example — we get direct, firsthand reportage that many of the people who write for the Washington Post, the New York Times, they don’t want to report what is contrary to the dominant Western narrative about what’s happening. But let us not make any mistake about that. The way the liberal media has been claiming, the policies of endorsing and sponsoring and arming tyrants is a longstanding American policy. I mean it is not that Obama used to hector and lecture Gulf tyrants about human rights. He never did. These tyrants have been sponsored and coddled by successive Western governments, from the socialist government of France to Jimmy Carter, the human rights president, all the way to Obama, and now Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Of course, you know, Trump goes to Saudi Arabia, and in his normal buffoonish way, is praising this $100 billion-dollar weapons deal with Saudi Arabia that of course his son-in-law Jared Kushner was involved with, like it’s an episode of, you know, The Gulf Apprentice. But at the same time, you have defense stocks just skyrocketing to record highs as a result of this weapons deal that was announced between Trump’s company, the United States, and the Saudi monarchy’s company, Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Well, you will witness, I think sometime in the future, near future, the stock prices going down steeply at the first sign of instability in the region, or at the first sign of a drop in the price of oil. Look, I mean, the country of Lebanon all too well knows the record of failed promises of the Saudi royal family. Five years ago, they promised to support the Lebanese Army to the tune of three billion dollars. To this day, not a penny has arrived, and they later cancelled it. You may say, “But they won’t do that to the American.” Well, if it’s in their interest not to deliver, they won’t. And they have done that in the past. I mean, do you know how many billions have been pledged by the Saudi royal family and other Gulf tyrants to the people of Afghanistan, to the people of Syria? All in conferences using the name of the friends of Afghanistan, the friends of Syria, and so on. And now we have a deputy crown prince who is as reckless as we’ve ever seen, and he may be the guy we can hope will deliver the overthrow of the regime sometime in the future, hopefully.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to remind people that as we speak, the poorest country in the Arab world, Yemen, is being mercilessly and totally destroyed right now by the Saudis with the backing, arming, logistical, intelligence support of the United States. And at the same time, we now learn that Trump authorized yet another ground raid in Yemen that they claim killed seven or so members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And of course, the United States at times is killing the same people that al Qaeda wants killed, and at other times, they’re fighting on the side of the Iranians in certain places in Iraq. And the whole thing is a huge mess. But I wanted to ask you, what do you believe is behind the Saudi and American destruction of Yemen?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> The United States is far more opposed throughout the Middle East to the enemies of al Qaeda and ISIS than they are to al Qaeda and ISIS themselves. We find that the United States and its cronies throughout the region basically delivering strikes against the enemies of these terrorist groups. And I also want to point out on the situation in Yemen, Saudi Arabia never in its long history allowed Yemen to be even mildly independent. They always wanted to dominate it and control it. And people should realize, Saudi Arabia does not want any deviation from its total hegemonic oppressive tyranny throughout Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to transition to Trump then moving on to Israel, where he very swiftly made a fool of himself, saying that he had just left the Middle East when he flew from Saudi Arabia to Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> — Done an incredible job. We just got back from the Middle East. We just got back from Saudi Arabia, and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It seems to me that the Israelis are playing Trump pretty masterfully here, with great support from the people Trump has put in charge of his Israel policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Right. But also, we have to bear in mind that Trump has proven that despite his campaign rhetoric, he is very aware that he is at the head of an empire. When Trump was elected, many of students in the international relations class were asking about what direction foreign policy will take under Trump. And I’ve always emphasized to them, which is that when you’re speaking about an empire, the ability of one man, be him Trump or Obama or anybody else, to make changes in the foreign policy direction of that empire is extremely small. They can only make stylistic changes here and there. For that reason, he reversed many of the campaign promises he made. He said he would scrap the Iran nuclear deal. He didn’t. He said he was gonna move the embassy. He changed his mind. He didn’t speak about settlements. Later he said that he is opposed to settlement. For that reason, I don’t think we can expect much changes from Bush, to Obama, to Trump. The only thing we can perhaps expect is intensification of war, which is something that Obama has done. And this one will continue as well. As for the Arab-Israeli conflict, I mean, there are no more concessions that the Palestinians and Arabs can give without basically compromising their own survival ability.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, we’re gonna leave it there, As’ad.

Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back here on Intercepted. And before we go on with the show, I wanted to flag for you a story that we just published at theintercept.com. I wrote it along with my colleagues, Alex Emmons, and Ryan Grim. And what the story is, is we obtained a transcript of the phone call that President Donald Trump had last month with the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte. And for people who don’t follow what’s happening in the Philippines, Duterte is a murderous thug who has openly called for the extrajudicial murder of anyone involved with drugs in the Philippines. And thousands and thousands of people have been killed. And Duterte has said he would give immunity or pardon people who are involved with these killings. According to the transcript that we obtained of the phone call between Trump and Duterte, Trump heaped praise on him specifically for the way that he is waging his so-called war on drugs. He also called Duterte a good man, and participated in what is one of Duterte’s favorite topics, bashing Barack Obama.\u003cbr />\nTrump acknowledges that Obama had criticized the tactics Duterte used in the war on drugs, and said that he, unlike Obama, actually understands it and supports it. And just for context, Duterte repeatedly called Obama, “a son of a whore” or “a son of a bitch.” He also said he could go to hell, and he threatened to divorce the United States and tilt his influence toward China or Russia. So, all of that is in the story at theintercept.com. We also have another part of the story that details Trump’s views on North Korea. And Trump speaks very flippantly about the possibility that the U.S. would bomb North Korea. It’s pretty sobering to read those words from a man who is the commander in chief of the United States Armed Forces. Check out that journalism at theintercept.com.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, on Tuesday, former CIA director John Brennan became the latest in what has — in what’s becoming a long line of former U.S. officials, intelligence officials, to testify about Trump and Russia. And, you know, as expected, and as we have seen over and over, Brennan spoke in somber tones about the grave threats posed by Russian attempts to influence the U.S. elections. Brennan also said that he had no evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russian government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Brennan:\u003c/strong> I don’t know whether or not such collusion — and that’s your term — such collusion existed. I don’t know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, as of now, it seems that the former Trump administration or campaign official that’s in the hottest water, so to speak, is Trump’s former national security advisor, General Michael Flynn. Flynn, we learned this week, had received a subpoena from the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, and then promptly said that he was going to assert his Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to testify, or in handing over documents. Now, Flynn could be held in contempt of Congress for all of that, and that in turn could lead to criminal charges against him. In a statement explaining his decision to plead the Fifth, Flynn’s lawyer said the following: “He is the target, on a nearly daily basis, of outrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the United States government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by evidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.”\u003cbr />\nOn Monday, Congressman Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, released a letter alleging that Flynn misled Pentagon officials when he applied for a renewal of his Top Secret security clearances last year. You know, there’s this whole controversy where Trump’s people say, “Oh, it was the Obama administration that gave Flynn his renewed security credentials.” Well, now Elijah Cummings is saying Flynn actually misled Department of Defense officials when he applied for that renewal. And at issue is the money that Flynn was paid when he went to that gala in Russia, and he was paid $45,000 or so by the state-owned network RT. It also was focused on work that Flynn did for Turkey. Flynn apparently did not register in the appropriate way as a foreign agent at that time. And depending on how the facts of that case fill out, that could be a felony. To discuss all of these ongoing questions and investigations, I am joined now by two people. We’re honored to present the debut on Intercepted of The Intercept’s new Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Ryan Grim. Ryan comes to us from the Huffington Post, and he is a true journalistic force unto himself. Ryan, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ryan Grim:\u003c/strong> Longtime listener, first-time caller.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] And we’re also joined now by investigative reporter Matthew Cole, who reports on national security for The Intercept. Matthew, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Matthew Cole:\u003c/strong> Glad to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How do you see this particular moment, where Trump seems to just say, all of this stuff is bullshit. It’s a fabricated conspiracy. You then have the Democrats clinging onto even the tiniest thread of truth in a bigger story to say, this is the equivalent of Watergate, and this guy needs to be impeached, which you’re increasingly hearing. How do you explain to people kind of the context that we’re in right now on Capitol Hill and with the White House?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> To me, there are two realities happening at the same time. You know, the one is, what did actually happen? We don’t quite know. You know, we even have people like Dianne Feinstein saying there’s no evidence yet that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. And that investigation is ongoing in different venues, and increasingly more venues are looking into that. But there is a second reality that is almost more important, and that is the distraction that it’s causing the Trump administration. His ability to repeal Obamacare, or slash taxes, or get any type of energy legislation, or infrastructure plan through Congress depends on him not having a clown show of an administration. And so, the more that this pressure comes on him because of all the Russia scandal, you know, the less he’s able to get done. And that is a reality, even if the other thing is entirely made up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. Matthew Cole, you’ve been covering the national security aspects of the Trump administration, as you did with the Obama administration before. What is your sense of the role of General Flynn right now, who of course was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency? We understand he’s saying that he’s gonna plead the Fifth and not cooperate with the subpoena from the Senate for both documents and his testimony. Is there a “there” there with General Flynn? Does he pose a threat to either Trump or others in the administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> I mean it depends on what the “there” there is. He may very well pose a threat. My question about all of the Russia collusion is whether — the indications that I’ve had from sources inside the intelligence community, and it’s been reflected a little bit in James Clapper’s public testimony up to now, which is that at least initially, in the U.S. intelligence community, there was a lot of smoke, but there wasn’t actually any fire. And the question becomes whether the FBI, in what is now an ongoing but clearly an increased investigation, finds new evidence, whether they can flip someone, whether they can find a witness or someone who will testify that there was something direct going on between people close to and high up in the Trump administration, or the president himself. With the Russian government, there thus far is nothing that indicates that that’s the case. The question I have is whether in the process, what we’re gonna find is that parts of or all of this administration from the day he won was for sale. The policy was for sale.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And when you look at General Flynn from that vantage point, it’s much less interesting that he had a conversation with the Russian ambassador the day before the sanctions, although that’s not without its own intrigue and being questionable. But whether or not he had the permission, for instance, to sign a contract with a Turkish group and essentially lobby for a policy shift or policy changes in the first weeks of the administration. And that really is something that I think fits much more of the MO of someone who looks like a real estate developer from — and by the way, a third borough real estate developer — which is that nothing is not for sale. And if he can find a good deal and thinks that he can get paid, why not have his subordinates around him also paid? And to that end, Flynn, I think, very well could be the undoing of this administration, not because Trump is a secret spy or has been secretly colluding, but because they are crooked and they are incompetent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And John Oliver put it best, he called this “stupid Watergate.” And no matter how much I go through this, I keep seeing the same thing, which is that Trump is moving forward making everything worse, making huge mistakes strategically, politically. I don’t know that it’s because he’s trying to hide from the American public that the Russians worked out a deal with him to get him elected, but rather because, you know, he’s just not that competent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ryan Grim, I wanted to ask you about this issue of what the fuck actually is happening with Trump, because I’m really starting to lean more in the direction of he’s just an idiot when it comes to just a basic level of competency with managing anything, you know, not to mention the United States government. When he was in Israel with Bibi, he arrives there and immediately says publicly —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I never mentioned the word or the name “Israel.” Never mentioned it during that conversation. They were all saying I did. So, you had another story wrong. Never mentioned the word Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> “Look, when I was meeting with the Russians, I didn’t mention Israel at all.” I mean it’s the kind of thing that you’re just astonished that he keeps doing this. Who’s in charge of this administration right now? I mean you had the Jared Kushner camp, Steve Bannon. Is Trump playing some 38\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> dimensional chess here, like the alt-right thinks, or is it something else, and who’s actually running this administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> My sense is that nobody is in charge right now. And I think you’re right, that it really is just incompetence. I mean, for Trump to say to the Russians, “You would not believe the great intel I get,” shows that he has been incompetent his entire life. He is the president of the United States, and he is surprised that he gets good intel. And then feels like nobody else would know that, and that he needs to impress them by sharing this intelligence with these visitors to the Oval Office. He’s just not good at presidenting, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> It’s over his head. What he is good at is creating chaos and disarray because he — and that’s what he’s thrived on his entire career — if you want to call it that. And so, that’s why there’s nobody running the White House. So, Paul Ryan is running the House of Representatives to the best extent of his abilities. Mitch McConnell is running the Senate. But it’s not as if either of them are running Trump, and Trump is certainly not running either of those guys. And so, that means that nobody really is in charge right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But when you talk to people in that administration not publicly, not for an interview, do you ever get a sense from them that they realize how insane everything looks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Oh yes, yes, absolutely. And the game is to try to figure out how to work it to the advantage of your issuer or yourself. And so, there are all of these different, you know, increasingly sophisticated ways that people have of trying to gain advantage or get there. You know, they work to plant articles and then have those printed out and put in front of him, or try to work it through Fox. You know, they know that he’s probably gonna be watching Fox. They know he reads his mentions, which is hilarious if you read his mentions and know that he’s coming across some of this stuff as well. So, there are all these different ways that people are trying to jockey for position. And because he’s not a very complicated guy, it’s just about kind of repetition and luck. Like, how do you get your article that you planted somewhere in front of him? And so, you have to know who the different channels are that are able to get that. A lot of it goes through Kushner and Ivanka. They have a direct line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It’s interesting you bring up people printing out their articles and putting it, you know, on the desk in front of Trump. I was wondering last week when I got a heads up moments before the Blackwater founder, Erik Prince, was gonna be on primetime on Fox with Tucker Carlson, who of course took over from Bill O’Reilly. And the two main points that Erik Prince was really pushing on Fox News — the first was Trump is being very smart about Russia, that the left used to be in love with the Soviet Union.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Erik Prince:\u003c/strong> Look, the Russians suffer from Islamic terrorism as well. This rush to judgment by the left, I guess, is kind of perfect for the Democratic Party, the party of lynch mobs and Jim Crow laws. Rushing to judgment without much fact.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the other one was, you know, of course, Prince’s life’s work, which is, let’s send in a mercenary force to Afghanistan to essentially wipe ‘em all out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EP:\u003c/strong> If you look back in history, the way the English operated in India for 250 years, they had a army that was largely run by companies and no English soldiers. So, very cheap, very low cost, very simple, very — very adaptable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you think is the actual role being played by Erik Prince, and who is he close to in the administration that seems to keep him in play?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Well, we know he’s close to Steve Bannon. I just spoke to someone last week who reiterated again that he was important in the transition because he offered — for instance, the first choice for the National Security Council’s director for Africa was Erik Prince’s choice, who — he had worked with Erik in Africa. That gentleman eventually was fired because the CIA refused to give him security clearances. But it also suggested that he had sway with Flynn. And it turns out that Erik Prince and Michael Flynn have gone back years. So, they knew each other fairly well, and they both reside on the side of viewing Islam as a religion of war and violence, and an existential threat, essentially, to the United States. Bannon still keeps him close. And actually, I was struck while Ryan was talking about, you know, sort of describing the audience of one, which everyone in Washington is currently playing for, that Prince’s interview on Fox News certainly was probably meant for Donald Trump’s ears, because what he prescribed for the Afghanistan policy — first of all, part of it was sensible, which was, “hey, you know, we’ve been at war for 15 or 16 years. We’ve gone through 15 or 16 different generals to lead the war, and we are no closer to a solution now than we were when we began,” which is absolutely true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>His solution to it, though, is providing — that he will sweep in and bring about the changes necessary without having to cost the government very much. And lo and behold, it’ll be his men. Essentially, it’ll be his contractors. I can’t help but think that he’s trying — that was his pitch. He was just sitting there pitching it to the President, that why bother with DOD? We will buttress the Afghan forces and give them what they need, logistics, everything else, and you don’t even need to ship tanks. We’ll provide that for you. And I think there isn’t an opportunity for war that Erik Prince wouldn’t try to sell, especially if it allows him to kill Muslims, regardless of the part of the world. And in this case, because he’s not a stupid man, and he cited, hey, let’s not forget that what Afghanistan has are a trillion dollars in reserves of mineral and lapis, and all sorts of natural resources, that because the country is underdeveloped and because it’s been so violent and unstable, no one has really been able to pull out of the earth yet, and that the United States could get in exchange for providing peace.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we wrap up, Ryan Grim, I want to play with you a game that we started playing recently, which is, how does Trump’s presidency end? Is it impeachment, imprisonment, death from KFC and McDonald’s, or he just says, “Fuck it, I quit”?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> I’d like to answer it on Friday, after the Rob Quist Montana election. If Rob Quist wins, then Republicans start fleeing, and then Democrats take the house. Like, I don’t see how he survives much past that. Well, but then again, what’s the advantage at that point of throwing him out of office? I think that he stumbles into 2020.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You think he makes it through a full first term?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I think that it is quite possible. Or has a heart attack from the stress of actually having to work for the first time in his life and just keels over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Well, having never worked out, by his own theory, he’s saved all of that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> That’s true. He has, yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Inherent energy that he was, so he’s got —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> He’s got arrested heart, fresh heart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> He’s stored up. I mean, I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I don’t know. Melania did bat his hand away, you know, on the tarmac there. That could really hurt the old ego and the heart. Matthew Cole, how does Trump stop being president? What happens?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> I think he quits. But I do think that the Democrats are way too gleeful and way too optimistic about everything that’s transpired in the last couple weeks. People forget that even in Watergate, it was three years between the break-in and the —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Although Democrats are very subtly in Washington putting the breaks on some of the enthusiasm because they don’t want him to quit before 2018.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Yes, yes, absolutely leave office after we pick 25 seats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> That’s a whole other — I just — I don’t think impeachment is any time soon. I don’t know that we’ll ever see anything like that even before 2018. You’d need a new House to come in and basically swing to send impeachment to the Senate, so I don’t think that’s likely. I don’t think he wants to be president. I think he wants the title. I think that being president is hard. I think that’s probably the descriptions so far on his trip about being exhausted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Yeah, it’s day two of his trip.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And I just think he’s not up for it. You know, my guess is that it just gets — it gets so shitty that he just —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Right. He has said it’s harder than he thought it was gonna be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it’s a bummer, and, you know, he just wants to go back to playing golf.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we’re gonna leave it there. Matthew Cole, who reports on national security for the Intercept, thank you very much for being with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Ryan Grim, on behalf of the whole staff of The Intercept, I want to welcome you onboard. We’re really excited to see what you’re gonna do as the D.C. bureau chief for The Intercept. Thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Ah, good to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, earlier in the show, I mentioned that Trump’s royal friends in Saudi Arabia are big fans of beheading people. But I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that we have the death penalty in the U.S. as well. As of today, the United States has officially executed 1,453 people since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Last year, the United States ranked number five in the world in executions, right behind Saudi Arabia. Now, of course, the state-sanctioned murder in the U.S. doesn’t happen in public streets, and it doesn’t come in the form of masked men decapitating people. No, in the U.S., most executions are staged to look like something resembling an operation, where a lethal cocktail of chemicals are injected into the bodies of the condemned. I was thinking about all of this in the context of Trump hanging out with the Saudis. And then I saw the news that the country music singer Toby Keith was doing a male only concert in Saudi Arabia while Trump was there. The concert was free and open to the male public. Now, Trump, we understand, reportedly caught a little bit of that concert on a closed circuit TV as he whizzed past it. He and Melania were in a golf cart riding around before their dinner with King Salman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anyway, all of this got me thinking we should talk to Steve Earle. Steve is the, of course, legendary singer and songwriter, but he’s also spent time in prison himself, and he is a very outspoken opponent of the death penalty. Steve Earle’s catalogue of songs and albums is vast, and he’s an incredibly versatile performer. I love Steve Earle’s music, and I have deep respect for the stands he’s taken, both in his music and in his activism. Steve has a new album that is coming out next month. It’s called “So You Wanna Be An Outlaw.” Steve Earle, it’s our pleasure to welcome you to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Steve Earle:\u003c/strong> It’s good to be here. How you doing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is it like to be you, to be an artist, to be a political artist, when someone like Donald Trump is president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> It’s interesting ‘cause I just made a record that everybody — a lot of people are gonna be disappointed ‘cause it’s probably the least political record I’ve ever made. Maybe not. I mean, nothing I do is completely apolitical ‘cause I’m just kind of a political person, but I was — I’d made a record. I’d written it all, and I recorded it in December, so we knew what the outcome was. And I thought about, well, this record is about a musical statement about where I come from. It’s called “So You Wanna Be An Outlaw,” and it’s sonically based on a Waylon Jennings record called “Honky Tonk Heroes” that was made in 1972 and released in ’73. And that’s the moment I arrived in Nashville and, you know, I’m writing a memoir, and I’m like – you know, I’m getting older, and you start looking back and trying to figure out, you know, why you ended up where you ended up. And that requires looking at where you’ve been. So, I was sort of musically doing that. And I’ve got the best band I’ve ever had. And that’s what the songs are about. And then this happens. And I thought about doing — trying to put something together to make it more political, and I just thought, no. I’m gonna put this record out, and then I’m gonna — I’ve got this band that’s the best I’ve ever had, and I made the country-est record I’ve made in a long time. I’m getting ready to travel around the country for the next year, and Europe, and Australia, and New Zealand, — but pay attention to what’s going on. And making the next record, I imagine, will be just as country, but way more political when it gets right down to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, so you’re gonna play a track for us off that forthcoming album. It’s called “The Firebreak Line.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> This song, I almost made this into a political, you know, screed about a certain issue, but I decided to make it — leave it.

And for some reason, I fell in love with your work in 1998 when I was in Texas covering the trial of the men who killed James Byrd, Jr., African American man who was dragged from the back of a truck.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Amy Goodman:\u003c/strong> Well, Jeremy, why don’t you start off by updating us on what the prosecution said yesterday.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill:\u003c/strong> The prosecution kicked off the day by calling forensic pathologist Dr. Tommy Brown to the stand. He was the doctor who performed the autopsy on the body of James Byrd, Jr. And he said that the 49-year-old disabled African American was alive when his head, neck, and right arm were ripped apart from the rest of his body. And this was very significant for the prosecution case because they’re trying to prove kidnapped. They’re trying to prove that James Byrd, Jr. was alive when they tortured him, when they dragged him two miles through a primarily African American rural community of Jasper, Texas on pavement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What sort of stood out to me in kind of the things you hold onto and remember was the family of James Byrd, Jr. said that they opposed the death penalty for the white supremacist who had unrepentantly murdered their loved one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And I didn’t know anything about you personally at the time, but soon after that, I learned that you had been very outspoken on the death penalty, and that you in fact had spent time in prison. And I wanted to ask you about sort of which came first for your political development. Was it your exposure on a personal level to the criminal justice system in the U.S., or were you predisposed to be that critical as you now are known as?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> The first political activism against the death penalty I ever saw was my father writing a letter to John Connally, who was governor of Texas at the time. And not long before he got shot at the same time John Kennedy was shot, asking him to free — I mean, not to free, but to spare — commute the sentence of a kid called Ralph Carl Powers who had been 17 when he was convicted. And he was a high school dropout, carload of guys, and they ran into a carload – another carload of kids in a supermarket parking lot in South San Antonio. And the gun belonged to a kid named Dicky Renfro. Came from a very good family, but he was kind of a punk. And he and a bunch of his friends, they had the gun. They had the nicer car. But in the scuffle that ensued, somehow Dicky Renfro ended up getting shot with his own gun. And probably by Ralph Powers. It’s entirely possible. But he was a kid, and he didn’t bring a gun. He didn’t – he wasn’t out riding around with a gun. And it just seemed like, you know, one of those cases where not what the death penalty was intended for. But Dicky Renfro’s parents had a lot of money, and the law in Texas at the time allowed for people that had the means to hire a private prosecutor to prosecute a case when they had a vested interest. And Dick Renfro’s family did that, and the DA in San Antonio stood aside and got — one of the best criminal attorneys in the state prosecuted the case. And naturally, Ralph Powers was convicted, and he was sentenced to death. He had nobody to help him in the appeals, and my dad wrote a letter, ‘cause he just didn’t consider that to be fair. And I watched my dad writing this letter, and I asked him why. I was eight, and I asked him, and my dad explained it to me. And it stuck with me. Not too long after that, a few years, ’67, when I was, you know, 12, the film version of “In Cold Blood” came out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Trailer for “In Cold Blood”:\u003c/strong> In Cold Blood. An appalling and apparently senseless crime. Two apparently heartless young criminals. What is the reality behind the appearance?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> In the film when I first saw it, it was Robert Blake is Perry Smith, and he’s getting ready to be executed, and he asks if he can be taken out of the harness so he can go to the bathroom one more time. And he’s told, “Oh, they all do that. They all mess themselves.” And I just thought, God, this dehumanizes us. And I was 12 years old. That was obvious to me. And it’s a lot of — this act of the state executing people in a democracy hurts us, each and every one of us. It makes — it made me feel bad. Opposition to the death penalty came before anything in shaping my politics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hm. What was it about Karla Faye Tucker’s case that captured your —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> Karla Faye Tucker was the first woman executed in the state of Texas since the Civil War, because we sort of have a — our chivalry even extends to felons in the South, and so, we just don’t tend to sentence them to death for some reason. During all of the years that we’ve practiced this barbaric thing, we, for some reason, went easy on the women that were convicted of the same crimes. It’s just interesting. Karla was guilty of a brutal crime. She and her boyfriend were — I mean, they were just cranked to the gills on methamphetamine. Had been up for days. And they went over — they had a grudge against this guy, and they went over to steal motorcycle parts, but mainly to settle a score. And her contribution to the death of these two people was she put several holes in them with a pickax. And she was the pickax murderer. And it was the kind of case that everybody thought the death penalty was made for. And people I knew knew her, and knew that she had changed drastically during the time she was in jail. She became a fund — kind of a fundamentalist Christian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jay Schadler:\u003c/strong> Practically everyone on death row does say they’ve changed. Practically everyone says they’ve found religion. Why are you to be believed?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Karla Faye Tucker:\u003c/strong> I wasn’t born a bad person, and I don’t — I’m not — I don’t have to always be a bad person. I mean, people can change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And eventually, Karla Faye Tucker was executed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> She was executed, after being — they had a dynamic in that election when George Bush was elected the first time. He was on television.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George W. Bush:\u003c/strong> I have sought guidance through prayer. I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority. Karla Faye Tucker has acknowledged she is guilty of a horrible crime. The courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have reviewed the legal issues in this case, and therefore, I will not grant a 30-day stay. May God bless Karla Faye Tucker, and God bless her victims and their families.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> People that probably supported the death penalty were not comfortable with that. So, basically, the state of Texas did not execute another single person until George Bush was safely elected president of the United States. That’s why over yonder, one of those people that he signed a warrant on was a guy named Jonathan Nobles who was one of my death row guys that I visited, and he was finally executed, and I witnessed his execution. And it was just because he asked me to, and he didn’t have anybody else to do it, and he wanted somebody to do it. And I’m still a little pissed off at him about it because it changed me a lot. I mean it changed the way I do this work, this activism. I don’t get personally involved with inmates anymore. I just can’t afford it. I can’t afford to go through that again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Over Yonder,” Steve Earle]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Tonight we’ll cross the yard together\u003cbr />\nThen they can’t hurt me anymore\u003cbr />\n‘Cause I’m going over yonder\u003cbr />\nWhere no ghost can follow me\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, he invited you to be a witness to his execution. And at that time, how was Texas executing people?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> Lethal injection. Seemed pretty violent to me. He was singing “Silent Night.” That was the signal. He just told them that — they always usually arrive at a signal so that they can, you know — so that they don’t have to — it isn’t so dramatic. Something is agreed between the warden and the inmates, what they’d started doing in Texas by that time. And I wasn’t privy to this. I wasn’t in on that conversation. I went in with the other witnesses, and I stood there. He apologized to them, and then he said, “Steve, I can’t believe I had to go through all this to see you in a suit.” And I was just, you know — just the best joke he could come up with. And then he quoted a Bible verse, and then he suddenly started singing “Silent Night.” And that was the signal that they’d agreed on, and on the line “Mother and child,” I’ll never forget it, he suddenly stopped, and his head pitched violently forward — violently enough that his glasses — big, heavy, prison issues glasses — fell off of his head and onto his chest. And, you know, then he started to turn blue. And, you know, I don’t – at first, when it was over with, I went, oh no, I closed my eyes. I didn’t do what I came here to do. And then I realized later on that I’d seen every second of it. I was just in shock, and it took a while for that part of my memory to fill back in again. It was bizarre.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wow.

I know you’ve seen a lot of stuff like that. And that’s horrific in it’s own way; there’s not any doubt about it. But it is — there’s something — we’re doing it, number one. We can’t opt out of it. My opposition to the death penalty’s based on — I still believe that we’re at least in, you know, a nominal democracy, and that if the government executes people, then I’m executing people.

He was 20 years old, and he was duct taped to a board, you know, in Afghanistan before they even flew him out of there. They shot that footage of him. And it didn’t air until several days later. But I think back — I think he was already in the States or on his way back to the States by the time we saw the footage from Afghanistan. But —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And for people that remember, a CIA agent had been killed in Afghanistan and was believed to have been killed in a battle where John Walker Lindh was there, so that elevated the stakes —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In the media of the way it was portrayed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SE:\u003c/strong> Basically what happened was the CIA agent was in this compound — this fort, as they called it. It wasn’t quite that. It was a fort, about as much a fort as the Alamo was. And he was the only guy there, and as far as anybody could tell. And when the place kind of blew up, he just — God knows what happened to him. Nobody knows who killed him. And John Walker Lindh was there. And he went to fight. He — John Walker Lindh was from Marin County. He converted to Islam there. He traveled, you know, to the Mideast to study the Koran, and left with a bunch of other jihadis to go – when the war broke out in Afghanistan, he was with a bunch of other people at one of those schools, and he took off and traveled with them. And who knows – nobody knows that he ever picked up a gun, you know? Nobody’s ever proven that. He hasn’t ever been convicted of anything. He accepted a plea deal for 20 years in prison because they, you know – guess he knew what would happen if he went to any prison and he ever got into the general population. The only thing, worse thing he could be, you know, than a sex offender who preyed on children at that point in our history would have been somebody that had been, you know, convicted of — and they called him a traitor.\u003cbr />\nHe was called a traitor over, and over, and over again. He was never even charged with treason. And the reason they didn’t — trust me, if they thought they could have made a case for treason, they would have charged him, but they didn’t. I saw a skinny 20-year-old kid taped — duct taped to a board, and I have a child that’s exactly the same age, and his name’s Justin Townes Earle, and he was 20 at the time. And my first reaction to it was, “Oh my God, he’s got parents.” So, that’s why I reacted to it. That’s why I wrote the song. It really isn’t a political song.

But did he make the Russians an offer they couldn’t refuse? This week on Intercepted: The scandal spotlight shines on Trump’s influential (and strangely quiet) son-in-law as questions abound over Kushner’s alleged meetings with Russian officials to establish secret back channel communications. We talk to amateur punk rocker turned national security correspondent Spencer Ackerman of The Daily Beast. Organizer and scholar Mariame Kaba offers a people&#8217;s history of prisons in the U.S. and the politicians — both Democrats and Republicans — who have made them what they are today. And we hear an incredible rendition of “The Partisan” from composers and musicians Leo Heiblum of Mexico and Tenzin Choegyal of Tibet.

I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 17 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Stronger we’re getting. Have you feeling it? Are you feeling it? [Crowd cheers] All that new equipment is coming in. You saw what we did with our military budget — way up. Took a little heat on that one, but it’s okay with me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What a strange world we all inhabit. Donald Trump attacks traditional U.S. allies from his Twitter account, and German chancellor Angela Merkel hits back from a Bavarian beer hall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chancellor Angela Merkel:\u003c/strong> (Speaking German) We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The brief hiatus Trump took from Twitter aggression while he was abroad, loving on the Saudis and Israelis, hating on the Europeans and NATO, that’s come to a screeching halt, and Trump is back to his tweeting and to his old ways. The scandals that plagued Trump, however, have not abated. If anything, they’re intensifying. The spotlight right now — and it’s an ever-shifting spotlight — seems to have moved a bit from General Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, and landed on Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. And the focus is on reports that Kushner secretly commiserated with Russian officials to set up some sort of a back channel that would evade the snooping ears and eyes of even U.S. intelligence. We’re gonna dig into all of that in a moment. But first, I just wanted to say a word about Trump and NATO.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This public kerfuffle between Trump and Merkel and other European NATO powers — in the media, it’s centered around Trump sort of sticking his thumb in the eyes of European allies and lashing out at them for not paying enough money to support NATO, not contributing enough forces to be used in various wars. The cable networks love to show the reaction of other world leaders to Trump’s theatrics. And I’ll admit, some of it was pretty damn funny.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bruce Johnson (WUSA 9):\u003c/strong> Video from the NATO summit in Belgium. President Trump appears to shove aside the Prime Minister of Montenegro to get to the front of the group. Talk about putting America first.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But what gets lost in all of this, and this is true of the way Trump is covered in general, is that NATO is not just some, like, benevolent force in the world. NATO is often, when you want to boil it down to it, a militaristic arm of U.S. hegemony. It’s used at times to circumvent United Nations authorities to conduct legally dubious military actions. NATO has been used for regime change and for offensive wars. NATO is an alliance, for the most part, of powerful white Western countries, and their leader, and their governments, defending their so-called free market economic policies. There should be a debate about NATO. There should be a debate about NATO, the U.S., and Europe. But not the one that Trump and Merkel and the other European leaders are having. And that’s sort of indicative of the moment that we’re in. Whatever stupid shit Trump says or does, the latest gaffe or embarrassment that consumes so much media attention — that and the various palace intrigues and the Russia investigation. Take a step back and consider who benefits from all of this chicanery. Among the chief beneficiaries is without a doubt the national security state in this country. Trump doesn’t want to bother himself with the detailed intel briefings. He wants pictures. He wants his name written into each sentence so that he pays attention to it. But Trump has told the CIA that they get everything that they want, everything that they need.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I want to just let you know, I am so behind you. And I know maybe sometimes you haven’t gotten the backing that you’ve wanted. And you’re gonna get so much backing. Maybe you’re gonna say, “Please don’t give us so much backing.” [Crowd laughs] “Mr. President, please, we don’t need that much backing.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The CIA is an agency that thrives when there is no meaningful oversight. In a way, Trump and his kind of lazy approach to intelligence and oversight — Trump’s taking the CIA back to the glory days before the Church Commission, and the U.S. military, too. It’s not operating with far less restraint and rules than existed under President Obama, who gave the military quite a bit of latitude in his own right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Amy Robach (ABC News):\u003c/strong> Just moments ago, there was another new round of airstrikes in Yemen overnight, following that January raid that killed Navy Seal —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Maryam Nemazee (Al Jazeera):\u003c/strong> Activists say at least 106 people have been killed by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes in the Syrian province —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barbara Starr (CNN):\u003c/strong> Force dropped a 21,000-pound bomb in Eastern Afghanistan, the first use ever of this weapon in combat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When it comes to military operations under President Donald Trump, the generals are calling the shots. And they are pushing the envelope.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Dickerson (CBS):\u003c/strong> What keeps you awake at night?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Secretary of Defense James Mattis:\u003c/strong> Nothing. I keep other people awake at night.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You now have boots on the ground, raids happening in Yemen, huge numbers of civilians being killed as the U.S. intensifies its operations in Syria and Iraq. Now, there’s going to be another surge inside of Afghanistan. These institutions, the CIA, the military — they fiercely defend their turf. And they’re not gonna want to give back an inch when whoever succeeds Trump gets into office —just something to consider as we chase the rabbit in all of these Trump scandals. But we do have to chase the rabbit to a degree. We have to cover these stories. Why? Because these are the things, the Russia stuff, the emoluments, what deals Trump has made in secret — those are the things that may actually end this presidency if he doesn’t die or quit. Or at least, they could end the tenure of some very high profile advisors and associates of Trump. Kushner, Jared Kushner, who is sort of — he’s like Trump’s less savvy Tom Hagen — you know, the consigliore to Don Corleone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tom Hagen (The Godfather):\u003c/strong> I have a special practice. I handle one client. Now, you have my number. I’ll wait for your call.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He’s a rich kid who married another rich kid whose dad became president. And Jared Kushner, the little rich kid who married the other rich kid — he’s now making decisions that impact the lives of hundreds of millions, potentially billions, of people around the world. Well, young Jared is now facing scrutiny and potential serious investigation over allegations that he tried to set up this secret communication pipeline with the Russians. To defend Kushner, over the weekend, the Trump administration wheeled out Homeland Security Secretary General John Kelly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>General John Kelly: \u003c/strong>I think any time you can open lines of communication with anyone, whether they’re good friends or not so good friends, is a smart thing to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, depending on what we learn about Jared’s actual conversations regarding this secret channel, General Kelly may live to regret his defense of this kid. And now we also understand that Jared was one of the key people urging President Trump to fire FBI Director James Comey. And that raises a whole other set of issues. Why did Jared push for that? Is there an innocent explanation, or did they know part of what was coming? Well, Jared is now lawyered up. Trump is lawyering up. There’s now an independent investigator in the form of former FBI Director Robert Mueller. To talk about all of this, I’m joined now by Spencer Ackerman. He was, of course, part of the Pulitzer Prize-winning team at The Guardian newspaper that covered the initial Edward Snowden revelations — of course, Glenn Greenwald, one of our co-founders, also a part of that. Spencer is now the senior national security correspondent at the Daily Beast. Spencer, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Spencer Ackerman:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let’s start with the most recent news about Jared Kushner, and the reports that he opened or sought to open a secret line of communication with Moscow before Trump actually became president. The story goes it would have involved going into the Russian embassy and communicating with them. The White House now says that the point of that had to do with coordinating Syria policy. What’s your analysis of what’s happening right now with Jared Kushner?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> It strikes me that Kushner would have no idea that his interactions with Russian officials would be monitored — that this would be one of the premiere intelligence collection targets in the United States. That whatever the Russians would have, whether it’s Kislyak talking back to his superiors or through a different channel, be highly attractive for interception. Would require no legal pretext. It’s already, you know, baked into the pie there. So, if anyone was going to do this, it strikes me that Kushner is the plausible candidate to do this. You know, with someone like Mike Flynn, it becomes harder to understand how someone who, you know, spent his career in the bowels of this system could have been that reckless. I guess we have to say allegedly that reckless. But with Kushner, particularly given depth of experience in international business deals, of being part of the Trump entourage, as well as on his own, that he would have probably thought he could just have this sort of freedom of movement, this ease of communication.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The really shocking thing is that if the story is true — and, you know, it’s going to be heavily investigated in the months, if not years, to come — you know, the salient part isn’t the back channel itself. It’s making sure that there wouldn’t be any record of it going back to the U.S. intelligence agencies and other formal channels. When back channels are typically set up, the way they work is that those people inside the intelligence community are precisely the ones who actually do know that this is going on, that the most salient distinction between previous back channels and whatever this turns out to be, what’s being discussed here with Kushner is that he wants to make sure that the U.S. side, including those aspects of the U.S. intelligence community — that, particularly at the point in time at which this is supposed to have occurred, are really spun up about counterintelligence risks — don’t know that it’s happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How unusual are all of the things that we’re hearing about in the Trump administration: The calls that Flynn had, the possibility that Jared Kushner was trying to set up this back channel, the Russians showing up at the RNC and meeting with all of these people that ended up either in the White House or being very close to Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> The Russians showing up at the RNC is probably the most, for lack of a better term, normal aspect of everything that you just mentioned. Again, the really significant part of this Kushner story is that precisely the people who were supposed to know about this so that it doesn’t appear, on its face to be, you know, frankly, the Russians flipping someone, or someone — if you or I were to walk into a Russian embassy, if we were to walk into a Russian-aligned intelligence facility, if we were to walk into a Russian restaurant where we knew that there were several different layers of contact protected through plausible deniability, and said, “I want to set up a mechanism of communication. I want to make sure that, you know, people who might be interested in it on the American side don’t know about it. And by the way, I’m connected to the most powerful person in the world by marriage.” In intelligence circles, that’s typically understood as a walk-in. That’s typically understood as someone deciding that they want to play ball with a hostile, or at least foreign, intelligence service, which would, kind of under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, get you in kind of like the bright line territory of probable cause to get your communications intercepted, even outside of this particular arrangement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, when we hear reports that the President’s son-in-law is trying to make sure that there is a communications channel that U.S. intelligence doesn’t know about: that’s highly, highly suspect to those inside the intelligence agencies, and sets off a process that would be probably charitably described as a debate about whether there is a policy aspect to it, or whether this becomes something much more clandestine and, for lack of a better term, sinister, or at least suspect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In the time we have left, I wanted to also ask you what you think is going to come of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election. And do you think there will be indictments of Trump circle people? I mean, is Flynn gonna get indicted? Do they have enough goods on him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> I mean, I really don’t know. I’m as fascinated by this question as you are and as everyone else is. I wish I could say that I had the visibility into this investigation in which to sort of speak confidently on it —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s the most damning thing that you’ve seen of all of this? You know, we talk about, you know, the difference between smoke and fire. But what is the most damning path that you could go down in terms of a “there” there with Trump or his people?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> I think straight up, on – just on its face, whatever it is that you think about Jim Comey — and I don’t think Comey could ever read my reporting and say that I’m a fan of Jim Comey — the moment that he has an active investigation into the President of the United States and the President of the United States’ allies, and the President fires the FBI director: that’s just on its face obstruction of justice. Now, with this Kushner story, it also looks on the face of it that a contributing factor to Trump trying to get Comey to stifle this investigation is to protect the President’s son-in-law. Trump seems to have, no matter what, an affinity for Mike Flynn.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he’s been treated very, very unfairly by the media. As I call it, the fake media, in many cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> You know, to be maximally charitable, Flynn was a guy who gave Trump military credibility at a time when he had none. Nevertheless, he keeps on going back and back and back to Flynn. We know he visited Russian intelligence. He was at a really weird RT dinner with Vladimir Putin. Something’s going on. Something is just there. Whatever it is, there are too many data points for it to seem like this is all, you know, fake news. So, now that we hear about this off the books Kushner backchannel, one of the things that — I think it was the Washington Post that noted, a few short weeks after this supposed backchannel conversation gets entered into between Kushner and Kislyak, your old buddy Erik Prince actually acts as a Trump backchannel. How paranoid should we be? How paranoid should I be that someone with such extensive experience in running a paramilitary private company is kind of a go-to Trump guy? At my most paranoid, I’m asking, like, is this Trump’s contingency plan? Are we gonna see, like, you know, whatever in the world Trump’s, you know, current company is called now, you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You mean Prince’s or Trump’s?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> I’m sorry, Prince’s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump’s is called the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Trump’s is called Trump. Trump’s is called the United States, and it’s definitely called Trump. The best I’ve ever been owned on Twitter, by the way, is someone who once referred to me as an off-brand Scahill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ooh, ouch.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> I spent like about a minute trying to figure out if I was offended by that or if it’s just fundamentally fact, so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> People can call you an off-brand Scahill. I also give you major props for keeping it real with the 3\u003csup>rd\u003c/sup> Bass haircut.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You definitely have the MC Serch thing going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> This has been a thing with you for years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I know, because I you think you — you’re the only person — you’re the only white guy I’ve ever seen that can master the high top fade.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Spencer Ackerman, it’s been awesome having you on Intercepted.

And we’ve been really blessed with some amazing contributors and contributions. Part of the reason why we made that a component of this show is because people who advocate fascist policies, who run wars on immigrants, and women, and the poor, and people of color — historically, they don’t want vibrant culture or artistic expression. Because music is really what — it keeps us going. It provides anthems for struggles and for change. This week, my friend, Leo Heiblum, is visiting New York. Leo is originally from Mexico, and he is an incredible musician and composer. He and I got to know each other several years ago when Leo was working with the actor Gael García Bernal on a documentary film about a undocumented immigrant who makes a journey through Central America and ends up in the United States, and then is found dead in the Arizona desert. That film was called “Who is Dayani Cristal?” It’s a great film. If you haven’t seen it, you should check it out. Well, Leo did the score and the music for that excellent film. And then this other musical artist, singer/composer Tenzin Choegyal, who is a Tibetan living in exile — they met each other just the other night. And then they came into our studio to perform together, and — well, I’ll just shut up, and I’ll let them introduce themselves and the song that they’re gonna share with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Leo Heiblum:\u003c/strong> My name is Leo Heiblum, and I’m from Mexico City — “Chilango” from Mexico.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tenzin Choegyal:\u003c/strong> I’m Tenzin Choegyal, a Tibetan in exile and now living in Australia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> I am staying at Philip Glass’ house here in New York, which is where I usually stay, and that’s a great place to meet friends and musicians. And I was just there with my instrument and playing the tabla, and Tenzin came, and we just started jamming. And now we’re playing together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TC:\u003c/strong> I derive my musical image from Tibetan nomadic tradition, but then I improvise it into an experimental sound. And then for me, it’s like a drifting cloud without having to be bothered about the geographical boundaries that are created by the human beings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> I have a grandfather from Poland, and my grandmother from Egypt. My parents are from Mexico, but I was born in Mexico. But I was never — I never felt as a Mexican because everywhere, people would talk to me in English. I’ve been looking for music everywhere all my life. I spent a long time in India in a place where Tenzin also spent a lot of time. And there, I studied the tabla, and then I found this amazing traditional Mexican instrument about ten years ago, the jarana. And I’ve been going to the communities. And the jarana and the son jarocho is an amazing place to find music that is alive and that is really changing the dynamics of the community. It’s so wonderful. I was in a car with Gael going to the Morelia Film Festival, and we were listening to Leonard Cohen. And he was like, “Man, we should do a song by Leonard Cohen in a traditional Mexican style.” And we were doing this film called “Who is Dayani Cristal?” And we just came up on “The Partisan” and we were listening to the lyrics, and it’s about immigration. And it’s — then we did our research, and then we found out that it wasn’t a Leonard Cohen song, that it was actually a much older song.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TC:\u003c/strong> It was — and it’s really related to still now, like the situations that we are now in the political factors that are dividing the countries, dividing human beings. And, you know, like the division of people against people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LH:\u003c/strong> There’s a particular paragraph that we were talking about this morning that says, “I have changed my name so often. I have lost my wife and children, but I have many friends, and some of them are with me.” And that’s a Mexican migrant, that’s a Tibetan migrant, that’s like —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TC:\u003c/strong> So many oftentimes, we have changed our names, and to suit the situations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“The Partisan,” Leo Heiblum and Tenzin Choegyal]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Leo Heiblum is a musician and a composer from Mexico, and Tenzin Choegyal is a composer and musician in exile from Tibet.

Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back here at Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill. In the current media climate in this country, and with Donald Trump being Donald Trump, there are so many vital issues and important stories that get little to no attention. The civilians killed in U.S. wars, the plight of the truly poor in this country, the struggles of working people. The climate. The campaign. The moves to attack women’s healthcare. The efforts to kick millions of people off of any kind of healthcare. Racism is sometimes discussed in the media in this country, but these days, it’s often through the lens of some Trump associate, or in the context of covering the so-called alt-right phenomenon. Politicians in this country, Democrats and Republicans, always seem to jockey for position, particularly at election time, for who’s the strongest law and order candidate. You know, the Hillary Clinton “superpredator” comment that she made in the 1990s resurfaced during the presidential race last year. Less discussed, though, were the policies that her husband enacted as president that she helped advocate as First Lady. But when it came to, you know, law and order, at least on a rhetorical level, like, Trump took the spiel to new heights.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I am the law and order candidate!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> While both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tried and at times fumbled to address to growing Black Lives Matter movement, which of course is a decentralized movement — it arose in protest of the police killings of black people in this country — Trump didn’t even pretend that it was a serious issue, that it was a real issue. In fact, Trump often mocked it. He did not take the issue seriously. Beyond the rhetoric, Trump put a proven racist, Jeff Sessions, in charge of the Justice Department as attorney general.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Attorney General Jeff Sessions:\u003c/strong> Unfortunately, in recent years, law enforcement as a whole has too often been unfairly maligned and blamed for the crimes and unacceptable deeds of a few in their ranks. Amid this intense public scrutiny and criticism, morale has gone down, while the murder of police officers killed in the line of duty has gone up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Stocks in private prisons skyrocketed in the aftermath of Trump’s election. We really learned the David Clark, the Milwaukee County sheriff, was going to be getting a top post at the Department of Homeland Security.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sheriff David Clarke:\u003c/strong> Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear. Blue lives matter in America!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sheriff Clarke was a big hit at the Republican Convention, where he showed up looking like a military general, or at least he wanted to appear as one, with all of his little medallions on his police uniform. But back in Milwaukee County — and I’m from Milwaukee — Clarke faces very serious questions about a string of suspicious deaths that have taken place in holding cells, jails, that are under his control. But he’s apparently on his way to Washington. Now, when Trump and his administration talk about crime and imprisonment in the black community, they do it with no historical context. They feed what I would call a racist narrative in addressing some of these staggering statistics. More than 60 percent of people in prison today are people of color. Black men are nearly six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men, and Hispanic men are more than twice as likely. For black men in their 30s, one in every ten is in prison or jail on any given day. The rate of imprisonment for African American women is more than twice that of white women. Right now, the United States has more than two million people in prison. That’s a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. That’s the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Joining me now is the organizer and educator Mariame Kaba. She is the founder of Project NIA and a co-organizer of Survived and Punished. She’s also one of the sharpest people I know on Twitter, where her handle is @prisonculture. Mariame, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mariame Kaba:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, you refer to yourself as an abolitionist. What do you mean by that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Abolition for me is a long-term project, and also a practice around creating the conditions that would allow for the dismantling of prisons, policing, and surveillance, and the creation of new institutions that actually work to keep us safe, and are not fundamentally oppressive. What you need to make those conditions happen, you have to be for addressing environmental issues. You have to be for making sure people have a living wage economically. I think — I know for me, it’s important to be anti-capitalist. All those things feed into creating the conditions that would lead to the end of the things I want to see, and the bringing into being of the things I want to have.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> For people who don’t have a loved one that’s been to prison, haven’t been to prison themselves, who just sort of view prison as a place where people who commit crimes go —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Set a kind of context for people of the institution of imprisonment in the United States and what that looks like.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Prison itself is a reform. I think that’s something that most people don’t think about, right? Prisons haven’t always existed. They came into being, especially in the United States, because people were trying to react against capital punishment and corporal punishment, which were seen at the time, by particularly Quakers, as incredibly inhumane. So, initially, the reform itself was not meant to be a brutalizing thing. But isolation itself is actually brutal. Over the years, prisons have been spaces where we’ve sent the people we don’t like, or the people we want to manage and control socially. Early before the Civil War, most people who were locked up were not actually black people, because almost every black person in the country was enslaved. Immediately after, you know, Emancipation, all of a sudden, the literally complexion of prisons change, and black people become kind of hyper targets of that system. And we create new laws, the black codes, other things like that. Convict lease system comes into being as a way to continue to exploit the labor of the people who are now newly free.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The reason to talk about that history is also to demystify for people how and why people ended up behind bars initially, that it wasn’t really about real crime, but it was about a perception of blacks as inherently criminal in order to continue to control blacks, who people thought after enslavement actually didn’t have a right to be free, that black people couldn’t manage freedom. And that was the story that got told. And so, the prison became a site for continuing to control blackness. And we have arrived in the late 1960s, when there was a rise in murder and in robberies particularly. So, kind of violent crimes are rising at the same time as the Black Power movement is also expanding. And these two things are being brought together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bobby Seale:\u003c/strong> Well, now, brother Martin King exhausted the means of nonviolence with his life being taken by some racist. What is being done to us is what we hate, and what happened to Martin Luther King is what we hate. You’re darn right we respect nonviolence. But to sit and watch ourselves be slaughtered like our brother? We must defend ourselves, as Malcolm X said, by any means necessary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> The story that gets told is that, you know, it’s mainly Nixon who comes in and puts in the kind of War on Drugs, the beginning of the War on Drugs, and he was like the Republicans are to blame for how the carceral state got built more massively.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Nixon:\u003c/strong> America’s public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Between 1825 until like the late 1960s, the prison population is stable. It’s pretty low. In the late 1960s, you’ve got all these scholars and activists talking about the end of prison. People are talking about the prison as being over. So, you have to think about like how we went from like the end of prison to all of a sudden, the largest jailer in the whole entire international sphere in the world becomes the United States. And that’s because of a set of policies that come into play. And those policies are bipartisan policies, but really take off with Johnson, where Johnson wants to fight the war on poverty, and he gives in on creating a war on crime arm of the war on poverty. And what do the Republicans do, which they always do so well? They want to defund the poverty angle, and they want to keep the war on crime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was the motivation in your assessment of these politicians, both Democrats and Republicans?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> It was “the riots.” It was the images of those young black people in Watts, and 1964 in Harlem. And all these places where there were “urban disorder and urban unrest.” And the face of that were black young people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> Six days of rioting in the Negro section of Los Angeles left behind scenes reminiscent of war-torn cities. More than a hundred square blocks were decimated by fire and looters, and few buildings were left intact. Firemen were harassed by snipers and brick-throwing hoodlums as they attempted to control the fires, many of which were left to burn themselves out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> This is why you can’t talk about incarceration, criminalization in this country without understanding the history of blackness and black people in this country, the ways in which the politicians have used us basically as the fuel to make things happen, that then bleed out to the rest of the population. So, we’re always the canaries in the coalmine. We go into Bill Clinton and what he does with the 1994 crime bill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill Clinton:\u003c/strong> When I sign this crime bill, we together are taking a big step toward bringing the laws of our land back into line with the values of our people, and beginning to restore the line between right and wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Which actually doesn’t have that much of an impact in terms of spiking the numbers even higher. What he does it give people more of an ideological basis to continue to do what they’ve been doing. He was one of the most destructive presidents for black people. And we’re still trying to recover from his reign, both in terms of what he put into place around immigration and immigrant detention. A lot of people don’t think about that as black, but the people who are most incarcerated within immigrant detention are disproportionately black immigrants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and of course, you had this massive atrocity that happened at Guantanamo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> With Haitians —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> That’s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who were fleeing violence that the United States sponsored in the form of overthrowing Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And then you had — I think a lot of people, particularly young people, don’t know this history. Before Guantanamo was the place where Bush stuck people extra-judicially in the so-called War on Terror, Clinton piled bodies inside of Guantanamo of the first independent black republic in the Western hemisphere, Haiti.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> That’s right. It came back to haunt Hillary Clinton in Miami with the Haitians that were there not voting for her, right? So, there’s — people have long memories. But welfare reform, or what we call welfare deform, had such a disproportionate impact, particularly on single black mothers. The ways in which the carceral state was kind of reinforced and made much more brutal through the three strikes laws, through the mandatory minimum sentences, which were up through his horrific behavior around rushing back to Arkansas during his election to go and put somebody who was mentally disabled to death, right? He really set in place the apparatus that we are still trying to dismantle today.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Under Obama, you had several incendiary killings that happened. You had George Zimmerman murdering Trayvon Martin. You had the shooting of Mike Brown. And we can go down a whole list of people. I remember as a kid growing up in Milwaukee, the police shooting an unarmed black man named Ernest Lacy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> 1981. Ernest Lacy suffocated in the back of a police van after officers arrested him for a rape he didn’t commit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> These kinds of killings have always happened in this country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Always, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was it about this string of incidents that seemed to rejuvenate a rebellious atmosphere in this country that was in large part led by young African Americans and other people of color across this country? And they weren’t being organized by Al Sharpton or some national network. It was a spontaneous response. Given that this has happened from the beginning of this republic to black people from white people in authority or people with a badge, what was it about that particular moment that seemed to spark this uprising?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Almost every urban uprising that has occurred in the country’s history has police violence at its root. So, if you look at the 1935 Harlem “riots,” or Harlem uprising, at the core of it is a rumor that a young Puerto Rican boy is killed, but he wasn’t actually killed. And that sparks the conflagration. In 1943, that rebellion in Harlem, also at the root was Marjorie Polite and this young man, and the police basically being accused of having shot him. That’s a conflagration. 1964 is also a young black man who’s shot by the cops in New York City.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker (1964):\u003c/strong> In the name of God, please go home and protect the dignity of our Harlem community!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Crowd chanting:\u003c/strong> Bring back Malcolm X! Bring back Malcolm X!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Acting Mayor Paul Screvane:\u003c/strong> I view these developments with the utmost seriousness, and have given approval to all necessary steps to ensure and maintain the rule of law and order in this as well as all other parts of the city to insure, for example, against the disorder by contagion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> If you look at just the history of all the different uprisings, you can go back to the early 1900s, and all of those are cases that are sparked by police brutality. And the reason that that’s the case, and it’s always been the case in this country, is because it is the most clear example of being treated unjustly in the country. It’s the clearest way that almost every black person can see that they are second class. In other things, it’s diffuse, right? We know there are poor people. But if you yourself are not poor, in this country, you can pretend they don’t exist. And that includes black people. You can live in a way that, like, ignores the black poor people. Except that many, many black people are tied to poor people anyway, even if they left their communities. Most of — a lot of their family still is struggling. So, we see it in a different kind of way. But just not having the right to exist, to walk down the street without being harmed, that consistent knowledge of that is something that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> By the people who taxpayers are financing to supposedly keep order and safety.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> The gatekeepers of the state are turning their — literally their guns on us. And so, it is a, like — it’s a sight that makes sense, where people feel a direct visceral sense that this is friggin’ unfair. What are they doing to us? And that’s been along the way. I think this most — that’s why it’s important to put the movement for black lives that’s currently been — that continues to happen right now in its proper context. It’s only part of a long freedom struggle that has gone on in this country for as long as lack people have been here\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Because I know you’re originally from New York, but you’ve spent the past years organizing and working in Chicago, where you also studied. And I’m curious about what your analysis is of the very high murder rate in Chicago, the proliferation of weapons on the streets, and what the kind of root cause of it is. You know, my family is from Chicago. My dad is from Hyde Park. My brother and sister live in Chicago. And we’ve seen a pretty radical change in the violence levels in Chicago, or at least the reporting on it. And Donald Trump harped on this constantly in the campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And then you look at Chicago. What’s going on in Chicago?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Chicago became the kind of epic dog whistle for politicians who wanted to say, “the problem is when black people have guns.” And Chicago is basically, well — Spike Lee said “Chiraq,” but, you know, you had Lupe Fiasco the hip-hop artist say, “well, we need General Stanley McChrystal to come in here and take control of Chicago.” What is at the heart of the violence that we’re seeing right now in Chicago, in your view?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> In Chicago, you have to look at the whole history of what has happened. First and foremost, the last three years have been where we’ve seen homicide rates go up. But that preceded almost 15 years of it consistently going down. I think that you have to look at the disinvestment that has been going on in the last ten years. Things take time to catch up. I mean, and this is a city run by Democrats who — it’s a city that is the test case for neoliberal economics of all different sorts. The privatization of schools, the privatization of mental health clinics, the ways in which economic violence is being done to particular communities on the West and on the South sides of Chicago. Those are the places that are the most dangerous. There’s an inequality to violence in Chicago. You can be on the North side in downtown, living your life. It’s like you’re living in another country. So, I think that there are many, many reasons for why this is, and I think we’re gonna be in a moment where we’re gonna see whether or not we’re gonna revert back to the lock them up kind of way of the late 1980s and ‘90s, or that we’ve learned anything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When it became clear that Donald Trump was going to be president, to what did you attribute his victory?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> I think there are so many things. He ran against a terrible candidate, I still maintain. I don’t think that Hillary Clinton was good in terms of a contrast to him. So, I think that was real. I think the Electoral College and the way that relic from slavery that exists really to disempower majorities to actually put in who they want in office, I think you cannot discount just the completely xenophobic and racist and sexist forces and internalized oppressions that exist within this country. I said through the entire election, I said, “This is an election for white people arguing with other white people about how to deal with the rest of us.” I kept saying it before the election. I said — like, it just felt that way. Like, the arguments that were being had, Chicago as a trope, right? Like, not even a dog whistle, like a high C, you know, high key kind of yelling and primordial scream. I think that they just, you know — a lot of white poor people — and I just want to say this because I think this is important too. There’s too much emphasis being put on the white working class. And I don’t mean that in the sense that we shouldn’t be paying attention to them. But they’re not the — they’re being put as the scapegoat for why Trump came into office. His base is middle class people and rich white people. Like, rich white middle class people are the real base for the Republican Party. They’re the ones who put him in there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>White working class people vote at a low rate compared to middle class and rich people. Just sheer number-wise, there are not enough to have put him over the edge, right? But I find it interesting how white folks are so quick to throw poor white people under the bus, to blame them for why Trump came into being. No, no! 53 percent of white women voted for him. They weren’t all white working class women, right? So, I’m like, uh-uh. Don’t do that. You know, I think that we — like, think white working class people vote at a low rate, just like poor black people vote at a low rate. That’s been the case for time immemorial, if you look at like the statistics of voting. So, yes, while some poor white people have racial resentments and, you know, are animated by racism, this country is racist. And any appeals to “othering” other people at the benefit of white people are going to be seized. I think it is important to say that the majority of people didn’t even vote for him. He won because of the Electoral College, yes. And that’s the system. I’m not trying to overturn the current election. I just think that we should really look at what has happened and tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s the significant of Jeff Sessions being the attorney general?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> I think he’s a racist ideologue, clearly. I would not have wanted him to be the dogcatcher-in-chief. He should not be in office. He should not – it was good that he wasn’t a judge, you know? All those things are true. He is a racist ideologue who is overseeing a racist, classist, sexist, transphobic system. The criminal punishment system is — are those things, whether Jeff Sessions is the attorney general or not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. I mean, there’s a level — I mean, I agree with you, and I think there’s a level on which it’s kind of refreshing that the person who is the figurehead actually represents the legacy of the institution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> He represents the actual institution. So, now, you’re gonna have to look at that system to understand that it isn’t one man, but it is the whole damn thing that has to go, right? People keep saying, you know, the system is guilty. The whole damn system has to go, and people are chanting. This is absolutely the case in this case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but look at what’s happening in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey, the FBI director. There’s this lionization of the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the CIA, for that matter, by the Democrats. But on the Comey issue, it’s really is like, oh my god, Jim Comey was the last honest man in this country, and the FBI was keeping us safe and has all this integrity. What is your response to the dominant kind of liberal narrative now, white liberal narrative that the FBI is on our side, and they’re the good guys, and they’re the ones keeping us safe?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> But white liberals love the cops. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, they always have loved the cops. I don’t know that this is new, you know? Like, the cops are in all of our heads and hearts, but they’re very much in liberals’. You know, think about how the conversation is framed around cops and policing. Think about Obama. The whole — his whole entire conversation of policing has been a few bad apples. But most of the cops are great. No real drilling down on, no, policing as a system itself is corrupt. No. People are — you know, my uncle Johnny is a cop, and he’s great. And I’m like, I don’t care about your uncle Johnny being a nice man. Policing itself is corrupt. So, somebody putting somebody within a corrupt system corrupts them. Whether Johnny’s nice or good, he cannot fight against that system of that, like the blue wall of silence. The ways in which you are forced into being silent when horrible things are happening. I know cops. I’ve had to interact with them my — almost my entire adult life in various ways, right? In terms of, you know, either advocating for young people who are being harassed, or being in a space where I’ve actually had to interact with them in rooms where there’s been policy debates and things like that. And they’ll be the first to tell you that it is really impossible to get rid of bad cops. And so, that means it’s a systemic issue, not that it’s a personal issue.\u003cbr />\nSo, I feel like the lionization — and I don’t even know if it’s that. I just think like, putting the FBI on a pedestal is just an extension of the love of police in this country. And you see it with the way how unpopular in so many quarters Black Lives Matter is, and how uncomfortable white liberals are in dealing with the actual central tenet of white — of Black Lives Matter saying it is the whole system. It’s like, I can deal with the, you know, Darren Wilson being horrible. But you’re talking about, like, ending police? What? That doesn’t even make sense. It doesn’t compute. What I saw with what happened with Comey is that people were — there was a bifurcation. At least what I saw online were people were still pissed off at him for putting that letter out against Clinton. So, the Clinton support folks are still like, he, we’re not like — they’re not really defending Comey. But they are defending the institution of the FBI, and they want somebody on top that they want to see as a nonpolitical figure, as though anything in this country’s nonpolitical. Every friggin’ decision that gets made is political because all politics is is about power, to redistribute resources to the people who want to keep it versus the people who need it. That’s what politics is. That’s why I engage in politics, you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What can ordinary people who are living their lives do to contribute to the work that you’re doing or the issues that you are hammering on day in and day out in your work?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> I say the first thing people can do is find out who their prosecutor is in your local county. Who is the person with the discretion to lock up people? If you don’t know that person’s name, then it’s your civic duty to find out immediately, to find out what they actually have been doing. Go visit them. They’re down the street from your house. You have the right to go down here and say to them, “Hm, so I’m interested in knowing, like, are you tough on crime? Because if you are, you need to go. The next election, I’m gonna be there with my friends, my 2-7 — you know, my friends from bridge or whatever from the church, and we are gonna vote you out.” You have to talk at your local level. Criminal punishment decisions are made at the local level. I mean, at the county level often, right? And your jails are at the county level. So, pay attention to that. That’s like one thing you can do. It matters who you’ve elected as your district attorney. Find out who the judges are on the ballots that you get when you go and vote for like your senator and your congresspeople, and that’s the only thing you check off, that’s a dereliction of duty. Find out who the hell the judges are. Bar associations and other people always put out lists. Look and see who is going — you know, who is being recommended and why, and start voting against those people. As soon as they notice that the public is no longer down for stuff, trust me, they change. They’re politicians. They respond to pressure, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think that would be my second suggestion. And my third suggestion is, listen. It is really, really important not to allow people to demagogue you. Stop assuming that “safety” means imprisonment. It means more punishment. Start like getting the punishment mindset shifted in your mind so that when you see somebody who is other than you, that your fear factor that is like conditioned by all the messages you’ve gotten your entire life about who to be afraid of, like challenge that within yourself for real, and stop being at every point demagogued into locking up people, putting up walls, creating new borders. End that within yourself, and try to change people in your own circles’ ideas about who should — and stop — especially if you’re liberal and progressive — stop calling for people to be locked up every day. Oh, so-and-so’s a war criminal and they should go to prison! Listen. Everybody shouldn’t be going to prison. That’s the point. Stop playing into those ideas that every time something happens, your first inclination is to think about the prosecution and court system as the way to solve that problem. We all do it instinctively. I don’t, because I’ve like literally trained myself out of that over many, many years. But I see it all the time with friends of mine. The first thing that happens, jail the bankers. Really? You think that jailing some Goldman Sachs guys is what is gonna end capitalism? No, it’s not! And by the way, I don’t want Darren Wilson even locked up. Like, you know, like that’s hard for people to like fathom, because like, this is a killer cop. Of course he should go to jail. No, not even him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think we have to like reframe our thinking and get out of the criminal, like the punishment mindset that we have. It infects everything. It’s not just the criminal punishment system. It’s the way we treat our children. It’s the way we treat our community friends. It’s the way we look at young people in the streets and immediately assume that they’re doing something negative because they’re hanging out on the corner. It infects everything. So, I want people to change that, to, you know, change their mindset and think about people as — build new relationships with each other in order to be able to keep ourselves safe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mariame Kaba, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mariame Kaba is the founder of Project NIA, and a co-organizer of Survived and Punished.

I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City, and this is episode 18 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Anchor:\u003c/strong> Top Secret NSA report, first published on the website The Intercept, says hackers from Russian military intelligence were trying to access voter registration information days before the election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This week, the Intercept published a leaked Top Secret intelligence assessment from inside the National Security Agency. That document outlined alleged Russian cyberattacks that supposedly took place late last year on companies that make software that is used in some states as part of the U.S. election system. It also outlines other alleged attempts to target election and voting infrastructure inside the U.S. That document, which was dated just a month ago, May 5\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, 2017, is the most detailed account that has been published to date of the attacks that U.S. intelligence agencies claim that the Russian government directed during last year’s presidential campaign. According to the document, the hackers hoped to use their access to the software companies to “launch a voter registration-themed spear phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations.” The document is important because it outlines the NSA’s understanding of the mechanics of some of the phishing attempts that they say were part of the Russian effort to intrude in the U.S. electoral process. But we should note that this document does not provide any conclusive proof or evidence that these attacks actually succeeded, or that they had any impact whatsoever on the outcome of the presidential election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perhaps what’s most significant about this document is that the methods outlined by the NSA in this intelligence assessment, they’re not some high-end, ultra-spooky, scary new line of attack cooked up in a hacker factory inside of Russian intelligence. They’re basic phishing attacks. They have a few twists, but they are basic phishing attacks, the kind used by hackers around the world every single day. That these particular attacks did seem to penetrate at least one U.S. company that provides software used in the U.S. electoral process, that should be a wakeup call for how atrocious our voting system is in this country, and how susceptible it may be to an invasion by any number of actors, be they nation states or private hackers. This document really should spark a debate in this country or contribute to the debate in this country about the overall security of our votes and our elections in this country. It shouldn’t just be folded into the broader investigation into allegations about Russian intrusion. It’s much bigger than that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This document was provided to The Intercept completely anonymously. Within moments of The Intercept publishing this story on Monday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that they had arrested a 25-year-old government contractor. Her name? Reality Leigh Winner. And they arrested her on allegations that she transmitted defense information under the Espionage Act. The Intercept released a statement on Tuesday, and I’m gonna read it here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Although we have no knowledge of the identity of the person who provided us with the document, the U.S. government has told news organizations that Winner was the individual. While the FBI’s allegations against Winner have been made public through the release of an affidavit and search warrants, which were unsealed at the government’s request, it is important to keep in mind that these documents contain unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government’s agenda, and as such, warrant skepticism. Winner faces allegations that have not been proven. The same is true of the FBI’s claims about how it claimed to arrest Winner. We take this matter with the utmost seriousness. However, because of the continued investigation, we will make no further comment at this time.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That is the statement published by The Intercept at theintercept.com. Now, as listeners of this show know well, the Trump administration has made clear that it wants to aggressively shut down any leaks and go after leakers. In fact, Donald Trump reportedly told his, well, now fired FBI director James Comey that he wanted to have journalists who published leaked information arrested. Now, remember, under President Obama, the Espionage Act was used in record numbers to go after whistleblowers and leakers. The Trump administration, as some have noted, seems to be following suit. To discuss the Intercept story about this Top Secret NSA document, I’m joined now by The Intercept’s D.C. bureau chief, Ryan Grim. The story is titled “Top Secret NSA Report Details Russian Hacking Efforts Days Before 2016 Election.” Ryan, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ryan Grim:\u003c/strong> Ah, thanks for having me back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, in this story that you reported with three colleagues for The Intercept that’s based on this Top Secret National Security Agency document, lay out what is new or was previously unknown in this document.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> It adds detail, and it adds a flavor that wasn’t there before. So, Barack Obama, in December, at his end of the year press conference — by that time, they were acknowledging that they had observed some Russian efforts to tamper with the election back in the summer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> What I was concerned about in particular was making sure that that wasn’t compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting; affect the actual election process itself. And so, in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn’t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out, and there were gonna be some serious consequences if he didn’t. And in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> And so, what we now know is that this campaign that began in August continued, according to the NSA, into October and early November with spear phishing attacks on local election officials. It began in August, when Russian operatives directed by military intelligence launched a spear phishing campaign against this company called VR Systems. VR Systems handles a lot of the software for election officials in a variety of states, including Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and a handful of others. What they appeared to be looking for there was information so that they could cloak or spoof further spear phishing attempts, which they then launched at 122 local officials in October. Now, they can also — it’s not just a beachhead. It’s also kind of a beach that they could play around on too. If they could get into the registration roles, as the NSA suspects that they were able to, then there’s chaos that they could feasibly kind of wield from there as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The kinds of tactics that are described in the NSA document that were purportedly used by Russian military intelligence to try to go after this specific part of the technicalities of the electoral process or the voting process in this country, they don’t appear to be the ultra-sophisticated state-sponsored hacking tactics, but rather your kind of dyed-in-the-wool spear phishing operations —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That we see all the time against corporations, individuals, governments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Right. You know, a 14-year-old kid can pull off a spear phishing attack. It is the most basic attack that you can pull off. You know, you try to spoof an email. You say, “Hey buddy, you need more storage,” or “Somebody tried to hack into your emails. You need to change your password, so click here, type in your password, and bam, you’re finished.” And then as soon as you’ve given up your password, the hacker has access to your account. So, it is, on one level, extraordinarily basic. And that’s one thing that makes it so difficult to guard against, because it is so simple, because you are relying on the kind of credibility of the person on the other end. And it’s partly a numbers game, and that’s why a 14 year-old couldn’t do this at scale. You’d probably have to hit a bunch of different companies, and within that company, you have to hit a bunch of different employees. And eventually, you’re going to get somebody to click on this stuff, because it’s just human nature. And then once you’ve gotten the first company to click on it and you’ve gotten access to their stuff, then it becomes extremely difficult for the election officials not to get fooled as well, because the Microsoft Word doc that they were sending out to election officials said something like “New election day logistics,” or something along those lines. You think you’re getting an email from your contractor who runs your Election Day logistics, and they’re telling you, here are some new logistics that you need for Election Day. And so, you’re probably going to open that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But like you said, this is not some type of massively sophisticated hack that requires billions of dollars and mathematicians to put together. It’s just – it could have been a kind of freelancing unit within a particular subset of the military intelligence community that had kind of a mandate to create chaos. You don’t know exactly how it fit in to an overall geopolitical strategy or what they were doing. All the NSA says they can say is that they detected a variety of these intrusions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And of course, Senator Mark Warner, who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, responding to this report in The Intercept:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Mark Warner:\u003c/strong> None of these actions from the Russians stopped on Election Day. I don’t believe they got into changing actual voting outcomes. But if the extent of the attacks is much broader than has been reported so far — again, I’m trying to work through a declassification process. I think it’s terribly important that those states that were attacked in effect acknowledge that. And not, again, to point out maybe what was wrong, but to make sure that everybody is put on notice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I do think, though, that it’s important to remind people that this document represents the National Security Agency’s analysis of one particular set of operations allegedly perpetrated by Russia’s military intelligence, and it is not the raw data that provides the IP address and the fingerprints of the hackers that were doing this, correct?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Right. The raw intelligence is not here. There are no photos of particular Russian operatives who may have carried this out. There’s no particular people named. So, perhaps that is yet to come. But you’re right – if there was somebody who wanted to say, is this a smoking gun? No, this is the NSA saying that they saw a smoking gun. And they are not saying that the bullet hit. They’re just saying that the Russians pulled the trigger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, of course, you saw the interview that Megyn Kelly, formerly of Fox, now at NBC News, did recently with Vladimir Putin in Russia. And during that interview, Putin offered a theory of his own as Megyn Kelly pressed him on whether or not Russia was behind this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Vladimir Putin:\u003c/strong> What fingerprints or hoof prints or horn prints? What are you talking about? IP addresses. They can be invented, you know? There are a lot of specialists who can even make it so it comes from your home IP address, as if your three-year-old daughter carried out the attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, here you have Vladimir Putin basically saying anyone can spoof an IP address. And it’s interesting because I wonder if there’s any head of state in the world — certainly no one of his stature — that actually has talked about IP addresses in the way that Vladimir Putin did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But I wanted to ask you the kind of theory that he is floating that maybe this was an inside job by elements within the United States to try to point the finger at Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> I took that as kind of a wink wink, nod nod, you know. His kind of admission to Russia’s involvement in this has kind of gradually ratcheted up and up and up as the evidence has mounted that Russian operatives were behind this. And now he’s saying, well, maybe it was patriotically-minded Russians, or it was people in the United States who wanted to make it look like it was Russians. So, now he’s accounting for evidence out there that it appears to be Russia in order to kind of try to say, well, who knows? But to me, it seemed like a wink wink, like yes, we did it, and I’m okay with the world knowing that we did it because that’s a power move in and of itself. Now, none of this is to say that it influenced the election. And I think people conflate those two things a lot. What we’re talking about here are attempts to hack into the infrastructure to sow confusion. We don’t know necessarily whether or not it influenced the election, and there’s certainly no evidence that it did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Was there anything in this NSA document that you found surprising?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> You know, it’s always revealing to see it in black and white. But in a sense, no. I mean, this is the way that you would do this kind of a hack. If you were to sketch it out, you’d say, you know, how are we going to sow confusion in the U.S. election process? You’d start with a software company that manages registration roles that, you know, if you monkeyed around with that, then when people show up to vote and they can’t find their names or it says they’ve already voted, you know, that creates chaos and long lines, and election officials scrambling. And it only takes a few of those. Durham County only had a handful of those, and election officials had an emergency meeting, and moved over to paper ballots and extended voting, and it gets reported as this kind of emergency situation. So, that would be the first place you’d go. And then once you’ve – you know, once you can spoof somebody from a contractor, it’s much easier to get to the election officials themselves. So, on the one hand, no; but on other hand, it’s startling to see another country allegedly so brazenly attacking our system of peacefully transferring power from, you know, one faction to another.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ryan Grim, thank you very much for your insights and for being with us again on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RG:\u003c/strong> Yeah, thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ryan Grim is The Intercept’s D.C. bureau chief. And the story is called “Top Secret NSA Report Details Russian Hacking Efforts Days Before 2016 Election.” It’s available at theintercept.com. Coming up, we’re gonna talk to the woman the Democrats love to hate, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. And we’re gonna hear music from the singer-songwriter Damien Jurado. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back here on Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill. Hillary Clinton has certainly not disappeared from public life after losing the election to Donald Trump in November. In fact, she’s been remarkably visible of late, and has not shied away from sharing her views on why she believes she lost the election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hillary Clinton:\u003c/strong> Did we make mistakes? Of course we did. Did I make mistakes? Oh my gosh, yes. You know, you’ll read my confession and my request for absolution. But the reason why I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last ten days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hillary Clinton also cited allegations about Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HC:\u003c/strong> Every day that goes by, we learn more about some of the unprecedented interference, including from a foreign power whose leader is not a member of my fan club. And so, I think it is real. It is very much a part of the landscape politically and socially and economically.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, why Hillary Clinton lost the race is a subject of great contention in this country. Her supporters often chalk it up to some combination of Russian interference, hatred of the Clintons, hatred of her that goes back to her time as First Lady, sexism, the focus on her private email server when she was Secretary of State, the actions of FBI Director James Comey in the closing days of the election, and the role of third party candidates. And those include my next guest, the Green Party’s 2016 presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein. I reached out to Jill Stein this week after I watched the interview Sunday that NBC News broadcast of former Fox News Host turned NBC host Megyn Kelly with Russian president Vladimir Putin. During that interview, Megyn Kelly asked Putin about the allegations that Russian hackers sought to influence the U.S. election through hacking and other means. And she also asked Putin about a now quite infamous dinner that took place on December 10, 2015 in Moscow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MK:\u003c/strong> Did you know General Michael Flynn? He came over here for a dinner, a photo of which has been widely circulated in the American media. What was the nature of your relationship with him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VP:\u003c/strong> You and I, you and I personally have a much closer relationship than I had with Mr. Flynn. You and I met yesterday evening. You and I have been working together all day today, and now we’re meeting again. When I came to the event for our company, Russia Today, and sat down at the table, next to me, there was a gentleman sitting on one side. I made my speech, then we talked about some other stuff, and I got up and left. And then afterwards, I was told, “You know, that was an American gentleman. He was involved in some things. He used to be in the intelligence services.” That’s it. I didn’t even really talk to him. That’s the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Flynn. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, the dinner that Megyn Kelly was asking Vladimir Putin about was a gala sponsored by the Russian state television network RT. And Putin was its keynote speaker. The photo from that evening — I’m sure many of you, if not all of you, have seen it — was circulated all over the media and the web. And it shows Vladimir Putin next to General Michael Flynn at the dinner table. Flynn, of course, is very close to Donald Trump and was his National Security Advisor for a brief period until Trump reluctantly fired him. Flynn was paid upwards of $45,000 to give a speech that week in Russia at a conference sponsored by RT. Flynn now is under investigation for a range of issues extending from his meetings with Russian officials to his paid lobbying work for the Turkish government, to the dinner that night with Vladimir Putin. In response to requests from the U.S. Senate to testify, Michael Flynn has taken the Fifth Amendment, but he this week has just handed over hundreds of pages of documents to the Senate, so we’ll have to see what comes of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anyway, I bring all of this up because Jill Stein was also at that dinner with Flynn and Putin. In fact, she was seated at the exact same table. And it’s one of the many things I want to discuss with her. If you look around social media or you do some basic Googling, or if you watch MSNBC a whole lot, you will see a lot of vitriol aimed at Jill Stein when they talk about her at all. She’s been blamed directly for Clinton losing. She has been accused for taking votes away from the Democrats. Some people have even said she should be held responsible for Donald Trump pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. Jill Stein is a powerful woman for being the head of such a small political party, huh? Well, blasting her as a spoiler in the election is much of what you will hear about Jill Stein in the corporate media, if they even cover her at all. But she is a fierce activist for peace, the environment, workers’ rights. And she is also spearheading some of the efforts aimed at investigating the insecurity of the voting systems in the U.S., as well as pushing for presidential debates to include candidates that are not just Democrats and Republicans. Dr. Jill Stein, I want to welcome you to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jill Stein:\u003c/strong> It’s really great to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let’s just start with a very simple question. Why do you believe Donald Trump won?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Put it this way. This was one of the most toxic elections in our history, more influenced by big corporate money and corporate media than any ever before, with the most disliked and untrusted candidate that the American people have ever expressed an opinion about, in which most people who voted for Donald Trump, according to several polls, they were not for Donald Trump. They were against Hillary Clinton. So, I think that is a fairly, you know, critical factor. But I think there were many ringers, unfortunate circumstances that converged in this election, having to do with the fact, you know, what’s the unifier here? The unifier is that this election system is extremely screwed up. Nearly half of Americans chose not to vote. We deserve a better election system going forward. And that includes, of course, cybersecurity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I think that most of the mentions of your name during the — particularly during the closing months of the campaign came in the form of attacks of on you on the air, in print, from pundits, basically saying, both preemptively and then after the fact, you’re going to be responsible for Donald Trump winning the election. I want you to have a platform here to answer that question in an in-depth way, and not just, well, here’s this percentage of vote or that percentage of vote, but your overall view of why you push back against that, and what the truth of it is in your view.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> You know, most of that suppression, you know, the effort to suppress an opposition political voice, most of that is coming from a community that’s terribly afraid of Donald Trump, and for very good reasons. Donald Trump is extremely dangerous. He’s toxic. He is both a symptom of a political symptom in crisis, and he’s part of that crisis, making that crisis worse. So, I really understand that fear and that anguish and that sort of desperation. We’ve gotta find a reason. We’ve gotta blame somebody, and maybe that’ll fix it. That said, it’s really important to stand back and realize that the solution for a democracy on life support is not less democracy. Silencing political opposition is a very dangerous thing to do. That’s what they do in Russia, you know, which we are making such an effort not to be influenced by. We would be copycatting Russia to fully silence our political opposition. It’s pretty difficult right now as a political opponent to get on the ballot, to be heard in the media, to reach out the American public, who is desperate for a different kind of politics going forward. So, you know, the answer here is not to suppress independent, non-corporate voices, which in fact hold the solutions to what truly ails us. The solution is to change our voting system, which is a simple thing to do, and has been part — front and center, really — of our agenda from the start.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which part of the Constitution says that we can only have two parties in this country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Well, exactly —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, did you read that part?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> No. [Laughs] And in fact, you know, when we originated, we had no parties in this country. And the parties that have always been affiliated with our real progress forward have generally been independent third parties, whether you look at the abolition of slavery. So, you know, when people call these independent third parties spoilers, that’s exactly what the abolitionists were called. They were called spoilers for daring to confront a very toxic and dangerous political system that kept us stuck in a very dangerous status quo. So, you know, there’s no doubt we need to open up with this process. We need a political process that creates multi-partisan democracy. That’s really where democracies get their best shot at moving forward and solving our crises.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, clearly, very powerful forces in this country saw both you and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate, as very problematic for Hillary Clinton in particular. I mean, the Trump people were worried about a third party insurgent run that really would represent the kind of traditional GOP view of things. But in your case, you had Michelle Obama on the campaign trail saying —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Michelle Obama:\u003c/strong> And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don’t vote at all, then you are helping to elect Hillary’s opponent. Remember, it’s not about voting for the perfect candidate. There is no such person.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> President Obama himself said that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> If you vote for a third party candidate who’s got no chance to win, that’s a vote for Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ultimately, Bernie Sanders went on the tour, and he was dispatched to say that –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bernie Sanders:\u003c/strong> Before you cast a protest vote, because either Clinton or Trump will become president, think hard about it. Think about what the country looks like, and whether you’re comfortable of four years of a Trump presidency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And on election night, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC added up the percentage of your votes and Gary Johnson’s votes, and basically said this election of Donald Trump was made possible by Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rachel Maddow:\u003c/strong> If you vote for somebody who can’t win for president, it means that you don’t care who wins for president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Now, that’s what you call alternative math. We know that Kellyanne Conway uses alternative facts. Well, Rachel Maddow uses alternative math. And it’s based on the premise that if we only wish that pigs fly, pigs can fly. You know, so let’s wish that people who vote Green would vote Democratic if deprived of a candidate. But in fact, we have some math that tells us how people would vote according to what they said in exit polls. We know from exit polls, about 61 percent of Greens simply would not vote. Of the remaining 39 percent, well over a third of them — 36 percent, in fact — would have voted for Donald Trump. So, you can’t just take —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> 36 percent of?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Of my voters would have voted for Donald Trump, in the same way that we know Sanders voters were coming out of Trump’s campaign as well, and many of them went back to Trump’s campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Jill, I wanted to get your response to this story that was published by The Intercept this week based on this Top Secret NSA document outlining alleged Russian attempts to hack into companies that provide software used as part of the voting system in some states inside of the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> You know, with the caveat that I haven’t looked at the whole report yet, let’s forget for a moment whodunit. The critical thing here shows that our election system is in fact vulnerable. It’s vulnerable to security breaches. And we don’t know from this report — as I understand it, we don’t know if this security breach was successful. We don’t know what it did on the receiving end at the level of the voting machine. That is exactly why the machines need to be examined. Their software code needs to be examined to find out if in fact they were hacked, and what the consequences of that are. Now, one question that occurs to me is, we currently have lawsuits in two states. But this is obviously much broader than two states, and there may be reason for a much deeper examination of what’s gone on in this election with our voting machines. And obviously, we need to take steps to protect ourselves and our voting system going forward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There’s a pretty simple solution here, a drop-dead simple solution, which is that we shouldn’t be relying on hackable technology to start with We should have hand counted paper ballots, which is a simple technology — puts it in the light of day under community observation, essentially. So, there are many ways to solve this problem that get us to security. We could also improve the standards. Let’s start by having some standard for security in these machines. There are many ways to solve this problem, and it desperately needs attention. And I think, you know, the silver lining here is what the election integrity community has been screaming for. You know, here, we now have a big smoking gun.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, people often mention this, but I’ve never really heard anyone ask you with any length of time for the answer to actually explain it, so I want to do that right now. There’s this famous picture — well, it’s now become famous — of this dinner table where Vladimir Putin is seated next to General Michael Flynn, and you are sort of directly across from this at this sort of intimate roundtable. How did you end up at that table or in Russia at the same time as General Michael Flynn, from the beginning?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> All right. So, let me just start with the mythology that this was an intimate roundtable. There were like 11 people at the table. I think only eight are shown in the picture because of the angle it’s taken from. And actually, if you look closely, if you blow up the picture, you’ll see there’s a chair between Michael Flynn [laughs] and Putin, which was occupied by the head of RT. She happened to be introducing Putin at that moment. Putin and, I think three rather strapping men kind of stormed in just before Putin was to give a speech, so they really weren’t at the table for very long. Maybe five minutes, maybe 20, tops. Nobody introduced anybody to anybody. There was no translator. The Russians spoke Russian. The four people who spoke English spoke English. There was a guy sitting next to Flynn named Cyril Svoboda who was the deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic way back, and also the foreign minister, etc. He spoke both languages. And what I read afterwards was that he had briefly translated between Flynn and Putin, and it amounted to, “Hi, how you doing?” “Okay.” That was it. So, that was the great conversation. Nobody else talked to anybody across language barriers that I could see.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I assumed these were his bodyguards who came in with him. Turns out they weren’t his bodyguards. They were like his chief of staff and communications. But nobody cared to make introductions. This wasn’t intended to be a discussion of any sort. I spent just about the whole evening talking to the German former foreign minister sitting next to me, Willy Wimmer, and we had a very interesting conversation. But I think that was the only substantive conversation [laughs] that took place around that table.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And then Putin gets up to give his speech.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yup.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And then does he return to the table?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> No. Then they walk out. He was basically there to give a speech. This was not some kind of a dinner meeting. Nobody even met anybody. There were — I didn’t hear any words exchanged between English speakers and Russians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did Putin come around the table to say hi to everyone?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> So, I believe it was just before he made his speech, I think. He did a very perfunctory rapid-fire tour around the table. Didn’t say a word, just handshake, handshake, handshake, handshake, handshake. That was it. No names exchanged.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How much did you know about General Michael Flynn before you sat down there at that dinner?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Just about nothing. I mean the name sort of rang a bell. I thought it was interesting that there was a general at this dinner. So, he actually came over to me and introduced himself before we sat down.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He’s a very affable guy —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> He is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I will say, when you talk to him, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> I can see why people like him. He seems — he doesn’t give the air of being all full of himself like you would expect a general to be. He came over and introduced himself, and I gave him my elevator speech about the peace offensive, because that’s really why I was there. I was there to build international solidarity to the extent I could around a peace consensus to establish a weapons embargo and a freeze or seizing of the bank accounts of those countries that continue to fund terrorism, namely Saudi Arabia. That’s really why I was there. I had a very specific mission. And then also, you know, to broach nuclear weapons [laughs] and resuming nuclear disarmament talks, and maybe something about the climate and green energy while we’re at it. You know, I was there with basically my campaign agenda. There was nothing secretive about why I was there. And we put out press releases of my statements at the conference. In fact, are all on the web. They’re all very public. And —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, you know why I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> You know I gave Flynn my comment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> And it was clear this was not gonna go anywhere. The conversation was over before it started. That’s as much contact as I had with him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, when I saw that photo way before the Flynn/Trump stuff started up, because I followed Michael Flynn’s career for a very long time before he was really well-known in public, because he was General Stanley McChrystal’s chief of intelligence during the height of the Joint Special Operations Command’s kill capture operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, you know, Flynn was a part of these elite covert operations that — where the U.S. Special Ops forces were just killing their way across Iraq and also running their own parallel detention and interrogation programs. So, my initial, you know, view of this was, my God, they’re letting –—like, the U.S. government is allowing General Michael Flynn to sit at a table with Putin and Jill Stein? Like, from one end, you have — why would they put somebody with such knowledge about where bodies are buried, so to speak, next to Putin, and also, why would Flynn agree to sit at a table with Jill Stein, who has made abundantly clear that his — basically his life’s work is something that she stands in opposition to on a policy level? I’m just saying, like that was my — that was my first —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> My first view of it was like, this is an insane group of people to have collected at a table together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Well, I think that reflects the reality that we were not in fact at the table together. You know, [laughs] we were physically at the same table, but, you know, you’ve gotta know that there was this really incredible show that was going on that included the Russian Chorus and an opera singer, and there was just nonstop entertainment. There was a lot of volume. And there was no talk across the table. And it was clearly not intended to be a discussion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What did you eat?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Um. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You’re a vegetarian, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> I am a vegetarian, yes. Well, actually, I’m a fish-eating vegetarian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You’re a pescetarian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yes. There was — you know, there were lots of great vegetable dishes and salad, so I was able to make my way around.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Come on, Jill. You’ve gotta dish with us here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Oh, I know. I know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Caviar?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Not to ask if you ate caviar. Was there caviar present?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Not that I was aware of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein\u003c/strong>: If there was, I probably would have eaten it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Bad Russians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> But I didn’t see any. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And your intent in going there was not just to go to this dinner. There was a broader context.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yes, absolutely. I mean the dinner had absolutely no relevance to my trip.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And so, why were you — why were you there at the time?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> I was there because RT was hosting this conference as its tenth anniversary. And also, the Paris Climate Summit was happening. So, I thought, well, as long as I’m going to the Paris Summit, I might as well also go see if I can talk to the Russians, because we need to talk to each other. In the words of John F. Kennedy —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John F. Kennedy:\u003c/strong> We shall never negotiate out of fear. And we shall never fear to negotiate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> I sort of came of age during the Cold War, when physicians were making a great effort to talk to Russians in order to achieve nuclear weapons treaties. And we were successful. And that was deeply ingrained in me during my training, that it’s really important to talk to people, and that nuclear weapons are a consummate health issue. All the other health stuff doesn’t matter, you know, if the nuclear weapons are gonna go off. So, you know, I take that as a very serious personal and political responsibility. So, to not go to Russia at a time when all hell is breaking loose, to not go and bring the message of the Greens, which is a very important international message of peace — it’s a very different paradigm. And it’s a paradigm that needs to be resurrected and looked at. So, I was very interested to go have that conversation. There were gonna be media from all over the world, you know, including China’s and India’s, as well as talk to people. There were many peace advocates who were there — Ray McGovern, Rocky Anderson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, undercover informant —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Who ran for the Justice Party.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Former CIA analyst —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Jesse Ventura, for that matter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Former pro wrestler, and this is like a quiz here. And former governor of Minnesota, current RT host with his own show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yes. Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There’s — Flynn, of course, we now know was paid a pretty substantial — well, by most American standards in terms of working people, a pretty substantial amount of money to appear there. Did they pay you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> No, they did not offer to pay me. They did offer to pay my way, and I said no thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, let me get this straight, because I’ve seen people erroneous —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, you’re saying they did not pay your transportation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> I would not accept money for transportation. They did not pay my hotel fare either at a Russian state hotel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did you have any interaction with Flynn at all at the conference, or was he just there to do that event at the dinner?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> He was actually there to give a talk at the conference. And I was actually in the room, but I was busy preparing my remarks [laughs], so I did not actually listen to what he had to say.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is your assessment based on what you understand of the issue here with Russia? Do you think that it’s real? Do you think it’s being handled in a serious enough way by the Republicans? And what do you make of what the emerging Democratic strategy on this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> You know, so there’s this question of cyber interference. And then there’s this question of, you know, was there a propaganda campaign that was somehow not the usual course of affairs? Because we live in an ocean of propaganda campaigns. So, was there something different about this propaganda campaign? And then the third question is, what’s the nature of Trump’s engagements with Russia, whether it’s the government, or the oligarchs, or the mafia, or the gangsters? Each of those are very important questions that are, you know, under scrutiny right now. And I think time is gonna tell, but just a brief comment about each of those issues. About cyber interference, we know that cyber interference is today’s reality. It’s kind of inconceivable that the Russians would not be probing cyber weaknesses, just like the U.S. is probing and looking for cyber weaknesses, including in our own corporations, where our collection of those cyber weaknesses just led to this crisis around the ransomware.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, who’s doing it more? I don’t know. And maybe the Russians are far worse on this. But I don’t know that. But the solution to it is not to go to war, and it’s not to beat the war drums. The solution is to ensure that we have cybersecurity. And for example, on our voting machines, we don’t have cybersecurity. That’s part of why I ran a recount campaign, so that we could actually elevate these issues and have a debate about it. And this is debate is not over, by the way. Maybe that’s another discussion. But we have two active lawsuits right now, so this is still not done. Our hope is to basically end the use of these very vulnerable, tamper-prone, error-prone electronic voting machines.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It seems like there’s a “there” there, you know — that there are serious questions that need to be answered by people in Trump’s immediate political circle about their contacts. There are questions about whether or not the Russians were successful in their cyber attacks against the U.S., whether it’s phishing stuff with the DNC and other entities, or any direct attacks that they may have attempted on voting machines or on the voting process. But we haven’t seen concrete evidence. And a lot of Democrats and liberal pundits really seem to be fanning the flames of Cold War thinking again, and in fact, using the hammer and sickle on their signs at these rallies, and Comrade Trump. And I think that that’s not just sort of not funny humor, but it’s a dangerous mentality. And I don’t think it’s just something that we should kind of laugh off as liberals being dumb. I think there’s a very belligerent tone coming from very powerful Democrats in this country, and that concerns me. And I’m wondering what you think about the way the Democrats have approached that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so, I don’t know if you’ve seen any of the tweets that have gone out about me and my campaign and Green voters, some of them to Sanders voters as well. You know, there’s an extremely mean-spirited, nasty, rather vicious and violent campaign out there, which is not a healthy thing, from Rachel Maddow to Bill Maher, who just hit an all-new low, joking about the N-word.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill Maher:\u003c/strong> So, you think Jill Stein is gonna be president? Look me in the eye and tell me that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dr. Cornel West:\u003c/strong> We shall see. But it’s gonna be tough.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Stein:\u003c/strong> Keith Olbermann, who says it’s largely your fault, you imbecile. That is Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris treaty. I didn’t know I was that powerful, that that’s my responsibility. Kurt Eichenwald, saying he had to restrain himself from punching somebody out in the airport who he learned had voted for me. You know, I mean, it’s this kind of just really violent, vile sentiments that are out there. You know, this is neo-McCarthyism. This is the new Cold War. This is incredible intolerance that doesn’t move us forward. And it’s just — it’s wrong. It’s wrong about the spoiling\u003cstrong>,\u003c/strong> because in fact, if you actually do the math here, you know, the numbers don’t add up in any state. Not in any state, if you account for the fact that most of our voters, Green voters, would not have voted, and of those who voted, more than one-third would have voted for Trump, etc. So, it’s not true in a single state that my staying home would have changed things. It’s also not true that silencing political opposition is somehow gonna solve this problem of this crisis in our democracy and the surge towards fascism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, also, like, we don’t have a monarchy in this country, or we’re not supposed to. Like, the Bushes and the Clintons, these aren’t royal families that have a right to the throne. And I do think that there was a great deal of attitude about that in general from the Democratic Party about Hillary Clinton, like it’s her turn to be president. And what I found perhaps most ironic about some of the attacks against you, a line where it’s like, if you voted for the Green Party, you engaged in, you know, de facto misogyny. Point out the fact that the Green Party’s nominee was in fact a woman, and that the vice presidential candidate was an African American —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein.\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It, like, defies common sense or logic or just kind of facts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Exactly. This is not rational thinking. This is like the expression of people who are really distraught and angry and pissed off, and looking for any way to express it. But it’s really important for us to, I think, keep our eyes on the prize, maintain our civility. Let’s create the democracy that enables us to choose the candidates that we want. We shouldn’t be forced into this straitjacket in which the majority of Trump voters — I can’t stress this often enough — the majority of Trump voters were voting against Hillary and the Clintons. So, we need a greater diversity of political choices. We’re not gonna solve this by silencing political opposition. That’s a very dangerous thing to do. And because of the way that the neo-McCarthyism is hooked up with the new Cold War and the anti-Russia surge, this is a very dangerous moment. We have our nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. And, you know, we have surrounded Russia with nuclear weapons and missiles over the last couple of decades. Russia’s been invaded a few times over the course of history, whether it was Napoleon or the Germans, so they’re a little bit touchy about missiles moving to their borders in the same way that we were pretty touchy about missiles moving into Cuba. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse on steroids. In fact, on crack. This is a very dangerous moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you believe that Trump makes it through a full term as president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> His days are numbered.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. So, his days are numbered for what reason?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Stein:\u003c/strong> Because daylight is now being shined on him. What we know is his massive liability are these 500 businesses that he has around the world, and these entanglements. And these entanglements are already coming back to bite him. His appointment, for example, of Wilbur Ross to Commerce, who’s a part of this bank in Cypress that launders Russian money, that includes among its principals the guy that bought Trump’s house at twice the cost that Trump had paid for it just a few years before. There’s some very funny stuff going on here. Funny rotten stinkin’ stuff related to Russian money laundering, Russian gangsters, who knows what? But there’s no way Trump is gonna be able to keep this secret. And his efforts to suppress and to interfere with an FBI investigation, which he admitted was his reason for firing Comey — there’s no way he’s gonna be able to stop this investigation from going forward. He could well quit, but I think he will be forced to quit by daylight that is being shined on him. If he quits, put it this way, he’s gonna leave the presidency under the weight of his own massive corruption.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Impeachment is necessary, but it may not get to that, because he’s gonna become such a liability to the Republicans in the House seeking reelection that they’re gonna start flipping. I mean people are lawyering up all over the place right now. And I think his support in Congress is gonna diminish, and the American people are going to be very outraged. The people of South Korea recently impeached their president for corruption that I think looks like peanuts, peanuts if even compared to what we’re looking at with Donald Trump. So, I think there is a realistic possibility of impeachment based on corruption. Impeachment is necessary, but it’s not sufficient. We need a peaceful revolution at the ballot box.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Dr. Jill Stein, Green Party presidential candidate, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J.

Damien is about to embark on an incredibly ambitious tour, in which he plans to stop in all 50 states in the union, each and every one. The first stops will be Ohio and Indiana, but the rest of the states, he’s gonna determine that by a completely random lottery. Imagine 50 little balls with the name of each state written on them colliding together in a bottle, drawn arbitrarily. So, if Damien Jurado happens to draw New Hampshire and then Hawaii, that’s the order he’s going. Here is Damien Jurado.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Damien Jurado:\u003c/strong> The idea really came from a very long and continuous thought that I have been having probably since living in a small town myself growing up on the coast of Washington in the Grays Harbor area. Man, I was like 12, 13 years old when I discovered hardcore and punk rock music. I was watching a USA Network show called “Night Flight.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Only on Night Flight can you see takeoffs to the latest trends in today’s music, fantastic feature films, video profiles, new sounds, heavy metal heroes, directions in jazz . . .\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJ:\u003c/strong> And they showed this documentary called “Another State of Mind.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Punks are misunderstood. Most people, when they think of punks, they think of violent freaks rolling around in glass, beating each other up. When I think about punk, I think of the power. I think of the energy. I think of the possibilities for change. That’s what punk’s all about, change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJ:\u003c/strong> It was about Social Distortion touring across America. And they were playing these, like, churches and VFW halls. And it was a music that was really, I felt like, talking to me, you know? Even though I lived in the middle of nowhere, I felt like it was still talking to me. There was still that anger and aggression to it and restlessness about it that I was really, really into. But, you know, no bands were coming out to the Grays Harbor area, and any show I had to go see was far away in Seattle. You know, that’s kind of partly where I think this sort of thing stems from, for me, anyways. I just thought there’s more of America that’s out there besides the major cities or major markets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“The Song of the Grand Coulee Dam (Way up in that Northwest),” Woody Guthrie]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Way up in the northwest land of the skies\u003cbr />\nColumbia River’s headwaters rise.\u003cbr />\nMountain to mountain all covered with snows,\u003cbr />\nI’ll follow that River wherever she goes\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJ:\u003c/strong> How Woody Guthrie fits in for me is that he’s an American. I hate the word “icon,” but he is very iconic. There’s a — he carries a lot of symbolism to him, and his name, and what he did to his music. I mean, the guy wrote anthems. I mean, these weren’t just songs, you know. These were anthems that I feel like defined who we were as people. And I mean to say that no matter what side of the aisle politically you’re falling or on standing on, that I think that Woody Guthrie was directly in the middle of that. For the most part, he really just did it his way, the way he wanted to. And most of the shows that he was doing, they were in people’s living rooms, they were in labor camps, they were on picket lines. He wasn’t playing, like, Carnegie Hall, you know? [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was very hard for me for a band to ever influence the way I voted. No band ever made me want to vote one way or another. Maybe you can call it my punk background or roots. I’ve never really relied on the government anyways, you know? So, to be let down by a political system, whether it be this administration or the administrations before this one, I don’t put my faith into it. I put my faith into my community. If there is someone in need on my block, okay, where I live, or two blocks or three blocks or five blocks from me, okay, I feel that it’s my responsibility. I feel that it’s the responsibility of those around me to come to the aid of that person in need. Because I know — I know and history has shown, the government and even local governments are not gonna do squat about it, I don’t think. I have yet to really see it, you know? It’s really about, I think for me, the human condition. I think politics has its place, there’s no doubt about it. But for me, I’m more concerned about, as they call, “us down here.” [Laughs] You know? I’m very much more focused on the “us down here,” so. I have to go where I feel my convictions lead me, which is to the smaller markets, because there are people there. There are people there. There are people that love music, and why the heck are we overlooking that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is Damien Jurado with “Kola.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Kola,” Damien Jurado]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When I look back upon my time\u003cbr />\nAnd the snapshots of my life\u003cbr />\nYou will not be surprised\u003cbr />\nSee your name across my smile\u003cbr />\nSee your name across my smile\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I will remember you\u003cbr />\nI will remember you\u003cbr />\nI will remember you\u003cbr />\nThe way you are right now\u003cbr />\nThe way you are right now\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When I first came into view\u003cbr />\nI was older than you knew\u003cbr />\nAlways going out of tune\u003cbr />\nAny time you&#8217;d leave the room\u003cbr />\nAny time you&#8217;d leave the room\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I will remember you\u003cbr />\nI will remember you\u003cbr />\nI will remember you\u003cbr />\nThe way you are right now\u003cbr />\nThe way you are right now\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When I look back upon my time\u003cbr />\nAnd the snapshots of my life\u003cbr />\nYou will not be surprised\u003cbr />\nSee your name across my smile\u003cbr />\nSee your name across my smile\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I will remember you\u003cbr />\nI will remember you\u003cbr />\nI will remember you\u003cbr />\nAnd the way you are right now\u003cbr />\nThe way you are right now\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJ:\u003c/strong> My name is Damien Jurado.

Very good. Thank you all very much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump has made crystal clear, in his brief time as the President of the United States, that he has a great affinity for strong men and for unquestioned loyalty of those who work for him. I was reflecting on all of this as I punished myself this week by watching the full 11-minute clip of Donald Trump presiding over the first official meeting of his cabinet. Each member of the Trump all-star team seemed intent on outdoing the others in the praise that they heaped on Trump. In a way, it sort of reminded me of watching state TV broadcasts in Iraq when I was reporting from Baghdad back when Saddam Hussein was in power. In that case, you had the images of the cabinet, Saddam’s council praising him, saluting him, and you almost never would hear any audio in the room. The announcers would say, oh, everyone praise Saddam Hussein for his brilliant strategic moves. And then there was this bizarre soothing elevator music that would play under the whole thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Iraqi state television music]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Actually, I have little doubt that Trump would have liked Saddam Hussein. He would have probably welcomed him to Mar-a-Lago. Eric and Don Jr., they surely would have enjoyed massacring animals with Uday and Qusay Hussein. A few weeks ago, when Trump was mixing and mingling with other despots, as well as unelected kings and princes in Saudi Arabia at his big summit, Trump fit in perfectly. And the Saudis emerged as the big winners of that little summit. And as Trump returned to the U.S., a major scandal hit the Gulf. And it centered around the strategically important nation of Qatar. This crisis began when Qatari media outlets reported on comments purportedly made by Qatar’s Emir, in which he criticized Donald Trump and praised Iran as a force for stability. Now, that is about as far off message as Trump and the Saudis would want their supposed allies to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For its part, Qatar claimed its websites were hacked, and that this was outside influence, and these were lies, and the emir never said those things. But all of that was called into doubt when it was pointed out that some of the comments that the emir made have been broadcast, and Qatar didn’t attempt to disown them then. And so, who knows? Saudi Arabia, ever the hypocritical opportunist, seizes the moment, and they cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar. The reason that the Saudis cited? Qatar supports terrorist groups. That’s very rich, coming from the Saudis. Egypt, then, with its dictator, el-Sisi, they quickly followed suit. And before long, country after country after country was jumping onboard the anti-Qatar bandwagon. Panic gripped many citizen of Qatar, and people began rushing to grocery stores, buying up food and other goods, fearing that the country could be isolated and sanctioned, particularly if the United States then aggressively backed the Saudi position.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What happened here was that the Saudis shaped a narrative that had at its center the idea that Qatar is the sole mastermind of support from the Gulf for terrorism and radical movements in a variety of countries. Now, that narrative is laughable on this front. It’s laughable to anyone who knows anything about the region and all of its players, and anything about Saudi Arabia, right? Well, at least one person seemed to have bought the Saudi line hook, line, and sinker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> The nation of Qatar unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level. They have to end that funding, and its extremist ideology in terms of funding.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, one factor in this whole situation with Qatar that’s sort of being debated right now, although I don’t really think it’s a debate, is whether Trump actually knew that U.S. Central Command and upwards of 10,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Qatar. It’s unclear if Trump knew what role U.S. Central Command plays in U.S. wars or the facility inside of Qatar. There’s a lot of evidence suggesting that Trump literally had no idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To make sense of this situation, I’m joined now by two very sharp students of this region. Sherine Tadros is a former war reporter and a long-time correspondent for Al Jazeera English. You may not remember her name, but if you watched Al Jazeera English during the fall of Hosni Mubarak, she was basically reporting 24/7 on TV about the events there, an incredibly brave journalist. Sherine is now the representative to the United Nations in New York of the human rights group Amnesty International. We are also joined by Mehdi Hasan, who is the host of the excellent show UpFront on Al Jazeera English, and he’s also a columnist for The Intercept. Qatar, of course, owns Al Jazeera. Mehdi Hasan, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mehdi Hasan:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sherine Tadros, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sherine Tadros:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to ask both of you this question, but I want to begin with you, Sherine, because you’re directly working on this issue right now on behalf of Amnesty International. What the hell is going on between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and what is the U.S. role? I think a lot of even very well informed foreign policy observers and international relations observers are sort of baffled by what’s going on. So, what is going on right now with Qatar?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> I mean, it is baffling, I think, because of the speed of things. To look back in history, there has always been — I mean, let’s say post the independence of Qatar in 1971 — there has always been this animosity, this really strong animosity between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. And then there’s been this competition between them, with Saudi pretty much winning that competition most of the time, seeing as though Qatar is this tiny Gulf state that, you know, is the size of Connecticut.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What are they competing over?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> They’re competing over influence, number one, more than anything else. You know, Qatar really wants to be relevant. And in a very similar way, I think, to how Iran has always felt, that it wants that sort of regional relevance. And I think that’s what had gravitated the two towards each other. But Saudi Arabia being bigger, being more strategic, having more oil, and being a stronger ally of the United States, always managed to get that little bit ahead until the Arab Spring. And then what we saw was Saudi Arabia was suddenly backing the horse that was drowning. And there was Qatar, the voice of the voiceless, championing this sort of underdog of the Muslim Brotherhood, whether it be in Tunisia or whether it be in Egypt and Syria, so on. And that, of course, as we all know how that story ended or is ending, blew up. And I think since then, there’s been a real problem in Qatar in trying to think, how do we move this forward?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I mean, what we saw happen was that the leader of Qatar started speaking about the closeness to Iran and the importance of Iran in the region. Various emails were hacked into, and there were leaks basically painting the Qatari leader as someone who was very close to these Iranian groups, and what others would consider terrorist organizations like Hamas. What really happened is that Saudi Arabia took advantage of that and decided very abruptly to cut ties. And then another eight countries followed suit. And what we found was this diplomatic but also economic ban, isolation, of Qatar, whereby all of these countries, be it Egypt, Bahrain, and even now Maldives and Mauritius have joined in, and of course Saudi Arabia, cutting ties with Qatar, not allowing their planes to fly over their air space, saying that their nationals have two weeks to get out of these nine countries and go back to Qatar. I mean, real serious effects. I mean, the world freaks out when someone recalls an ambassador from a country. And these people overnight sort of completely cut Qatar off. So, you know, it has huge economic and trade ramifications, and I think that the economists are still reeling from what this may mean. And but it really has consequences on people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Mehdi, we should say that in fairness to our listeners, Mehdi does in fact work for Al Jazeera as well as The Intercept. But I want to ask you about this disconnect between the public statements of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and those then, literally a day later, of Donald Trump as he stood alongside the president of Romania, where you had Tillerson basically responding to this Qatar crisis —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RT:\u003c/strong> We call on Qatar to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors. Qatar has a history of supporting groups that have spanned the spectrum of political expression, from activism to violence. We call on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt to ease the blockade against Qatar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>And then the next day…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT: \u003c/strong>Nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behavior. So, we had a decision to make. Do we take the easy road, or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, what’s going on there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Jeremy, Donald Trump doesn’t do de-escalation. Donald Trump does escalation. He doesn’t put out fires. He starts fires. And many would argue, just to add to Sherine’s excellent analysis, that a lot of this happened so quickly because of Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia, where there’s a lot of talk that he signed Saudi Arabia’s blank check. They didn’t do this, Saudi Arabia. They didn’t make this major move against another U.S. ally, Qatar, without getting clearance from the President of the United States. And when Trump told the Saudis, “Yeah, fine, do what you want to Qatar,” maybe he didn’t know that CENTCOM is based in Qatar, that one of the biggest U.S. military bases in the world is in Qatar, that 10,000 U.S. troops are in Qatar. And then it turns out that MSNBC, reporting late last week, that yes, Trump was not aware that there are U.S. forces stationed in Qatar, which just goes to show how reckless and irresponsible a president he is. I mean, whatever your views of Saudi and Qatar, and many would say a plague on both their houses, I’m sure. Many of your listeners would say, well, why should we care about Gulf states getting into a spat with each other? The irony of a U.S. president who is leading, supposedly leading a war against ISIS, which is being coordinated and managed out of CENTCOM in Qatar, which is bizarre.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And as is so often the case, I kind of throw up my hands at the U.S. media, none of whom are asking the obvious question to Trump, which is if Qatar is a terrorist nation or a terrorist-funding nation, why are there 10,000 U.S. troops based in that terrorist nation, that terrorist-supporting nation? Do you see a contradiction, Mr. President? Because the rest of the world does.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sherine, on Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia — we’ve talked about this big arms deal that he is running around bragging about, he made this great deal to sell the Saudis weapons that are overwhelmingly going to be used in this campaign to destroy Yemen. I mean, let’s just be clear about what it is there. But as you work at the United Nations right now, and you’re representing Amnesty International, what are the premiere concerns about the Trump administration’s emerging policies, the message that’s being sent by the most powerful institution in the United States, the White House, to the Arab and Muslim world about U.S. priorities as it relates to Trump’s relationship with the Saudis, the situation with Qatar? What are the big things that Amnesty International’s concerned about right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> I mean, I tell you, from a practical point of view, once of the biggest problems we have is that there’s very little directives coming from the White House. I mean, it’s very ad hoc. So, you sit in a room with, you know, U.S. experts of the mission, and there are so many different subjects on which they don’t have any information or directive on, whether it be South Sudan or Burundi. And that’s a real problem because Trump has really shaken up the world order like that. The fact is that especially at the UN, within that community, people wait for what the U.S. position is before they make a move. And so, there’s a real paralysis right now in terms of many subjects.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I think when it comes to Yemen, certainly, the U.S. support of Saudi has been staggering and really harmful — harmful for the people of Yemen directly. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump can stand in Saudi Arabia and sort of talk about Iran spreading terrorism, you know, on maybe the second day after they had elections in Iran. He doesn’t see the irony of what he’s saying, and sort of the hypocrisy of what he’s doing? And that’s what’s incredible about this whole thing. I mean, this is all about spreading terrorism and supporting terrorist organizations, and this is Saudi taking the sort of moral lead? And it’s just — it’s amazing to me that more isn’t made out of that deep hypocrisy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How did Qatar become the player that it is today, and what is the actual agenda of the rulers of Qatar?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> I mean, I’d really say — and this is really from living in Qatar for many years — it’s often very confusing, that Qatari leaders imagine themselves with a sort of a more secular Dubai-style country. And there was a big backlash against that when they tried to create that. So, one small example is the Pearl Islands. The Pearl Islands, they created in Doha. They were very proud of them. They sat, you know, we’re gonna allow alcohol on these islands. We’re gonna allow expats to buy property. They were really excited about it. I think that maybe, I don’t know, a few weeks after the opened up pubs and bars and whatever, someone got drunk, made a scene. They ended up just shutting the whole thing down. And it’ really sort of indicative to me about the schizophrenia of this country and the leaders, because there’s something that they want to be, which is seen as progressive world leaders, influential. But then there’s what the population is, which is deeply conservative and traditional. So, I think that its real influence came with Al Jazeera and with the Arab Spring.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. I mean, it’s basically a TV network and very convenient real estate for the most powerful military in the world with a flag.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> Yeah. The main thing is that, you know, their struggle for influence in the region has been a big thing. And I think that they made this decision, that we can compete with the U.S. and Saudi for the sort of influence — so, what we’ll do is we’ll back the other side. We’ll back the Muslim Brotherhood, you know, and these sort of group. And that paid off in 2011. It did not pay off shortly after.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sherine, you and I both as journalists spent quite a bit of time in Yemen. And my heart just bleeds when I see the lack of coverage or concern about what is happening to that nation right now. And you just have a horrifying, on the one hand, humanitarian crisis, and then on the other hand, a merciless military campaign, while there’s also ground fighting in the country. Why is this happening right now? What is the Saudi agenda, and why is the United States so aggressively supporting it under Mr. Transformative Constitutional Law Professor and Mr. Orange Reality TV Host?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> I think what I would like listeners to really take away from what’s going on in Yemen, at the end of the day, it’s the Arab world’s richest country, waging a devastating war on the Arab world’s poorest country. It is the biggest humanitarian catastrophe we have today. It’s even beyond what’s happening in Syria in terms of humanitarian consequences. The Saudis have blocked access of humanitarian aid. They don’t allow human rights organization or journalists on UN flights. That’s pretty much what the Saudi directive has been to the UN. So, there’s a dearth in actually being able to know what’s going on and record human rights violations on the ground. So, any sort of accountability is becoming less and less likely by the day. But the thing that troubles a lot of people is that this is a senseless war. War is always devastating and senseless, honestly. No one can look at Syria and say, you know, that makes sense. But there’s some sort of strategic analysis that you can do about how we got to that point, you know, with Iran and Syria and so on. I think when you look at Saudi, it’s really not — I struggle to really understand what Saudi’s agenda is there. And this is the case with a lot of people, and this is why it’s been so difficult to negotiate with the Saudis, because it’s not clear what their end game is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I’m not sure they know. And I don’t think we should underestimate the fact that we have a Saudi defense minister who is running the show that isn’t completely logical in his decision-making. And a lot of it is about pride, and the fact that they got themselves into this war at a time when they were trying to show themselves as these new sort of Saudi rulers, asserting their authority. And now, I wonder whether they just don’t know how to get themselves out of this war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mehdi Hasan, your analysis of the Saudi agenda, not just in Yemen, but on a global stage right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Just to pick up on Sherine’s last point about Mohammed bin Salman and BS, the kind of rising star of the Saudi police elite who wants to be king as soon as possible. Clearly, his role in this can’t be overstated. I think he thought this would be a quick, easy war, and the Saudis would inflict a beating on an Iranian proxy in a very poor nearby country, and it hasn’t worked out that way. In fact, it’s been self-destructive in so many ways, because the Houthis are probably more powerful than they were before. The Iranian connection to the Houthis is probably more solid than it was before. And all of these extremist groups, al-Qaeda et al., are way more powerful in Yemen than they were before. In terms of global agenda — I think to go back to the start of the conversation and the mention of the Arab Spring — Saudi Arabia was on the wrong side of the Arab Spring, obviously, because it did not want to see its allies being toppled in this way. It did not want to see a democratic upsurge across the region, given it is the most undemocratic country in the region.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I interviewed the ambassador to the United Nation, Ambassador al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador, about 18 months ago. And I asked him why he supported the uprising in Syria when they didn’t support the uprisings anywhere else, and they don’t support democracy in Saudi Arabia, even though they want to — they claim to want democracy in Syria. So, there’s a huge contradiction, obviously, at the heart of the Saudi regional agenda. I think in terms of global terms, in terms of the relationship with the U.S. Jeremy, you saw the trip that Trump made there. It’s a made match in heaven. These guys love each other. There’s a lot in common between the Trump family and the Saudi ruling family. There’s a reason why there was so much bling on display and huge photos of Trump and the King Salman all across Riyadh during that trip. They see in the U.S. president a natural ally, someone who thinks and behaves as they do, someone they can do business with in a way they thought they couldn’t with Obama, even though Obama sold them a fair amount of weapons. And therefore, they see an opportunity now to reassert themselves in perhaps a way they thought they couldn’t back in 2011-12.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we wrap up, you both are from Britain, and I wanted to get your reaction to the results of last week’s elections there. Much of the world was stunned when Jeremy Corbyn led the Labour Party within inches of regaining power at 10 Downing Street, and forced Theresa May to scramble in an attempt to build a governing coalition of the heinous. Mehdi, you wrote an excellent column on this for The Intercept called “Jeremy Corbyn is leading the Left out of the Wilderness and Toward Power.” What’s the takeaway from this election?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> I think what’s hugely significant is that the result wasn’t what everyone thought it would be. Yes, Theresa May has returned to office, just about — has scraped back into office. As we speak, Jeremy, there are negotiations going on in London between her and a small northern Irish Protestant Unionist Party called the DUP, the Democratic Unionist Party, to try and stay in office because she doesn’t have a majority, Jeremy. She’s gonna be forming a minority government. And that was the real shock. She was supposed to come back with this landslide victory, this huge majority. She was supposed to be the second coming of Margaret Thatcher, the new Iron Lady on the right. She would destroy the Labour Party for a generation. She was up against the worst leader you could ever imagine, a far left, a bearded, 68-year-old guy who nobody liked, has no friends, his own party hate him. It would be a cakewalk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Jeremy, it wasn’t a cakewalk. In fact, she lost the majority, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party — yes, they didn’t win the election. We must remember that, sadly, in the views of many. But they picked up votes. In fact, Jeremy, they won more votes — the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn won more votes than any Labour leader in almost 50 years, apart from Tony Blair in those famous landslides of 1997 and 2001. In fact, he put on more votes. He increased the Labour vote by more than any other leader since Clement Attlee in 1945. So, a huge achievement for a guy who was supposed to be a loser.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jeremy Corbyn has spoken very openly in his critique of the Saudis, of various U.S. wars that are backed by Gulf nations, in a way that you would never hear anything resembling a viable candidate in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Corbyn:\u003c/strong> Our democratic values must be maintained. We must resist Islamophobia and division. And yes, we do need to have some difficult conversations, starting with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states who have funded and fueled extremist ideology — Theresa May suppressing a report into the foreign funding of extremist groups. We have to get serious about cutting off their funding to these terror networks, including ISIS here and in the Middle East. [Crowd clapping]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What does that tell you about Britain’s relationship with these corrupt Gulf monarchies and with the United States, that someone like Corbyn has gotten so close to actually become prime minister, and may one day become prime minister?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ST:\u003c/strong> I think what it shows is that there’s a real divide between what the British public think about the relationship and the closeness between the UK and Saudi Arabia, and what Number 10, what Downing Street thinks. Because there is this huge gulf. There is, on the one hand, we have these protests against Saudi Arabia, and there is an increasing sort of — like an anger on the streets of the UK because of what they see happening in Yemen. You see it on Channel 4 news. You see it on the BBC. But then on other side, I mean, I can tell you from negotiating at the UN, whenever you bring up this question of Yemen, it invokes the sort of deep state of the UK. So, even if you have politicians and diplomats around you that are British and are sympathetic to what’s happening in Yemen with the war and Saudi’s involvement there, whenever you try to actually shake them and get anything done, if you try and lobby for a resolution or anything strong on Saudi, it’s a completely — you know, you hit a brick wall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, there’s a real divide there between the people and what sort of Jeremy Corbyn is channeling, and what’s actually being done at Number 10. And especially, we’re talking post-Brexit, there’s this real feeling the trade, and especially trade with Saudi, is so important that that really Trumps anything else right now. So, let’s not get too carried away by what Jeremy Corbyn is saying, and that that might necessarily translate into a different policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sherine Tadros is a former war reporter and a longtime correspondent for Al Jazeera English. She’s currently Amnesty International’s representative to the United Nations in New York. And Mehdi Hasan is the host of UpFront on Al Jazeera English. He’s also a columnist for The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Coming up on the show, we’re gonna talk with MSNBC host Chris Hayes about Trump, Russia, and the police state tactics used in modern-day America. Chris is the author of an important new book, “A Colony in a Nation.” And we’re also gonna talk to Paul Miller, aka DJ Spooky. He composes the music for this show, and his audio work is both legendary and subversive. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, as regular listeners to this show know, last week, the Intercept published a leaked Top Secret intelligence assessment from the National Security Agency. And that assessment outlined alleged Russian cyberattack efforts late last year on companies that make software used in U.S. elections. That document was provided to The Intercept completely anonymously. Within moment of The Intercept publishing this story, the U.S. Justice Department announced that they had arrested a 25-year-old government contractor named Reality Leigh Winner for transmitting defense information under the Espionage Act. Almost instantly, the government moved to unseal all of the FBI affidavits and other government assertions in this case. It was clearly aimed at pushing a narrative. It was aimed at convicting the alleged source in the court of public opinion before she even appeared in court. And it was aimed at ramming through the Justice Department’s allegations as fact.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The government has continued to selectively release allegations against the alleged source, including alleged quotes from her journal, and the contents of her conversations in jail that she’s allegedly had with her family. She is currently being held without bond as the government attempts to destroy her in the media. This is absolutely horrid.\u003cbr />\nAnd thus far, the reporting on the alleged source of this document has come entirely from the assertions of the Trump Justice Department. Now, I know that many people have questions about what happened here and have questions that they want The Intercept to answer. And people have a right to know the answers to those questions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I will say, though, that because the liberty and fate of the alleged source of this document, the person that the government is saying sent this document to The Intercept, because her fate is in the crosshairs of the Justice Department, The Intercept as an institution needs to proceed extremely carefully so as not to impact that case, a case in which the alleged leaker has entered a plea of not guilty. So, I want to be clear here. What I’m gonna say now represents the views of myself and my fellow co-founder of The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald, and not the staff or the editor-in-chief of The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, for those of you who follow me on Twitter, you know that Glenn and I released a statement this week about this issue. And I just want to, in a conversational way, just explain sort of what the point of this statement was. And you can of course read it yourself by going to either Glenn or my Twitter feed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What we said in the statement is that The Intercept is conducting an internal investigation into the publication of this article on June 5\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>. And that investigation is going to include a thorough review of all of the claims that are publicly being made about this episode, including the claims that are made in the Justice Department’s documents about this case. For that reason, and to ensure that nothing could possibly be used by the government in its prosecution of the alleged source of this, The Intercept itself has been institutionally constrained from stating much of anything publicly about the accusations made by the Trump Justice Department and the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, the problem with this is that this silence has allowed journalists, and of course many people on social media, but journalists and serious publications, to make all sorts of demonstrably false claims about this situation. And this deceit is compounded by the fact that the entire narrative that people are stating as the truth of what happened, it’s all coming from affidavits from the Justice Department and the FBI. And the person who is quoted in announcing this indictment of the alleged source is Rod Rosenstein, the guy who wrote the memo that Trump used to justify the firing of FBI director James Comey.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Glenn Greenwald and I didn’t work directly on this story. Neither of us worked on this story. And for that reason, we can say a little bit more than our colleagues about this. The point I want to make to people here, and you can read the full statement for yourself, is that people on social media, including journalists, including some former Bush administration officials turned “resistance leaders,” like David Frum — they’re having a field day with this. And they’re saying, oh, this is proof of blah blah blah about The Intercept. Well, all that is out there in the public realm right now are assertions by Trump’s Justice Department and by an FBI whose chief was fired in a political act by the President of the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And one of the egregious falsehoods that has been spread this week is that the alleged source of this document was listening to this podcast, and she heard Glenn Greenwald and I critically assessing what evidence is there and what evidence isn’t there to support the claims that Russia interfered and hacked the U.S. elections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We’ve been very clear on this show from the beginning that we want to see evidence. And as developments take place, and as more concrete facts come out, we report on them — we address them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So the narrative is, well, she was listening to this podcast, and then because Glenn Greenwald was expressing so much skepticism, she decided to send this top secret document to The Intercept. And the reason that people are saying this is because in the reporting that was done on this initially when the story was published by ABC News and other outlets, said that Reality Leigh Winner had emailed this podcast to request a transcript, or a request to be subscribed to a transcription service — which by the way, we don’t have a transcription service that you subscribe to. We just make our transcripts public.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And somehow, they zero in on the March 22\u003csup>nd\u003c/sup> episode of Intercepted, where Glenn and I, as we have before, were discussing the allegations about Russia hacking the elections. And then high profile people, including Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine, go online, and I’m gonna just directly quote what Jonathan Chait said. He says, “Wow, Reality Winner leaked to The Intercept to try to persuade Glenn Greenwald to stop dismissing the Russia scandal.” The only request that we got from the email that the government alleges was her Gmail account at this podcast was asking for a transcript of an entirely different episode — in fact, an episode where we didn’t even discuss Russia hacking and the elections. It was an episode featuring Naomi Klein talking about climate change, Josh Begley talking about Apple censoring an app that he created that tracks U.S. drone strikes, and Intercept reporter Murtaza Hussain talking about Trump’s intensification of the wars in Syria and Iraq. But this has now gone viral that somehow, this episode on March 22\u003csup>nd\u003c/sup> with Glenn Greenwald talking about this spurred her to do this. And the evidence of it is that the Justice Department said in an affidavit that she had written to the show requesting a transcript of a podcast. They then cherry-picked this one episode and say, well, this must have been it. Well, that’s just not true. That’s not the transcript that was requested.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, this may seem like a minor point, but facts matter. And when you smear people — when you piece together innocuous bits of information and act as though they just exist in a straight line — it’s very damaging. People who are believing everything that the Trump Justice Department are saying in these affidavits, and saying, well, that must be the full story…that’s insane. That’s insane to just say, well, government assertion should just be treated as facts. So, I’m not speaking right now for The Intercept. And I believe in the integrity of the internal review that is being conducted right now at The Intercept, and I believe that in the end, we are going to be able to state clearly the facts as we understand them, and to be accountable to our readers and to be people who support our journalism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The last point I’ll make about this is that there is a war against whistleblowers in this country, and it was being waged under Obama, and it’s clearly moving ahead under Trump. And at the end of the day, the whole point of this war on whistleblowers is to stop the American public from making their own assessments of what is right or wrong by having a complete picture of what’s being done in their name; on whether or not Syria’s allegations are backed up by facts. This war is about preventing accountability for a government that is drunk on secrecy, whether Democrats or Republicans occupy the White House. As we’re able to, we will keep you posted on this situation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As I said, Jeff Sessions testified at the Senate on Tuesday, and he actually had tried to get out of doing it in public. He wanted to just do it behind closed doors. And there were murmurs that Trump was maybe gonna try to intervene. But in the end, the good old boy, he ended up sitting there fielding questions and also getting a hearty defense from many Republican senators that did their best to sort of circle the wagons around him. At issue, of course, were Jeff Sessions’ contacts with Russian officials or representatives before Trump took office. Sessions, of course, has officially recused himself from the Russia investigation, though he also tried to fight that before finally agreeing to it. And at Sessions’ hearing, if you created a word cloud, the biggest phrase that would just jump out and dominate the page would definitely be, “I don’t recall.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff S:\u003c/strong> I don’t recall. I don’t recall. I don’t recall. I don’t recall. I don’t recall. I don’t recall. I do not recall. I don’t recall it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He said it a lot. And it kind of makes you wonder how someone with such a horrible short-term memory could be trusted to be the top law enforcement official in the United States. But Donald Trump is president right now, so that’s sort of the world that we live in. When Sessions was questioned by California Democrat Senator Kamala Harris, he got visibly uncomfortable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Kamala Harris:\u003c/strong> Did you have any communication with any Russian businessmen or any Russian nationals?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff S:\u003c/strong> I don’t believe I had any conversation with Russian businessmen or Russian nationals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KH:\u003c/strong> Are you aware of any communications —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff S:\u003c/strong> Although a lot of people were at the convention. It’s conceivable that somebody came up to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KH:\u003c/strong> Sir, I have just a few —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff S:\u003c/strong> Will you let me qualify it? I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KH:\u003c/strong> Okay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff S:\u003c/strong> If I don’t qualify it, you’ll accuse me of lying, so I need to be correct as best I can.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KH:\u003c/strong> I do want you to be honest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff S:\u003c/strong> And I’m not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, this week is the Sessions show. Last week, it was fired FBI director James Comey. But at the end of the day, what does all of this mean? Last week, on the day Comey testified, I did a public interview with Chris Hayes, the host of MSNBC’s primetime show “All In with Chris Hayes.” Chris is also the author of two really great books. The most recent one, which was just released, is called “A Colony in a Nation.” And he also wrote a book that was published in 2012 called “Twilight After the Elites: America After Meritocracy.” I highly recommend both books. And after Chris and I talked for a bit, I then brought Paul Miller, aka DJ Spooky, into the conversation. And DJ Spooky is familiar to our listeners because he composed our theme and the music that you hear on this show, and he’s really a brilliant composer. And I first was turned on to his work when he did this just devastating remix of D.W. Griffith’s 1915 silent film “Birth of a Nation,” about the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. It’s just a stunning piece that DJ Spooky did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Birth of a Nation,” DJ Spooky remix]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, here is an excerpt from that conversation at the Northside Festival in Brooklyn.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Everyone please give a very warm welcome to Chris Hayes. [Applause] So, Chris, I want to get right to — well, first of all, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chris Hayes:\u003c/strong> It’s great to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we came on, you and I were talking about the connection between your new book, “A Colony in a Nation,” and the kind of approach to Comey that we see in broader society. And my two cents on this is there is this almost lionization in some quarters, including on your network, that, oh, these people are saving us from Trump. The FBI is our friend now. The CIA is our friend now. And I’m wondering your take on that, and also your scholarship, and how that relates to Comey.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so it’s a great question, right? So, this question about sort of the deep state versus Trump, to sort of summarize it. And I guess I get uncomfortable on both sides, right? So, at one level, this is a sort of uncritical lionization of elements within the sort of security apparatus of the U.S. Look, the frustration — and I said this on the show — the frustration with leaks coming out of them that paint the president in a bad light, there is a kernel of legitimate grievance there on behalf of the president and his allies. There’s something a little troubling from a Democratic standpoint that that’s the case, right? This idea of this sort of power center that is opposed to the democratically elected president of the United States and sort of using that machinery. At the same time, I also think it’s really important to keep in mind again that the security apparatus in the deep state, or whatever you want to call it, is embedded in something larger, which is essentially the professional bureaucracy of the U.S. government. And we’ve seen this not just from the security parts. We’ve seen it from the Parks Department. We’ve seen it from the EPA. We’ve seen this from all — so, it’s not just that it’s limited to them, and it’s not just that it’s at play entirely about the security portions of the government. It has been largely a kind of quiet rebellion by the civil servants, the sort of permanent state, the bureaucracy — against their elected leader. It is important to keep in mind that like, yeah, there’s some tension here. But the instinct that we’re seeing from, I think, across the kind of federal bureaucracy, and that includes the sort of so-called deep state, a lot of it, I think, is this instinct towards essentially preservation of what they view as the kind of norms of operation of the government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I do think, and Glenn obviously has pointed this out a ton of times, about leaks, particularly — you know, I’m really a legal realist, to almost the point of a kind of, I think my wife would argue, like nihilism. My wife’s a lawyer. Which is basically that, like, in many circumstances, the law just looks like the suit of armor that will to power wears. That when you talk about, oh, so-and-so broke the law — you see this in the immigration debate, like, well, they broke the law. It’s like, yeah, well, Jeff Sessions lied under oath. And how’s that going? Like, he’s the attorney general. Who here in the room has not broke the law? No hands go up. Everyone’s broken the law. Everyone sitting in this room has broken the law. Everyone sitting in this room has broken the law multiple times. I bet you that people in this room have committed felonies. Like, no question, that have never been investigated or interrogated. Like, lots of places, driving under the influence is a felony. Like, you want to tell me sitting in this room that you haven’t driven under the influence? Do you realize how common that is, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the question then becomes, what’s the law, and then how is the law enforced, and to whom it is applied. And the question right now that sort of is at the top of this entire kind of conceptual pyramid is the question of: is the president subject to it? Does it get applied to him? Because there are people who are sitting in jail for obstruction of justice who have done things that look a lot like the fact pattern that now hangs around the neck of the president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, I always find it fascinating watching you navigate the airwaves of corporate television, because I think watching someone who truly is smart and well-read and is an actual journalist try to survive in that world is very complicated. But I want to appeal to the non-MSNBC employee in your when I ask this question.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> Ruh-roh.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I watch MSNBC during this moment, and I know MSNBC is now number one. Congrats, Chris. But it’s Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, particularly on Rachel Maddow’s show. She has gone all in on this, and I don’t think she would disagree with that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Characterization, because she believes that this is —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> A hundred percent. Underlying, she — yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, right. But many of the Russia, Russia, Russia things that are talked about in the narrative, particularly on MSNBC, are allegations. And the impression that one gets from watching it from hours on end is that all of this stuff is real. And to try to not make you answer for the network —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which you — I don’t think that would be fair to do. But answer this question. Do you think that what MSNBC is doing on many of the shows and by many high profile hosts — I think you’re one of the exceptions to that — is going to undermine how people perceive the actual truth if it comes out, because they’ve gone all in on the pee tape is gonna be real! And, you know, Russia was calling Trump up and telling him, and it’s like every piece of shit that could be flung at the Trump wall, it’s real. It has to stick.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> So, here’s what I would say to that. I’d say three things. One, I think we’ve somehow ended up at the collusion threshold, which is weird, in a way, because the facts short of collusion are quite damning. From the moment that Donald Trump descended the escalator, there has been both a sense among some and a hope among many that there will be a deus ex machina that finishes him. It is undeniable that huge amounts of people have an emotional investment in the idea that the Russia story will be said deus ex machina. And that is driving some of the reception on the part of the audience to it and part of the audience demand, unquestionably. I also think that like, what will undo him is normal politics. And by normal politics, I mean like, if you take peoples’ healthcare away. I think that the standard that’s been set of collusion is probably too high, and I think the facts alone are damning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I also — I have to be — I’ll be totally honest about where I am on this. Because I’ve actually come around a little bit. So, my operating — my own personal — and I basically share that concern, right? That like, I’ve been very careful. I don’t want to get too ahead of the facts of what we know. And it’s hard to report on a black box of classified info that you get anonymously, often with agendas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My operating assumption from the beginning has been like, I don’t think there’s much there in terms of collusion because my Occam’s razor theorizing is that it’s not necessary to explain the facts given, which is to say this: Russia penetrated these computers, and that information was leaked. It was done in a way that was very damaging to one candidate, both in the timing and in the substance, and in whose it was released. That was all happening basically out in the open, while one of the candidates was super hawkish and sort of anti-Putin, and the other was saying really nice things about Putin. One of those candidates looked into a camera and said, “Russia, if you’re listening, please hack my opponent’s emails.” And then the most damaging group of the leaks, which is the Podesta stuff, came out afterwards, while said candidate continued to make official public repeated policy pronouncements that he would be nicer to Russia. What more do you need for all the oars to be moving in the same direction? Like, no one had to be like texting Vladimir to be like, “Hey, what’s up? Can you leak some more emails? We’ll be super cool to you.” It was like, we’ll be super cool to you. I’m telling everyone. And then they were like, “Okay, well, here’s more emails.” So, that was my operating assumption, was that there’s not this thing in the center because you don’t need any explanation to explain the facts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, what has revised that is their conduct about this. Michael Flynn called the ambassador and lied about it. Why did he lie about it? That’s weird. He didn’t just lie about it to the vice president. He lied about it to FBI investigators under penalty of perjury. He’s not facing a criminal investigation. That’s weird. Jared Kushner snuck Sergey Kislyak in the back of Trump Tower and had a meeting he did not disclose on his FA-86 under penalty of perjury. Well, that’s super weird. Like, why do these people keep acting super guilty about their contacts with Russian officials if they have nothing to hide? And so, there’s some part of me that my Occam’s razor has like flipped over, from the Occam’s razor being, I don’t need some very elaborate Rube Goldberg theoretical edifice to explain the facts of why everyone’s working in concert to the Occam’s razor for people acting super sketchy and like they’re in the midst of a cover-up is that they’re in the midst of a cover-up, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And I mean, I agree a hundred percent with everything you’ve said about Flynn and others. And yes — you deserve applause. [Applause] I want to bring on Paul Miller, known popularly as DJ Spooky. He’s an incredible composer, a multimedia artist. We’re gonna talk a lot about his work right now. But the last thing I want to say specifically about him, he does all the music for the Intercepted podcast. Please welcome DJ Spooky. [Applause] I’m gonna hand over the stage to you here and let you take it and walk people through what you’re gonna be sharing today.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Paul Miller:\u003c/strong> Okay. So, Jeremy, just by way of kind of doing like a little bit of archaeology, today, we were talking about media earlier before we got — you know, backstage. And I remixed the film “Birth of a Nation.” For those of you who aren’t aware of it, it’s a sort of early DNA of American media landscape. And D.W. Griffith is generally considered to be the “father of Hollywood.” So, it was considered a true story when it came out. And President Woodrow Wilson had it played at the White House. And it’s similarly considered to be the first film to play at the White House. But there are some deeply problematic issues in it, and I think that’s what we’re gonna maybe unpack a little. But one, the idea of truth and the way that cinema portrayed truth at that time, and the way that it was used to demonize African Americans. And then two, it actually used mostly whites in blackface, so there was this whole idea of the minstrel show, which actually became, again, a foundation of pop culture. So, this idea of the imitation and the displacement of identity, and all these things that are eerily resonant in our current media landscape still go back to this early film.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, with that said and done, the idea was to do a DJ mix applied to cinema. And my motto these days is that, you know, when Bob Dylan took his electric guitar, that transformed rock. But with the turntable, it’s transformed the media. So, to me, the fun part about the 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup> century is we’re all DJs. Some of them, like Trump and his use of media, are a Divine Comedy mashup maybe of like, you know, Dante’s Inferno mixed with Disco Inferno or something. [Laughter] But so, I wanted to do a quick demo of another project that’s just coming up. And it’s — anybody out there remember ? this is, okay, 1967 to 2017, it’s the 50\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> anniversary of the Summer of Love, which was a big deal in pop culture as well. And the Beatles released an album called “Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” So, I was commissioned to do a remix project around that. And I just want to show you guys a little of bits and pieces of the backdrop for a second. All right, so I’m gonna play something you guys all know, and then I’m gonna flip it around. So, say, for example, if I play a clip — and this is, again, applied to media, to sonic media, YouTube, you name it. So, I’m gonna play this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Beatles excerpt]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“This is a Journey into Sound,” Eric B. and Rakim]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Beatles and “This is a Journey into Sound” remix]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> So, I’m remixing it with Eric B. and Rakim, just because they’re cool, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Beatles and “This is a Journey into Sound” remix]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> All right, so you guys got a little life remix. [Applause] So, it’s not every day you hear the Beatles remixed with Eric B. and Rakim, but hey, it’s The Intercept, right? There you go.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You can do it. You were mentioning earlier that you see some analogue to that kind of a project, and then our opportunity for cultural commentary and expression on political figures, political moments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> Sure. I mean, the eerie thing about DJ-ing is it’s about selection. I’m a huge fan of the writer William S. Burroughs and the Beat poets in the ‘50s and ‘60s who did what you call sort of tape cutups. And what they would do to critique the political context at that time — if anyone’s ever read William S. Burroughs “The Ticket that Exploded” or any of his novels were all cutup text. And so, there was this early impulse in the arts to think about political critique by appropriation of media. So, he would take all sorts of bits and pieces. The same thing happened during the early Weimar Republic when artists were going against Hitler. He would be infuriated to see himself mashed up, where there was an artist named John Heartfield, who would cut Hitler’s head off of newspapers and then put it over an ape, and then put posters around Berlin of like, you know, Hitler as an ape — which at that time was shocking, you know? So, artists have always used the tools of the era to do political critique, whether it be graffiti, whether it be tagging and so on. If you were in the Soviet era, you know, you’d have Alexander Solzhenitsyn talking about, you know, they called it the Samizdat, underground newspapers, things like that. So, mix tapes, collage, secret files, torrent. There’s a lot of people who are using the Internet to also critique our contemporary political landscape.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, one of the things I didn’t know about your work, I learned fairly recently, was you did this whole project with National Geographic that is so devastatingly beautiful. On this show, we have said we have a standing commitment to feature the work of artists because fascist movements, authoritarian forces don’t want creation. They don’t want free expression. And that’s part of the reason why we wanted to work with you in shaping how this show would sound. But I wanted you to share with people some of what you’ve been doing with National Geographic about our environment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> So, I want to connect a couple dots, which is that we’re talking about a critique of media. And by the way, I’m a huge fan of Chris, by the way. I view you as a voice of reason in this insane media landscape we call the American press. But the funny thing about the 20\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> versus the 19\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> century was the consolidation of media. So, you have this idea that multiple zillions of newspapers in the 19\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> century consolidated into smaller and smaller amounts of media. And now, of course, with someone like Rupert Murdoch — I always chuckle that his son, the one that was involved with the phone hacking, used to own a really good hip-hop record label, and signed Mos Def and Talib Kwali. Hey, you know? He missed his calling.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Martin Shkreli still, I think, has the hidden Wu Tang album there or something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> That’s right. So, you know, I mean, who could have guessed? But the funny thing about when you’re looking at National Geographic — basically, I went to Antarctica, and I took a studio to several of the main ice fields. And the idea was to do what I call acoustic portraits of ice. And I made hip-hop and electronic music out of the data. And I worked with a group of scientists at Dartmouth’s Cold Regions Research Labs and mathematicians looking at climate data, which is usually not the most, you know, funky-sounding beats. I’ll just leave it at that. But the problem right now is that science needs to update how it talks to the contemporary culture landscape. So, I worked with scientists and then did a series of events, and make music out of the data that they had collected. And then we had a series of large-scale concerts throughout the U.S. But I’m gonna be — I also co-hosted the after events for the March for Science as well. I think it’s so important.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We took over an underground abandoned station underneath Dupont Circle in D.C. and had a great crowd of scientists in dialogue with musicians and artists, and it was a really beautiful evening. So, I think that was the largest gathering of scientists in human history, you know? So, these things are more important than ever. And then you still realize Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord anyway. So, it’s almost like –\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> Just ‘cause he didn’t hear your ice recording.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> Yeah. [Laughs] You know, Ivanka Trump’s not — you know, these kind of people, as much as they’re supposedly part of a cultural rightwing — Ted Nugent is not that funky either, so. They have a very bad arsenal, you know. I’d rather have Jay Z than Ted Nugent any day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Chris, I wanted to ask you, ‘cause you’ve obviously followed these campaigns over the course of your adult lifetime very, very closely. What’s wrong with the Democrats right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, because it really — I mean, it really does seem like they are just masters of kicking own goals left and right. I mean, this very severe battle that took place for the chairmanship of the DNC. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’ tenure at the head of the DNC, the dirty tricks against Bernie Sanders that were revealed in those hacked emails. But it just seems like they don’t know what they’re doing. And I’m wondering if you share that, or if you have a more nuanced take.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> I think the nature of this sort of pendulum of American polarization at this moment is that governing sort of saps capital, and opposition builds it up. So, you know, in terms of activation, in terms of how much people are plugged in, whether that’s volunteers, donors, how much they’re paying attention, like, being in opposition is energizing. And you saw that with the Tea Party. You saw that with the Republican Party, which was eviscerated and moribund after eight years of Bush, right? So, there’s a sort of — a little bit of this pendulum nature to it. The broader thing, I think, is that the Democratic Party shares the problem of center left parties across the OECD world, which is broadly, I would say, the kind of ideological exhaustion of the neoliberal project. There is this kind of degree to which it is, from a class perspective, very much sort of winners of the meritocracy, very much tied to the professional class, and are increasingly untethered from the locus of working class power as particularly represented in the labor as labor has shrunk. At its top, in terms of the people that staff these offices, it is a party of the professional class, and a certain kind of urbane cosmopolitan professional class that is attenuated from particularly the white working class. I think less attenuated, actually, ironically, from the working class of black and Latino folks. And that has to do with the nature of the political coalitions in the country. So, there’s that problem as a sort of class problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But that to me is just embedded in the larger architecture of what the kind of vision of equality and justice in the country is, which is a problem that sort of stretches the Western world, which is like, what is the sort of comprehensive vision for like, a just, humane, and equitable society in the 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup> century? What does that look like? And there was a very long period of time in which all of the center left parties of the Western world sort of arrived at this kind of neoliberal vision, some of which actually had some really genuinely strong ideological points, some of which was underwritten by really insidious interests. I mean, it was a sort of interesting collage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what I think you’ve seen is a kind of bankrupting of that ideological vision. And I think the reason that you see, in Bernie Sanders and in Jeremy Corbyn, that they both have this fascinating thing that’s happening, which is that old people view Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn very poorly, right? The crosstabs of the approval is that the older you are, the less inclined you are to like them. And part of the reason is, if you’re old, they both sound like throwbacks. If you’re young, they sound totally fresh and revolutionary. Because what they’re saying are ideas and ways of talking about justice, about the commons, about collective ownership, even, that have been completely erased from the political vocabulary of mainstream center left parties for 40 years. They have them from back before that. And so, when Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders talk in those terms to 25-year-olds, it’s like, “This dude is blowing my mind!” It’s like, right, yeah, that’s socialism. Like, there’s like — the whole Labour Party was built on it, dude. They used to own coalmines, like the government did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, go ahead, Paul.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> And Chris, I just want to jump in as well, because I think what’s fascinating is that you have mainly white older voters voting against their own interest. And the eerie thing about seeing Republican demagoguery and the way that they manipulate use — basically a lot of older people have a very — they’re not as circumspect when they’re reading or getting this kind of computational propaganda on Facebook or whatever. The eerie and sad thing is that younger people have a better sense of literacy, but are not voting as much. So, the right wing marches in lockstep. They will make sure that their people show up. I mean, elections matter. The problem may be — with the last election, as well — was the turnout was low, enthusiasm was low. But meanwhile, the right wing, with Trump’s energized kind of rabble of all sorts of — you know, the deplorables, as we all call them — they went and made sure to show up. To me, the sad thing right now is we have this eerie sense of the way the law’s written and the way we live of parted ways. And meanwhile, the thing that’s filling the gap is this kind of radioactive cloud of just people with no sense of their own stakeholdership in this society, or the fabric of society.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We should be clear here that the Obama administration was no friend of journalism or a free press in this country, or around the world. And because Trump is so cartoonishly villainous and bad, it’s easy to forget that, because under Obama, you had this incredibly brilliant, articulate president who had a firm grasp of the English language, unlike the president that came before him or the president that came after him. So, you know, just on that basis alone, it’s easy to think, “Oh my god, we’re in this hellhole.” But isn’t part of this, you know, Trump saying to James Comey, “Can’t we put journalists in jail who publish leaked information?” Trump really talking about the enemy of the press, and adopting terms that were popularized by Joseph Goebbels and others in Nazi Germany, the idea of the lying press, the fake press. And of course, Goebbels wrote about once you undermine public trust in the media, then the rest will sort of fall into place. Is there a broader lesson that we can learn from what we’re experiencing right now with Trump that will strengthen core institutions that seek to preserve the democratic aspects of our society, like a free press? You want to take that one first?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> I would say my short version of this is that the big lesson to me of this era so far is that the actual most foundational pillars of a free society are outside the state. They’re a civil society. And that has been a real reminder that the sort of institutional vibrancy of a free society is — ultimately does rest in civil society, and that in some ways, that’s a very empowering feeling. The state can do a lot of terrible things, and I don’t want to downplay the importance of state power. The state can pollute us into a cooked planet. It can bomb people. It does both of those things. But the sort of checks and the most important ones do — are ultimately with we the people, and the way that we order civil society, the amount of courage we’re willing to have, the degree to which we do or do not tolerate breaches of certain norms. And to me, that’s a kind of empowering lesson of where we are right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Paul?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> And Chris, you know, just to follow on that note, one of my favorite theoreticians is Antonio Gramsci, and he has a great quote where he says, you know, “The challenge of modernity is to live without illusions and without becoming disillusioned.” And to me, the fabric of democracy is truly about having an informed citizenry. And if people don’t have a certain degree of skepticism about what they’re actually being, you know, kind of exposed to, then we need to upgrade peoples’ sense of literacy. And the funny thing is, literacy as we know it is evolving — so, hip-hop, techno, dubstep. On the other hand, where your average kid is going to YouTube, and all these different platforms that — of course, your podcast as well. People have to really think about the layers and layers and layers of this kind of new media archaeology. And I think the problem with the 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup> century is we have one foot in the dead media of the 20\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> century, and one foot in the sort of entropic landscape that, for better or for worse, people like Robert Mercer and, of course, Peter Thiel with Palantir, and Cambridge Analytics, those guys are definitely like, demons of data. They’re totally, all puns intended, just awful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> So, the good news here is that digital media and other kinds of very “democratized” culture has this new kind of literacy. And your average kid is growing up in Western — as you say, OECD country, with a cell phone. And we’ve seen when that causes revolutions, for better or for worse, in the Middle East, for example. As more people who access new kinds of ways of communicating, they change their societies. But in the U.S., I think we have a degree of complacency, and we also have a degree of people expecting, you know, oh, they wouldn’t do that. But you know what? They would. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Chris, last thing. Does Trump make it through one term as president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> I tell everyone this, that the expectation everyone should have is that the president of the United States serves a four-year term, and then he’s up for reelection. And if people don’t like the president of the United States, then they should think about how they will defeat him politically.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, he doesn’t quit? He doesn’t have a heart attack? He doesn’t get impeached?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> I mean, I can’t say who and who isn’t gonna have a heart attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. No, no. [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> I mean, I just mean that as like — that’s a sort of bolt from above.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CH:\u003c/strong> But in terms of — I think people tell themselves, he’s gonna get impeached, he’s gonna quit. Like, I went through 18 months — 16 months of a campaign where it was like, he’s gonna drop out. He’s not gonna — like, I’ve been through that. Like, your default assumption is that the president of the United States is elected to a four-year term that he will serve.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> Well, Pence is worse, so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You think Pence is worse, but does Trump make it, you think, for — through the whole term?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> I think, you know, he fired Comey. You know, the funny thing about the — firing the director of the FBI, he’s got a lot of layers going on here. And it’s all —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sure does.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PM:\u003c/strong> And it’s all — lots of other little secrets that pop out. And so, I think it’s — I’m intrigued to see how that’s going to accelerate what’s probably going to be a deeply unstable situation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, let’s give a big round of applause to DJ Spooky, Paul Miller, Chris Hayes. [Applause] Paul Miller is popularly known as DJ Spooky. He’s an artist, a composer, and an all around musical phenomenon. He also, of course, created the music on this show, the Intercepted podcast. Chris Hayes is the host of “All In with Chris Hayes” on MSNBC, and his latest book is called “A Colony in a Nation.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That does it for this week’s show. Intercepted is a production of First Look Media and The intercept. We’re distributed by Panoply. Our producer is Jack D’Isidoro, and our executive producer is Leital Molad. Rick Kwan the chef is back on the job, and he mixed this week’s show again. He was off-duty because he has a new baby boy named Hugo.

This week on Intercepted: We speak to radical librarian Alison Macrina of the Library Freedom Project about the fight against digital surveillance. Sam Biddle gives an update on attacks on U.S. voting systems. And, we speak with one of the rising stars of the “dirtbag left,” Felix Biederman of Chapo Trap House, about #Resistance Twitter, why establishment Democrats are not leftists, and where he believes David Frum really belongs.

I mean, I don’t think it’s that simple, but I don’t think we’re getting anywhere, so let me move on.

The former FBI director said that without a doubt, the Russians have —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> I understand. I’ve seen the reports.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Reporter:\u003c/strong> Uh, does the president share those views?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS:\u003c/strong> I, I have not sat down and asked him about his specific reaction to them, so I’d be glad to touch base and get back to you, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Reporter:\u003c/strong> Didn’t you say it was fake news, Sean? Didn’t the president —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump and his inner circle have all lawyered up, and the investigation is moving forward into any potential wrongdoing relating to Russian officials potentially talking to members of the Trump campaign in the weeks and months leading up to the presidential election. There was a skirmish this past weekend over what Trump meant when he tweeted that there is an investigation into him, after he had just spent weeks and weeks claiming that fired FBI director James Comey had told him three times that there wasn’t an investigation into him. Watching Trump’s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, on television over the weekend was at times just plain bizarre, and like a lot of things these days, sort of parallel universe-y.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jay Sekulow:\u003c/strong> So, he’s being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the termination. So, that’s the constitutional threshold question here, and that’s why, as I said, no investigation, because —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Fox News Anchor Chris Wallace:\u003c/strong> Well, I — what, what’s the question? I mean, you stated — you stated some facts. First of all, you’ve now said that he is being investigated after saying that you didn’t —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Sekulow:\u003c/strong> No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW: \u003c/strong>You, you just said, sir —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Sekulow:\u003c/strong> No, he’s not being investigated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> You just said that he’s being investigated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J. Sekulow:\u003c/strong> No, Chris, I said that the inve — anything — let me be crystal clear, so you completely understand. We have not received, nor are we aware of any investigation of the president of the United States. Period.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CW:\u003c/strong> Sir, you just said two times that he’s being investigated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> While all eyes in Washington remain focused on the Russia investigation, the existence of yet another massive data breach came to light. It wasn’t so much of a breach as it was an apparent epic act of recklessness, carelessness. A California-based security researcher says that Republican-linked election databases were inadvertently exposed to the entire Internet, potentially violating the privacy of almost every single registered voter in the United States. This exposed information, we understand, contained the sensitive personal details of more than 198 million American voters. We do not know exactly how this happened, but it does appear to be some sort of a massive mistake. Joining me now to break this down is my colleague Sam Biddle. He’s the technology reporter for The Intercept. Sam, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sam Biddle:\u003c/strong> Glad to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, this news that’s developing this week, that a Republican contractor’s database was left exposed on the Internet, and it’s upwards of a couple hundred million peoples’ data has been exposed — what’s the takeaway from this? What does it mean?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Sure. So, very importantly, this isn’t a hack. There’s no evidence that this data was improperly accessed or stolen or downloaded or proliferated in any way. That doesn’t mean that no one did access it. It was not the result of a breach. Basically, someone left their front door open, and anyone with the URL could have downloaded terabytes of information detailing not just the demographic information of 198 million American potential voters, but their sort of ideological proclivities and leanings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Because it would show their voter registration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yes, but actually, there was a lot more to it than just what was on paper. Using proprietary computer modeling, the details of which are a little sketchy, this company, Deep Root Analytics, actually had scored all 198 million people in the database on almost 50 different belief categories, like whether they support STEM, job training, or whether they, you know, would support the repeal of Obamacare, that sort of thing. So, really, not just your address and your age and your race, which again is sensitive enough on its own, but your opinions and your personally held beliefs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What were they basing that on?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> It’s a mixture of sort of educated guesswork and old-fashioned phone polling, you know, and focus group kind of work. A lot of it is extrapolated, so it’s not like they contacted or had actually gotten responses from 198 million people. It’s computer modeling, so it’s an algorithmic guess, basically. But the fact that it exists, I think, is surprising to most people, to know that they have tabs being kept on them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And, you know, the headlines, as I saw them, were focused on a Republican contractor’s database, was left exposed basically for anybody that wanted to walk up and access that information. But it’s not just Republicans or conservatives whose data was essentially made available to the public because of this — well, fuckup.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, right. So, Deep Root doesn’t just work with the RNC. Their raison d’etre is to help target ads, TV ads. So, if you are ExxonMobil, and you want to make sure that people who are very skeptical of ExxonMobil are seeing your ads in order so that they could be convinced, you might turn to Deep Root Analytics so you would know exactly when to buy ads, where to buy them, so that you’re reaching exactly the eyeballs you want to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> For everyday people listening to this, what’s the thing they should worry about, given that this front door was basically left open with a lot of what appears to be sensitive data about just under 200 million voters in this country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Well, it would certainly be a boon to anyone who has a streak for identity theft. I mean, personally identifying information is often parlayed into a greater identity theft attack. It would also help anyone who wants to undertake a spear phishing campaign. If someone knows that you are, you know, inclined to subscribe to the Sierra Club newsletter or something, and you get an email from them that’s actually from a hacker, you might be more inclined to click it. I think really, it’s more eye-opening in terms of, wow, I didn’t realize that all this stuff was being tracked about me, that the odds of this being — this resulting in an identity theft for one person among 198 million is probably on the lower end, but this should really be a wakeup call to how — what kind of data is being collected about us, how it’s being used, how it’s being sold, and why aren’t there more laws regulating this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before I let you go, I wanted to just get a quick update from you. You were one of the four reporters that broke this big story based on this Top Secret NSA document that we got anonymously that showed Russian cyberattack efforts targeting software companies that provide services to the U.S. voting system. And our understanding of it at the beginning, this software was used in at least eight states.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the Bloomberg news agency, after that story was published, started digging, and it looks now like it’s as many as 39 states that were using this software from VR Systems. Now, your role in that story, of course, was you were interviewing experts to get analysis on what the significance of the document was to this broader system, which is why I wanted to ask you what the significance of this Bloomberg reporting is, that it was used in 39 states.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> So, what’s incredible about the way America votes is how decentralized it is, and how little each state has to do with the state next to it in terms of how votes are actually tabulated, how voters are registered. So, the fact that one contractor could be used so extensively and be so vulnerable to outside threat, without really anyone noticing until it’s too late, is a big deal. And everyone I talk to highlighted that, that having a decentralized voting system, where there’s not just one entity collecting and tabulating all the votes, is a strength. In some ways, it’s harder to hack. But when it’s so decentralized and so unorganized, for lack of a better word, then it’s really worrying.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is the significance of the fact that there is no standard in this country — state to state, the states make their own decisions on what the standards are for the mechanisms and technology that are used for voting?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Right. So, a big worry there is that because each state is going to do elections its own way, and each polling station is going to have differing levels of scrutiny and carefulness, it makes it easier for outside agents, you know, whether they be Russians, or Chinese, or anyone to get in there. It’s possible to penetrate a company, and it’s not like you’re taking on the FEC or something, right? These are small, relatively small organizations, small entities that are gonna have, you know, no more security precautions than any other small business, really.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And I think, and I’ve been saying this since that initial Top Secret NSA document story came out, that I think a lot of analysts, and many of them motivated by their own partisan concerns, are just looking at the Russian trees in a forest filled with voting system insecurities in this country. And the biggest takeaway for me on this is not that Russian military intelligence is trying to penetrate the systems of companies that service the election, but that our electoral system is highly vulnerable to hackers or intruders of a variety of stripes, including non-nation-state actors with not that great of phishing or hacking capabilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, that’s absolutely right. I mean it may very well be that Russian military intelligence was just brazen enough to have been caught or noticed by the NSA. But the level of sophistication here would certainly not rule out nation-state actors from really any nation-state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sam Biddle, thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SB:\u003c/strong> Happy to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sam Biddle is a technology reporter at The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, we talk a lot about hacking and cyber breaches on this program, and we do a lot of reporting on it at The Intercept. But in general in this society, not nearly enough attention is given to what ordinary people can and are doing to preserve their privacy. The Intercept recently launched a video series called “Cybersecurity for the People.” And it features our resident computer security engineer Micah Lee.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Micah Lee:\u003c/strong> Law enforcement at protests use tools to try and spy on peoples’ phones. If you get arrested, your phone might get searched. And so, if you’re going to a protest, the first thing that you should do to secure your phone is make sure that you lock it with a passcode, ‘cause when your fingerprint can unlock your phone, people can just take your hand and push it on your phone to unlock your phone. This isn’t true with a passcode. They need to actually have you cooperate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was my colleague Micah Lee. You can see that video and all the others in this series, “Cybersecurity for the People,” at theintercept.com.\u003cbr />\nNow, among the groups in this country that are fighting to preserve peoples’ privacy, particularly online, of course, is the American Civil Liberties Union, but also, a lesser known group is doing incredibly important work, and that is the Library Freedom Project. That’s a partnership of librarians, technologists, attorneys, privacy advocates — all united in trying to confront and ultimately stop digital surveillance. We’re joined now by the founder and director of the Library Freedom Project, Alison Macrina. Alison, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alison Macrina:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Talk about the work that you do with the organization you founded, the Library Freedom Project.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> The Library Freedom Project is an organization that I started a few years ago that’s devoted to the promotion and protection of privacy and intellectual freedom, mainly in libraries. I started working on this when I was a librarian outside of Boston, Massachusetts. And when the Snowden revelations came out, I started thinking about the privacy problem much more deeply than I had before in a professional context. Librarians have a really great history of caring about privacy and fighting for intellectual freedom and all these wonderful democratic ideals, but what was different to me after Snowden was that obviously, we see now that the problem is much more massive. And I started hearing directly from members of my community about how they wanted to learn about protecting their privacy. So, it had a really bold effect on peoples’ feelings about their own Internet use. So, I had a personal interest in information security and in free and open source software. I was the technology librarian, so I had some tech background. And so, I started teaching some computer privacy classes. They got to be pretty big, and I, from there, decided to build something that was more of a “train the trainers” kind of operation for librarians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I connected with my local ACLU, which was the Massachusetts affiliate. And so, we put together this little crack team of privacy people, and we basically made a little privacy roadshow. And we started going to libraries, teaching librarians about what they can do to protect their patrons; what’s going on in the courts with regard to surveillance law and policy; what the kind of corporate digital capitalism landscape is like; and then what are the tools that they can use and the best practices that they can employ to help members of the community protect themselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And also, you’ve described yourself as a radical librarian, and had I not worked with Amy Goodman at Democracy Now! I don’t think I would have known this kind of alternative history of librarians in the post-9/11 America, and how librarians fought against the Patriot Act — not just the passage of the Patriot Act, but once it was implemented, librarians coming up with creative ways to ensure the privacy of peoples’ records, of what they’d been reading and checking out of the library. I think of librarian, I think of good old Mrs. Stelsel, my librarian at my high school, who literally looked like the Church Lady.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Clarence:\u003c/strong> You’re not gonna like it, George.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George Bailey:\u003c/strong> Where is she?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Clarence:\u003c/strong> She’s an old maid. She never married.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GB:\u003c/strong> Where’s Mary? Where is she? Where is she?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>C:\u003c/strong> She’s just about to close up the library!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, you’re a young, radical activist, and it’s like young people going to be nuns. You really don’t see it all that often. And maybe this is just that I’m — I have a misconception about librarians, but I’m fascinated by the institution of librarian as freedom fighter. So, maybe talk about that kind of post-9/11 evolution in the field of library science.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Well, I think just like nuns, you know, you only need to scratch the surface, and you find that there’s a really rich radical tradition with librarians, and I wouldn’t discount Ms. Stelsel so fast, right? I mean, part of the — part of what we enjoy, I think, as librarians, is this ability to be more unassuming radicals. The procession itself has always been pretty open to progressives and far leftists. Part of the reason I joined the profession is because of what you said about the Patriot Act. And I think a lot of — there was a real resurgence in interest in librarianship around that time. But that’s not at all where it began. I mean, you know, librarians have been fighting back against overbroad and unlawful government surveillance for decades. They were some of the staunchest opponents of the House on American Activities Committee. They wrote a fantastic document in defense of intellectual freedom and privacy called the Freedom to Read statement. And that was in the 1950s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, part of why they’ve been kind of ignored in the landscape of all these activist issues is because they’re largely a female profession. They’re overworked and underpaid. They provide a lot of essential social services that have been cut in the last few decades. And so, they don’t have this really strong voice in the fight, but they’re doing the work on the ground, and they have been for a very long time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do librarians think of sort of what’s happening with issues of privacy in our country? Not to mention basic literacy issues with our president, but that’s a different — that’s a totally different discussion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> They’re concerned about the players, the adversaries in the erosion of privacy, what kind of effect they have on other intellectual freedom issues. For example, if digital capitalism is creating shadow profiles of all of us, it’s not just that it’s a problem because they’re collecting all this information about us. It’s a problem because now they have the ability to manipulate us on an individual level and at a broad — at a scale. They were also concerned about having a commons that’s free from corporate interference and from government law enforcement and intelligence agency malfeasance. One of the reasons why this makes so much sense to them is because that’s what the library really is. I mean it’s the only true public commons that we have. And they see the Internet as an obvious extension of that, but that it’s being tainted by all of these big powerful players who are trying to control it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to ask you, because I had the pleasure recently of watching one of your presentations about privacy. You and I both spoke at a wonderful Catholic church in New Jersey. And I really was kind of in awe, because you had a very mixed crowd. There were young tech-savvy people there, and there were also like very elderly people who are very engaged on a social and political level, and they are using the Internet, but not the most tech-savvy crowd or generation around today. But you gave a very accessible presentation for how people can protect their privacy and their communications. Can you give a kind of brief overview of how you talk to ordinary people about protecting their privacy, both on their computers, but also on their mobile devices?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> For the most part, ordinary people, nontechnical people, they have a really strong interest in learning this stuff, but no one has really taken the time to talk to them about it without using jargon or anything like that. I try to focus mainly on the things that I know that pretty much everybody can get a handle on. So, Signal is something that the barrier to entry is very low. I mean, in some ways, it doesn’t function as well as other messaging apps that folks might be used to using, but it’s getting better all the time, and it’s getting even more feature-rich. Like, it just added video calling. And so, in a lot of ways, Signal’s kind of a good gateway drug to other security tools because it’s so simple. It shows people that they can — if they take this one step, it’s doing a lot, and they’re capable of doing more. And then, I try to focus just on some best practices. And I want people to think about the relationship that they have to all these private companies and government entities that are collecting using their data.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When I really focus on these relationships, who these powerful entities are, how they’re trying to shape public opinion, what this information might be used for, especially in Trump’s America with a Sessions DOJ and the expansion of law enforcement and all this, that tends to be mostly what people kind of come for. You know, they want to know who’s behind all this stuff. And in a lot of ways, I think when you help them understand the landscape, they’re more willing to take the steps. ‘Cause usually, it was just like their nephew, who has a computer science degree, who made a bunch of changes to their computer that they didn’t understand, and they don’t want to use any of it because they don’t get why it matters or anything like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your broader advice to people, given that you mentioned Jeff Sessions, but also the — you know, what we already know about the surveillance state, about the FBI. What — in general, what would you advise people that are working on immigration issues, race issues, anti-war issues? Like, what are the most important things for people to be aware of and consider on a technical digital communications level?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> We really have to take some steps to secure our information now, given what we know is likely to happen in the very near future, because it’s very hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube after that. I would also say, though, that it is possible to make yourself more secure against these adversaries. And it really — it depends a little bit on which ones you’re most concerned about. You know, some people, their fears might be the Sessions DOJ, and what that means in terms of law enforcement’s ability to subpoena information from your carrier or from private companies. Some people might be more worried about the private data collection, the Robert Mercers of the world. That kind of, you know, big data, billion-dollar operations that are creating shadow profiles on everyone and using it to manipulate public opinion. But we need to start thinking about this stuff. And it is definitely possible to make some changes in our behavior and protect ourselves, but we can’t proceed as if these things are not threats to our movements, because, you know, you create enough chaos, and you totally disassemble the movement. That’s what COINTELPRO was all about, and we have — the capabilities that exist now really put COINTELPRO to shame.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your assessment of the security of the data that the president of the United States is walking around with, based on what we publicly know about Trump’s social media habits and the devices he uses?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] You know, the only way that it could be worse, I think, is if he had one of those exploding Samsung phones, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Like — and he might, honestly. I don’t actually know what the make of his Android phone is. But Android is the insecure mobile platform. I highly doubt that he’s giving that thing over to somebody to run updates. Frankly, I’m shocked that no one has hacked his phone yet, given his practices you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, but they actually may have.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> They may have, right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, hacks aren’t always announced in real time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> That’s true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We’ve joked that the password is probably all caps, just ‘AMERICA.’ But it also — it could be, like he — maybe somebody told —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Misspelled.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Misspelled, right. But it could be that somebody said, hey, you need a passphrase, and one that you really, really can remember. So, now it could be “Grab ‘em by the pussy.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Right, right, right, right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, would that be a secure, if he made the ‘S’ into a dollar sign, the ‘G’ was capitalized, then he used ‘E-M’ instead of ‘them,’ would that be a secure passphrase?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> You would need some more entropy. Another way to think about that is randomness. And so, you know, for Trump to have a truly secure passphrase, I mean, one of the things he’d have to start with is nothing identifiable to him. So, in some ways, a more secure passphrase would be like, ‘I love Barack Obama’ or something like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> You know? Because no one would ever — [laughs] don’t use that passphrase, people. It’s not secure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wait, so, but if Trump — okay, let’s say — so, you’re talking to Trump, and you’re trying to come up with a passphrase. But it also has to be one that he can remember. So, let’s say he thinks it’s really funny, your suggestion, because of course, he doesn’t love Barack Obama, the Muslim from Kenya.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And he says, “Okay, I want a way to use the passphrase ‘I love Barack Obama’ to, like, secure my — you know, my Twitter account.” Put aside for a second two-factor verification. Let’s just talk about that passphrase. I love Barack Obama. What should he do to kind of spice it up to make it more difficult for somebody to guess or to have a machine rapidly guess that password?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Really, the way to make a secure and memorable passphrase, you want to use something called the Diceware method. Sometimes it’s called the XKCD method because it’s based on a comic that XKCD published about how terrible everyone’s passwords are. So, you need a die, just a regular six-sided die. 20-sided die — I’m sorry, nerds — will not work. And you need the Diceware wordlist. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has actually made a really great version of the Diceware wordlist. And it’s basically about — it’s a list. It’s a little less than 8,000 words long. And every word has a corresponding five-digit number. And what you do is, you take your die. You roll it five times. It gives you a number. Then you look on the list. You do a little control+F to find the number. When you find your five-digit number, you look next to it, and whatever that word is, that’s the first word in your passphrase. And so, you can memorize a string of four or five words much more easily than you can memorize a jumble of letters, numbers, and symbols. And it’s much more secure than what people typically do when they think they’re creating a strong passphrase, which is, you know, ‘I love Barack Obama,’ with all the vowels removed and replaced by numbers or symbols. That’s not actually that secure, and it’s pretty difficult to remember.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Alison, we’re gonna leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Thanks so much for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alison Macrina is the founder and director of the Library Freedom Project. Coming up on the show, we’re gonna talk to one of the founding hosts of the popular podcast Chapo Trap House, Felix Biederman. We’re gonna talk about Twitter, the Democrats, Saudi Arabia, and much more. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Chapo Trap House theme music]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back here on Intercepted, and as many of you who listen to this show probably know, I love Twitter. Well, I shouldn’t say I love Twitter. I use Twitter actively, and I have from very early on. But I have to say that Twitter is a vile cesspool that many of us continue to willingly swim in all day, every day. Donald Trump certainly spends a disproportionate amount of his presidency tweeting about what he watches on television. Twitter is also a place that can win you immediate gratification. “Oh, everybody loves me. Look at how many retweets I have. Look at how many likes I have.” It can also subject you to a massive group pummeling of shame. This contradictory terrain of Twitter also brought together a ragtag crew of millennials who created and host the popular podcast Chapo Trap House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Will Menaker:\u003c/strong> Obama gave this press conference the other day where he was like —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Matt Christman:\u003c/strong> Oh, where the libs were like —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Amber A’lee Frost:\u003c/strong> Oh my god, yeah, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> He’s gonna kick the door open and be like, “Yo, yo, motherfuckers.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Felix Biederman:\u003c/strong> I love how they — like, they just betray their racism when they talk about Obama. They’re like, “I can’t wait until he comes in there and he has a fresh new fade.” And it’s like, what are you talking about? Fucking weirdo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AF:\u003c/strong> Well, he’s not the black person of your fantasy, Tim Wise.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, Tim Wise was like, he’s gonna on there, and he’s gonna look directly in the camera and say, “Mr. Putin, you bitch motherfucker.” Also, “Tim Wise can say the N-word.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AF:\u003c/strong>[Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On their show, they shred both Democrats and Republicans. They take on the so-called elite media and the punditocracy in this country. But they also engage in deep dive analysis of weird Twitter personalities and Twitter beefs. They also have shown a remarkable ability to predict the outcome of electoral races. And the show is not as simple as to be able to just categorize it as one thing. And what they definitely do all the time is piss people off. In fact, one of my favorite articles on Chapo Trap House was published last year by the conservative Catholic publication First Things. It was an article titled, “Christians Stay Away from Irony Bros.” And here’s a passage from that piece.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The Chapo guys are just as willing to attack the Clintons for their neoliberalism, or the audience of Hamilton for enjoying a self-flattering, wiggish retelling of history as they are to attack mainstream conservative pundits. They are just as likely to envision in detail the violent deaths of pundits on the left, as they are to envision in detail the violent deaths of pundits on the right. All of which is okay because it’s ironic, and because anyone who espouses any political or economic theory that has even a hint of neoliberalism is a hypocritical hack who deserves nothing but scorn. Like Holden Caulfield, the Chapo guys believe everyone is phony. Unlike Holden Caulfield, they are sometimes witty. No one escapes their destructive gaze.” Joining me now is one of the original hosts of Chapo with that destructive gaze, Felix Biederman. Felix is also a freelance writer. Welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Felix Biederman:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I can’t recall an analogue to what has sort of happened with you guys. I mean, it’s sort of — obviously, there’s some bit of it that’s uncharted territory, but, you know, you guys have been written up in The New Yorker. You’ve had the rightwing Catholic publication First Things basically say that you’re corrupting the young minds of America with your show. What do you make of all this attention, both the negative and the fact that you have so many people that actually like what you do?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> I think two things are going on. I think for one, podcasts are one of my favorite pieces of media to consume because if you like the people doing it and you think they’re interesting and funny and everything, it’s like you’re just listening to a great conversation with your friends. Most conversations we have are like people bitching about traffic, or like, how there are no bathrooms in Midtown or something. But for people who are a bit dislocated socially, which is very common nowadays — we live in a really isolated, fraught times for very many people, especially young people that listen to this. They’re uncertain about their future. They’re uncertain about what they’re supposed to do, because everything that seemed to work for their parents and even older siblings, it’s not there for them. And things are more socially atomized than ever. But if you can put your headphones in and you can listen to this conversation, you can laugh, you can smile; you can feel engaged with something on this personal level that you wouldn’t quite feel in an article.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think on the other hand, both many parts of the left and everyone who is now mad at us, they thought, “Well, these people are never really gonna be close to power, but they’re right about their prescription, the problems. They’re all very funny and cool to talk to.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then I think after Sanders and after Cobyn and after — when you see a group of people that goes from like, “This is sort of silly but it’s cute, I like these people,” to “This is something that people really identify with. And they are gonna take action based on it. They are gonna vote a certain way. They are gonna organize a certain way,” it becomes very scary. To make leftism fun is, I think, very scary for some people. And the fact that we have this thing that is successful, people do see it as a bellwether in a way that I do not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it also inspires this sort of almost deranged ire from the hash tag known as #theresistance —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On Twitter. Like, what do you make of that phenomenon? Not just like the, you know, Keith Olbermann wrapped in an American flag, you know, for his glamor shots.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Well, it was originally a Syrian Arab Army flag. They had to Photoshop it. Probably from my collection.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it is like self-parody, except they don’t get it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But what do you make of that sector of Twitter? Because of course, they loathe you. But it’s — you know, they loathe us too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, what — like, what do you make of the people that actually, without kidding, use the hash tag #theresistance?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> I don’t think we’re like waking every — anyone up, but I think to hear us, to say, like, we think imperialism is evil. We think that many core characteristics of this country, of our society are sick, and that there are — we have a lot of work to do. Things aren’t great. Things are heading to be even worse if we don’t fix some of these systemic things. If you see that and it’s successful, and you have your set of solutions that you think are kind of easy, and it’s this club, it’s this cultural thing where you watch Sam Bee and you share these wordy memes, and you’re the resistance, and it’s very pithy and smug, and you have these established power structures you can go to: I think it is scary when there’s a very loud voice saying, “It’s not this easy,” and a lot of stuff is fucked up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But what I’m getting at is that there is a sort of one voice that — it’s almost like this big organic, ever-evolving meme online, where you have people that have this kind of cultish notion that it was Hillary’s turn, and anyone who didn’t get that is Team Putin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, Jill Stein is, you know, the Green Party candidate. We just had her on recently. We got bombarded with hate mail about that. But, you know, basically anybody who wasn’t waving the Hillary flag has been portrayed as responsible for the ascent of Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> It’s — I mean, when prophecy fails, right? Before the election, they were all browbeaten, like, “You fucking idiots. You have no impact on this. She’s gonna crush Trump without you. Fuck you. You’re a loser. Bernie’s a loser, you’re a loser.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then when she doesn’t win, suddenly we’re all-powerful. All the people that said we were like a two-bit operation before the election, now come at me screaming, saying we lost it for Hillary. Like we even have 50,000 listeners in Wisconsin. Probably not that at all, but those people, they go into such psychosis about us and you guys because it’s like, well, if you were saying America is already great, and we’re, you know — we’re better than Trump. All these insane things. You know, I was just thinking about when people were saying if Hamilton could see Trump. What? He would — the guy who had all these friends and owned slaves, he would think Trump’s too racist? But you believe this myth about America, and the world, and your own beliefs. And when it fails, you will make any enemy much more powerful than they actually are. But because their perfect plan fell apart, and America and the world is revealed to be not what they said it is, it has to be everyone conspired against them. You know, the day after the election was so instructive for me because we were heartbroken, but at the same time, we were like, well, we’ve got work to do. For us, it was to go after the people that lost this for the DSA. They just fuckin’ went out there and organized.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You refer — Democratic Socialists of America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Democratic Socialists, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which is going through a renaissance right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> After years of kind of lying dormant, you have a lot of young people that are organizing under the banner of DSA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Right. They were like, well, this sucks, but we’re gonna work even harder now. And they tripled their membership. The left hit the ground running on November 9\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, and these people were just like — they retreated into fantasy. They thought that like, we would declare the election void. Looking for signs in Hillary tweets. And it was like, they think that because we — everyone on the left started working, that they planned this somehow, or that they’re not distraught by this. They don’t think it’s a big deal. When the opposite is true. We think it’s a fucking disaster, even if we think that many of the things Trump’s doing are just extensions of problems we said existed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It’s quite remarkable. I mean, anyone that knows the history of the former member of the British Parliament, Louise Mensch —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Oh, she’s great.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, sees the kind of ridiculousness of the embrace of her now by the Resistance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your analysis of the kind of — I don’t want to even say rise — of the kind of presence of Louise Mensch now in our lives in this country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> I think something very interesting happens with Trump, where he immediately absolves all these fucking monsters, be they David Frum or Louise Mensch. You know, look at stuff Louise Mensch has said about immigrants. Like, Jesus. It’s as bad as Trump. Sometimes even worse than things he’s said. I think that what goes on with some of these Resistance people is they don’t like that the mask is off with Trump, and they want to rehabilitate the neocons and just any more polite or well-read revanchists, like Mensch or someone. They want to go back to that being the opposition, because things were easy then. They could pretend like a lot of these systemic problems didn’t exist. And I think a lot of the most dumb shit they say is actually very instructive, like when they go, “Well, at least George Bush was a patriot.” What the fuck does that mean? What the fuck does that mean? Did — like Trump is going in there, and he’s like, “Well, time to destroy America.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Liberals love these intentions. They love saying that JFK didn’t really want to go in Vietnam, no matter what he actually did. They love saying that at least Bush cared, even despite the hundreds of thousands of dead bodies he piled up in the road that he paved for Trump. But they want that to be their opposition because they don’t like politics as a brutal contest of power and the allocation of resources.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and there’s that beautiful picture of Bush hugging Michelle Obama. I mean, you know, the other day, I tweeted, “I wonder which reprehensible Trump administration official will later, you know, lead the resistance?” And Eric Boehlert, who is, you know, one of the — he’s up there with Eric Garland from Media Matters — he of course didn’t quote tweet it because he didn’t want me to see the mention, but he screengrabbed my tweet, and then he said, you know, “I’m gonna get this one framed.” And then it had come into my timeline somehow, and I responded to him, you know, “You can frame it right next to your commemorative copy of David Frum’s Axis of Evil speech and one of George Bush’s paintings from your personal collection.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And it’s like, I mean, they really don’t get it. And then, you know, I was bombarded with people saying, you know, like, “Well, so what? We’re not supposed to welcome people like David Frum when they’re right about something?” And it’s — that is the — that’s the whole narrative. I mean, Dick Cheney is one of the most evil people to ever walk the globe, and he fucking literally shot someone in the face.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But it’s like, if Dick Cheney just sort of like inadvertently in passing made some critical remark of Trump, they would roll out the red carpet for him in the so-called Resistance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, and they don’t get it. They think that you’re saying like, everyone who opposes Trump is bad. When in reality, you’re of course saying, like, these associations — these people paved the path for Trump. They’ve done horrible things. They should probably be in fucking prison. Why are you rehabilitating them? This is not better than Trump, the person you’re associating with. But it’s like they have trouble comprehending that because politics isn’t policy, or allocation of resources, or power for them. It’s a set of manners and cultural signifiers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, for you to say that, they see that, and they’re like, “Oh, Jeremy, of course. The Intercept bros don’t get what politics is.” It’s when you go on an epic monologue against Trump and he’s not president anymore, and we have Orrin Hatch in there, who does largely the same shit, so — but then we feel better. They don’t get the cause and effect thing, because they think Trump’s an aberration. They think Trump’s an aberration, so they think any conservative that they pick is like — will bring us back to the path we should have been going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But since they’re completely revisionist in their understanding of history, and because they don’t see wars as being a moral problem. Which is really insane when you think about it. It used to be World War I and World War II and Vietnam, they sort of dispelled peoples’ notions of war as this noble enterprise. People always thought their country did the most moral things in war. But I think that because wealth is so stratified, and these people like a Bollier, or someone, they probably don’t know a lot of people who have had to go into the military because they couldn’t afford anything, because we mostly stick with people of our own classes now. We’re a very gilded age. And because we know so few people that went into war, and the voices who we do hear — what’s the liberal voice on the left? It’s someone who’s like, “I went to war, sir. Donald Trump, you didn’t serve your country, bitch. I did. I killed all these people.” Like, it’s — it’ll be like someone who went to Vietnam, and it’s like, why are we celebrating this? We did awful things over there. But they think war is like a noble pursuit, and that we do it morally.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And a scumbag in a coma is still a scumbag. And, you know, I think part of this sort of fake notion that when people die — I mean, I’ve joked on your show before that, you know, I want to do a segment on this called, “Piss on Their Graves,” like when Henry Kissinger dies. I mean, I don’t —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> He might outlive all of us, though, that fucker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] He could, yeah. He is like Yeltsin in a way. Well, Yeltsin, I think, is still — he and Ariel Sharon are in, like, the two cryogenic chambers next to each other.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Yeltsin was like pickled in alcohol, but Sharon was — he woke up from his coma that he got because he was just morbidly obese. And to celebrate it, like at the press conference they had at the hospital, he literally ate an entire bag of chips in front of reporters. And like, within weeks, went back in the coma. [Laughs] It was hilarious.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you make of this — the kind of politeness police are out in force because of this shooting that happened at the Republican practice for the Congressional baseball game? And, you know, Representative Scalise of course is a total scumbag on the core issues that lead to things —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Like mass shootings, but it’s like no one is allowed to point out the obvious, which is that the very policies on guns in particular that many of these Republicans hold, that that’s at the root of why these kinds of shootings happen and why he is in the condition that he’s in. The fact is that Paul Ryan and his cabal in the Congress, they love the idea that, you know, white men can have as many guns as they want in this country. I mean, what do you think about that concerned trolling from the establishment media on the issue of when bad people die or when they are critically injured?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> It’s funny how we’re pretending like everyone in Congress is brave, like we made them troops because one of those assholes got shot. Like, you didn’t even die. Like, why are we making them — they have healthcare and resources and protection none of us — most of us could never even fucking imagine. And I got quote tweeted, and the guy said, “Oh yeah, he deserves to die for being a Republican.” And I looked at who quoted me. It was a Nazi with a swastika avatar. [Laughs] I was like, “Yeah, that sucks when you make light of peoples’ deaths, serve harm to them. We should really be more civil.” But I think it has something to do with conceptions of violence, like, shit Scalise or Paul Ryan or Nancy Pelosi, for that matter, does to people. It’s violent. It’s violent to fucking rip away peoples’ healthcare, to make them go bankrupt to get care, to do all these massive wars, to make it easier for people who shouldn’t have guns to have guns, to militarize the police — all this shit that directly kills people. But because it’s politics, because we have this idea of politics as a civil enterprise with just competing cultural signifiers, we’re like, oh, it’s a game. The Republicans won the game this time, but that’s no reason you should hate them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, Trump’s a Russian traitor, but for some reason, the people in his party that enable him vote for his agenda, aren’t? I don’t know how that works, but we shouldn’t act like he’s some fucking hero or martyr for civility. He’s a piece of shit. He experienced the rational outcome of policies he has supported, and he regularly commits violence against millions of people. And I don’t really want anyone to die. I don’t want political assassinations. I think that’s bad. But the fuckin’ toothpaste is already out of the tube, so to speak. We live in a violent system. And yeah, you know what? We fuckin’ passed AHCA, which pieces of shit like Steve Scalise voted for. And the thought that you can — just having a fucking joint press conference with Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan, two people that everyone fucking despises —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nancy Pelosi:\u003c/strong> So, tomorrow, we’ll go out on the field. We’ll root for our team. We want everyone to do his or her very best. And we will use this occasion as one that brings us together and not separates us further.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Like that’s gonna bring civility back, when they — their future is gone. They’ll go bankrupt if they get a fucking MRI. And they can just buy a gun, but they can’t even see a therapist? Like that’s gonna do anything?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The story that you wrote about Saudi Arabia, which, you know, was excellent, came out —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Thank you. December, yeah. December of last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. It was called, “Your App Isn’t Helping the People of Saudi Arabia,” and you wrote that for Deadspin. And some people may have a cartoonish view of you. And I say cartoonish not in a demeaning way, but that they think that your entire existence is being funny or being a comedy writer, or, you know, your personality on Chapo Trap House. But you actually have an incredible depth of knowledge on conflicts in the Muslim and Arab world, and you have a particular interest in Saudi Arabia. First question is just like, how did that come about? It does really seem like a disconnect between the personality that are in some of what you do, and then you write like a really serious article about Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> People think that like, if you’re a very ironic person, it means you don’t give a shit about anything. And I think the total opposite is true. I think that some of the most compassionate people I’ve known, you barely ever see them make a serious post. And I’m not saying I’m one of them, but it’s like — it’s a way that you can look at the horribleness of the world and not drive yourself fucking insane. Like, if you can look at everything all the time and be totally serious, I kind of doubt how much you care, because it really is a bunch of awful shit to look at. But as far as, like, my interest in Saudi Arabia, well, I was — you know, I was a child during the Bush years, and there were all of those great pictures of King Fahd and Bush like kissing. It was in the news a lot. It was a huge thing in the news. It was just so fascinating. You know, you’re told that there are no real monarchies left. But there is this one that’s not just like a king with a fair bit of power, like Liechtenstein. It’s absolute, total control.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Foreign policy has always been more interesting to me, and because I think it’s a moral problem. I think it’s insane that we don’t think of the death and oppression that we enable and that we see all over the world as a moral problem. And I — just sort of by being online, and kids being savvy enough to use proxies and stuff, I’ve been lucky enough to meet the acquaintance of a lot of Saudis. And it’s easy to look at these countries, it’s easy to get in this trap of a sort of imperialist mindset, especially if you live in America, where you’re like, Saudi Arabia is evil. Most of the people there, they know what’s going on. When in reality, it’s a totalitarian state, and I’d say most of the people living there, that’s how they experience it. And it was, you know, something that happened in the last three years. Talking to these people made me see the reality and nonstop horror and fear that they live in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it started out as a thing about how I noticed that a lot of like Gulf accounts would dox people. Would dox people who were atheist or migrant workers. And it became, just from talking to them — they were the — peoples’ lives were really fuckin’ sad. There’s very little writing about what peoples’ lives are like over there. It was really heartbreaking. A lot of these kids who have to hide their identities to even talk about their identities as LGBT, or religious minorities, or atheists, or especially migrant workers. That’s the worst thing you can be over there: a migrant worker who speaks out. They’re often suicidal. They don’t feel like they can trust anyone. It’s a fucking awful existence. They’re often just killed by sometimes family members or the state, or just any extralegal process.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, you go to their pages. It’s not like, you know, fuck me, what is the point of my life? Which is completely understandable. Like, I feel like I would do that. But you go to them, and it’s just all solidarity. It’s solidarity with the Palestinians. It’s solidarity with black Americans being killed by the police. And it’s like, even under their experience, they see that these struggles are interconnected, and that all oppression is interconnected, and that they would have every right in the world to just talk about their situation. But they don’t. It made me want to kind of tell their story, because it is — as horrible and sad as it is, and how much it makes you feel about your own country because we’ve backed so much of this up, it also does kind of make you feel hopeful that even in a — where they don’t even really have full Internet access, can see the world in a much clearer vision than a lot of people here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Final question. Do you think Trump is — is he gonna finish a term as president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Ah, that’s a good question. I mean, I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Not really, but go ahead. You can answer it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> No, I mean, like it’s — I oscillated on it. I oscillated on it. Any week you ask. Like, you remember when he was — right before he went to Saudi Arabia, and it’s like everything happened? It was right after Comey, Jared. They hit Jared with a backchannel to the Russians shit. And he tweets out like, “It’s almost time for my big trip.” [Laughs] “Protecting Americans’ interests is what I like to do.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> And it was just like very normal. “I’m a normal president, everybody. Everything’s going great.” Now, when I saw that, I was like, oh, he’s fucked. He’s gonna like, not be president on the flight back to America. But he just — he has a way of like, surviving. And I think that — I don’t know. I think he hates doing it. Every time you see him talk about Hillary, you have to think, like, he’s doing that because he’s so mad he has to do this job. He doesn’t want to do this shit. But he’s a quitter, but he’s also like a very spiteful person, so I think that he thinks if he quits, everyone’s gonna be like, “Ah, I told you he’s a fuckin’ — he’s full of shit. He’s not gonna do anything.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think for Trump, it’s a contest between the two things. How stymied is he gonna get by all the fucking weird liars he hired, who — like Flynn, Jared, who, you know, even if there’s not like a Louise Mensch, she’s a Russian deep cell agent. There is something weird going on. Just, you get enough compromised people, something weird will go on. And how spiteful he is for everyone he feels like has doubted him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I don’t know what will win out. He’s — I think its’ wrong to say he’s lazy, but he’s not good at the hard work he does unless it’s building buildings. And I can see him rationalizing it in his mind, like yeah, “I actually — I did everything I wanted to do. And then like, all my enemies got back at me at once.” I think it would be funniest if he quits like six months from now, it’s Pence, and then he primaries Pence in 2020. That would be the best outcome. It would be the funniest shit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Ah, Chelsea’ll beat ‘em both anyway.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, yeah. Well, Chelsea unity ticket to unify the left.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Chelsea Manning and Chelsea Clinton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, Felix, thanks so much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FB:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.

President Trump once said that when it comes to health insurance, he would cover everyone. He lied. Meanwhile the crown prince of America, Jared Kushner, and Mohammed Bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, play house with foreign policy. This week on the podcast: Intercept columnist and Al Jazeera host Mehdi Hasan fills in for Jeremy Scahill. With the Muslim travel ban heading to the Supreme Court, Intercept reporter Murtaza Hussain and Palestinian author and journalist Rula Jebreal discuss the global consequences of the House of Trump’s meddling in the Middle East. British historian Tom Holland joins Mehdi for a heated debate on the role of Islam within the Islamic State — is religion the motivation behind terrorist attacks, or is it merely used as a justification after the fact?

Up until last week, in fact, there had never been a single poll, which showed a majority of Americans supported Obamacare.

The level of yawn-inducing technical terms associated with the healthcare debate in this country is just astonishing, as is the lack of imagination.

Everyone else in the Western world has managed to pull it off without the kind of controversy and divisiveness we see here in the U.S. I’m from the U.K. — maybe the accent gave me away — where the government-funded National Health Service, the NHS, is more popular with the British public than both the Royal Family and the Armed Forces. And I’m convinced that’s because it’s always been clear to the British public what the NHS is and what it stands for. It was founded in 1948 on three core principles: that it meets the needs of everyone; that it be free at the point of delivery; and that it be based on need, not ability to pay. So, you even have conservative prime ministers in the U.K. like David Cameron forced to sing its praise.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>David Cameron:\u003c/strong> Conservatives rely on the NHS, work in the NHS, volunteer to help the NHS up and down the country.

Why is healthcare such an —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Unbelievably complex subject.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> If the rest of the industrialized countries can guarantee healthcare to all their citizens, why can’t the United States? If the rest of the West treats healthcare as a right, not a privilege, why doesn’t the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We have a failing healthcare.

But we’re going to have great healthcare.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> If Australia and Canada and the U.K. can offer viable and popular models of free healthcare for all, why shouldn’t the United States? Now, Republicans may have been forced to postpone a vote on their healthcare bill, but Donald Trump has already had his big win of the week. On Monday, the Supreme Court voted unanimously to bring back a partial version of his travel ban until they’re ready to adjudicate on the whole thing in October. You remember the travel ban. It’s the Muslim ban which Trump says isn’t a Muslim ban, even though he’s the one who said this just 18 months ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and completely shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. [Crowd cheering]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Now, a lot of defenders of the ban say it can’t be a Muslim ban because so many Muslim majority countries are excluded from it. But that raises another issue. If national security and counterterrorism are what’s behind this ban, why are countries like Saudi Arabia, which produced 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11, not on the ban list too?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Joining me to discuss this are Rula Jebreal, foreign policy analyst, journalist, best-selling author, who’s in Beirut; and The Intercept’s very own Murtaza Hussain, who’s in New York. Murtaza, Rula, thanks for joining me on Intercepted. Murtaza, the travel ban is partially back. Not fully back. It’s gonna be adjudicated on in October, say the Supreme Court. What’s gonna happen in October? There’s gonna be a lot of activism, I know, especially from critics of the ban, which President Trump is now calling a suspension in his latest statement. What’s gonna happen come October, do you think?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza Hussain:\u003c/strong> Well, as you recall, when the ban was first rolled out, there were huge protests at airports. Very inspiring scenes, which went viral throughout the world and actually pushed back against the narrative that the United States is defined by this administration. Clearly, as people showed, it was not. I think what you’ll see now, given that there’s quite a lot of lead time before the ban is litigated again, is you’ll see a lot of legal activism. Already lawyers and legal NGOs are preparing to challenge the ban strictly on judicial grounds. But it remains to be seen how they’ll rule in the end. We still have a lot of time at that period, and a lot could happen between now and then, too. Things could happen. There could be a terrorist attack, which Trump makes — uses to politicize the entire process around whether they get the ban.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Or they could lose a justice from the Supreme Court between now and then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Absolutely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Anthony Kennedy, the famous swing voter on the court, is considering quitting too. So lucky, old Donald Trump — another gift for him. He may get to appoint yet another Supreme Court justice in his first year in office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Right. And we can expect that that justice will not be someone who’s favorable to progressive views —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] I think that’s an understatement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Rula, how disappointed were you by Monday morning’s Supreme Court decision?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rula Jebreal:\u003c/strong> I am currently on — in Beirut. Yesterday, I spent the day on the Syrian/Lebanese border with refugees in one of the I , 200 refugee camps. And I spent the day with children, with women, with orphans, with widows. They were horrified, obviously, and they couldn’t understand why they were on the travel ban while their country for years had financed extremists to fight the regime, and while they couldn’t understand why themselves were on the ban. They felt that they were the victim. They feel that the world has abandoned them. But above all, they feel — they don’t understand why other countries, the countries that gave the United States 15 of the 19 hijackers, Saudi Arabia, is not on the ban. What I saw, a lot of resentment towards the United States, resentment towards the people who did nothing, not even lifted one finger, to help them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Murtaza, Rula mentioned kind of the stats and then the number of people who’ve been doing some of the killings and where they’re from. It’s a fact, isn’t it, that from these six countries on the travel ban, that Syria, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, and Libya, not a single national from any of these countries has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Right. That’s what makes it so risible, the idea that this is about security. It’s clearly not about security. So, I think the better way to look at this is a travel ban or a Muslim ban, it’s a ban of Muslims, as Trump promised in his election campaign, but only Muslims we can afford to ban. So, the ones —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Who are not buying tons of our weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Not —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Arash Karami the Al-Monitor journalist, tweeted earlier this week, “It’s not a Muslim ban, it’s a Muslim countries that don’t buy weapons from the U.S. ban.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Right, exactly. Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JR:\u003c/strong> Exactly. Precisely. If Americans think that this is about national security, they are delusional. Trump is basically sending a message: “I don’t want the poor. I don’t want these countries that are war zone.” But what you are doing, you are gifting these kids to all these radical groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> And you mentioned kind of the massive refugee crisis there is in the world. I saw a stat earlier this week that the United States has taken in 50 percent, I believe, fewer refugees than they did previously under Trump. In fact, it was a Trump official, one of his social media guys, who was trumpeting this fact on social media, that — Murtaza, they just don’t care, do they? I mean, in a sense, you and me and Rula and others can kind of, you know, gnash our teeth and wail about how unfair it all is, but for these guys, it just bounces off. I mean, for them, it’s great. Yeah, we’re not taking any refugees, and who cares?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H\u003c/strong>: No, they’re reveling in the fact that they’re not taking any refugees, which — it’s really disappointing. It’s sort of the abdication of the at least stated role that the United States has aspired to over the past several decades of being welcoming towards refugees. Even very conservative administrations like Ronald Reagan’s administration had a very forthcoming and welcoming policy towards refugees because they saw it as a justification for American exceptionalism and a sign of American confidence and strength. I think that as that confidence has decreased, there’s been greater insularity. There’s been greater paranoia. And now it’s manifested in this administration, which is extremely xenophobic and extremely hostile to very poor, weak, and desperate people — the people America normally gets prestige out of helping. It’s making a show out of humiliating and adding to these peoples’ woe, and I think it’s a sign of general malaise in the political climate in the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump makes you miss Ronald Reagan, eh? That speaks volumes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> [Laughs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Rula, is this a Muslim ban? Because a lot of people would say, well, it’s not a Muslim ban because it’s only a minority of Muslims in the world who are being targeted by it. What would you say to them?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Yeah, of course it’s a Muslim ban. It’s an absolute Muslim ban. This is a war on diversity and on otherness. And it starts with the poor, it starts with the refugees. It starts on every level. Even the healthcare bill, it’s resemble — something like banning them from hospitals. Now they’re banning basically simple poor people who are desperate from war zones to enter America. This has nothing to do with national security. This has all to do with white supremacists.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> And Murtaza, this is gonna be just talking about the Supreme Court. Rula mentioned the court. The ban itself is partially revived. It’s not a full ban. It’s a ban on anyone who cannot prove or have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. If you’re related to someone in the U.S., if you have a job offer from someone in the U.S., or you’re gonna be a student at a university in the U.S., you should still be able to get in from one of those six countries in theory, though it’s gonna be a bureaucratic nightmare, isn’t it, Murtaza?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. And as we saw with the first rollout of the ban, whole categories of people were targeted who technically, according to the letter of the law, somewhat ambiguous, but they should not have been targeted. And things are articulated at a legal level, but the implementation for people on — you know, at customs and airports, and how they actually carry out this policy, could be very different. And it’s gonna be a huge nightmare and headache for a lot of people. But more importantly, regardless of, you know, some people are able to — will be able to get in. The most vulnerable people will not, refugees. Secondly, it just sends the same message to the world that America is no longer a welcoming place to vast swaths of the planet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Which is a deeply depressing message. Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the justices who wanted to bring back the whole ban, not just a partial ban — he wrote that, you know, people would try and get around this with fake relationships, which is always a worry on the right. That people would try to have fake relationships to try and get ‘round this executive order. And I’m kind of thinking about the whole debate in the ‘80s and ‘90s about green cards, which you’ll remember well. Do you remember the movie “Green Card” with Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Green Card Trailer:\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Narrator:\u003c/strong> Two total strangers who entered into a marriage of convenience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Female Speaker:\u003c/strong> I now pronounce you man and wife.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> Brontë, is this true?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Andie MacDowell:\u003c/strong> Yes, but it’s not the way you think.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Narrator:\u003c/strong> They thought they’d never have to see each other again, until.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> I’m with the investigation department of the INS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Andie MacDowell:\u003c/strong> The what?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Speaker:\u003c/strong> The immigration service.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Narrator:\u003c/strong> The government changed everything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Are we gonna have a Hollywood version of that called “The Muslim Ban,” where someone tries to get married to try and get ‘round coming in from Syria? Or, I mean, we can laugh about this, but as you say, millions of people are heavily affected by this. It’s gonna be a lot of innocent people who are gonna be blocked from coming into the U.S. And Trump, by the way, guys, is emboldened. I mean, he’s put out a statement saying he’s delighted by all this. You know, he used to call judges, “so-called judges,” but I’m sure he’s very, very, very, very pleased with this Supreme Court verdict.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Yeah, the United States, it’s no more the country of “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Actually, the United States slogan today should be, “Give me your white, give me your money, give me your, your wealth, give me your weapons,” and give me what makes Donald Trump very, very pleased, and that’s all — what is it about? It’s pleasing a thug and a tyrant who is sitting in the White House and has no clue how this will actually embolden extremists and tyrant in the Middle East who will use this to crack down even more, further on their people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Had the ban not been brought back, a lot of people on the left were worried that if there was a terrorist attack in the U.S., and thank God, there hasn’t been once since Trump was elected president — not by Muslims, anyways. Had there been a terrorist attack by “jihadists,” he would have said, “See? It’s because you didn’t allow me my ban.” Now, God forbid, if there’s a terrorist attack, what’s he — who’s he gonna blame it on next? Because he’s got his — he’s got his — is he gonna say because it was a partial ban, this happened?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Barack Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Barack Obama, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yeah, okay. That’s always the fallback.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> He’s kind of got a win-win situation because of this because as you said, if the ban had not been in place, he could say, well, because the ban was stopped, this happened. But if the ban is in place, which it is now, at least partially, he can say, “Well, actually, the ban is not enough. This proves that we need even harsher policies to stop this threat because the ban as it currently exists didn’t stop it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Or if there isn’t an attack, he can say, “See, it’s because of the ban, see?” He wins — he wins in lots of scenarios, sadly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> He wins in any scenario. And only because he’s able to package it in a certain way, which he undoubtedly will do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> How much of the reason for the Saudis, or the Egyptians, or the Pakistanis — I mean, let’s not forget, the San Bernardino attacker was from Pakistan. How is it that these countries have been able to stay off all of these lists and bans and sanctions, even though, you know, to the naked eye, they look like they’re more connected to “terrorist” groups and terrorist ideologies in some of the countries on this ban? How have they managed to pull that off? Because they’re of geopolitical value, or because they’re good at lobbying in D.C., or what?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Well, I think first and foremost, the seven countries which were targeted were countries identified by Obama for stricter entry and exit protocols, even before Trump came to office. So, they’re very much low-hanging fruit. The infrastructure was already there to target these countries. They have hostile relations with the United States and so forth. Other countries, you know — it was said, around the time the ban was first being debated by Trump’s DHS head that, you know, we will add further countries going down the line. So, I wouldn’t actually say that these countries are not gonna be targeted in the future. They’ve indicated they —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Oh, come on, Murtaza. Saudi Arabia’s never gonna be put on any ban list. You know that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H\u003c/strong>: Saudi Arabia, no. But Pakistan, for instance, or, you know —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ\u003c/strong>: Not even Pakistan, actually. This is — I know for sure from my conversation with many people in the region, especially in the Gulf, the Pakistani — their name was in the first list. They called Mattis, General Mattis, and they called some people in the Pentagon, and they promised them, if there name will be on the list, they will basically ban America from using any operation, any base in Pakistan, or even will cooperate with them on anything. So, basically, they were bullied into taking off that name. That has happened. So, Syria has no way to bully Trump or to pay him. Yemen has no way to bully Trump or to pay him. All these other countries that are on the ban, they are not with — they don’t have any capabilities. They don’t have any military bases. They don’t have any Trump Towers or Trump Hotels. They don’t have any leverage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Although, Rula, Qatar has a — one of the biggest U.S. military bases in the world. Well, in the region, at least. CENTCOM in Doha, I think 10,000 troops. And yet, that didn’t stop Trump from throwing Qatar under the bus when the Saudis asked him to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Yeah, but basically, there’s — and this exposes how dumb the president of the United States, and ignorant, and how the Saudis are very good at, and they played him. He was manipulated, big-time, by the Saudis. While they were dancing with the swords, they basically, they were deciding at that time that Qatar has to become a province of Saudi Arabia. Not because Qatar has done anything out of the usual, but because simply, they have different views. Who killed the Arab Spring? And the principal of the Arab Spring were Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. The whole idea of freedom, democracy, and social justice, they hated it so much that they poured millions of dollars to basically overthrow Morsi in Egypt, and basically shut down. Otherwise, the demands on that list that they sent to Qatar wouldn’t be demands about deporting individual editors and shutting down Al Jazeera. It’s about shutting down free speech and every reformist in the region. That what is it about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Well, they have this super competent new Crown Prince. We’re told in the U.S. media, in the op-ed pages of the Washington Post and the New York Times, that he’s this brilliant young man, 31-year-old Mohammad Bin Salman, MBS. He’s gonna privatize the entire Saudi economy. He’s gonna rejuvenate the kingdom. He’s probably gonna let women drive as soon as he’s king. He’s gonna lead a new pro-Western alliance in the region. What do you say to those op-ed writers who tell us such good things about this new Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> Well, you know, under his guidance, he’s been leading the Yemen War, but he’s also been tasked with putting together this alliance. He’s been so bad at allegedly getting Sunni Muslims on Saudi Arabia’s side that the only two countries which are really on their side are the Emirates and Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Murtaza H:\u003c/strong> This is the Sunni alliance of these two countries, for the most part.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Israel’s a new honorary Sunni country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> The Muslim NA— they call it the Sunni NATO. Israel, the Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. If I may jump in on this —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH\u003c/strong>: Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Young, as they call him, brilliant. I don’t know how did they assess his brilliance, since he’s only a 31-year-old, and for two years, he waged wars that destabilized further the region and emboldened more and more al Qaeda and their affiliate. But regarding this prince, usually — and this is what always happen. Usually, there is an established relationship between the Crown Prince and the Pentagon. They usually study abroad. This guy never studied abroad. This guy basically had a personal relationship with Jared Kushner. This is how America’s foreign policy is decided today. If the king, basically the ruler —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> The house of Trump and the house of Saud.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ: \u003c/strong>Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH\u003c/strong>: It’s two families.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> The ruling family in America and the ruling family in Saudi Arabia get along?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Prince Jared and Prince Mohamed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ: \u003c/strong>Exactly. Then basically, things can be done and changed. But it’s opening up basically some kind of Game of Thrones in Saudi Arabia and the war that they are waging outside. There’s also a war at home. The reality of this Crown Prince, two years ago, when somebody was asking about women driving, he said, “Oh yeah, the country is not ready yet.” And I remember very well, people were mocking him on social media. And that’s why now you go to prison if you mock this guy on social media in the Emirates and in Saudi Arabia. And they would say, “Well, dude, welcome to the 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup> century. Take your time.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Rula, Jared Kushner, the prince from the house of Trump, was visiting the Middle East last week. He sat down with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel. He went and saw President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority. Reports later emerged that it was a very awkward meeting between Kushner and Abbas. There was talk that even — that Trump doesn’t want to do Middle East peace anymore since Kushner came back from the region. What on earth was a 36-year-old former property developer, son-in law of the President, whose family are invested in illegal settlements in the West Bank — what on earth is he doing acting as a peace envoy for the United States of America?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Well, actually, my Palestinian sources tell me that he was acting as he was Bibi’s spokesperson and advisor. He was basically telling the Palestinian, already discredited, Authority that they need to capitulate totally, allow more settlements, and allow Israel to do whatever they wanted in the occupied territory, and they basically need to give up and recognize the Jewish state. Not even Israel, which, you know, the Palestinian Authority recognized Israel already in the ‘80s. But they want — he was insisting on recognizing it as a Jewish state. The argument against the Jewish state is not only Jews are living inside Israel. There’s two million Palestinians who are citizens. So, what he wanted, basically to create a system where we, as Palestinians, Israelis, we consider ourself second and third-class citizens. And we not only accept and embrace it in favor of a superior race called the Jewish majority — this is what ended the conversation between Abbas and Jared Kushner. And I think Abbas, who was delusional for two seconds thinking that Trump might really want to go and want to have some kind of a legacy in the history as the man that brokered the peace deal, understood that it was a game. And he should have understood it way before.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But Rula, how many times — how many times will Palestinian leaders go to the United States or welcome envoys from the United States and assume that anything’s actually going to change?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Well, until we have this corrupt, inept, old authority that is the kind of way they think.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> In the West Bank.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Because in the West Bank, exactly, they’re really still thinking that the United States is a fair broker. Somehow, someday, one day, somebody will come. They have no other leverage. The only leverage as Palestinians, and they know it. The Israelis, and that’s why they’re insisting on the Jewish state. The only leverage, it’s one country already. We know that. The fight should be for equal rights. One man, one vote. Israel wants to be called democracy, not tribal state like Saudi Arabia and other areas, or not ethnocracy, or not apartheid, as recently —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> You’re saying push — you’re saying push for a one binational state for everyone to live in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> One binational state full of rights for everybody. And guess what? Actually, Trump is our ally in this. If he wants one state, I think we should take it. I want one state too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But he said that at that press conference with Netanyahu in the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Exactly. And Netanyahu, I think — sorry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Didn’t he say, “I’m not bothered whether it’s two states or one state?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Exactly. And he — but Netanyahu was — I’m sure he had nightmares after that, thinking, oh my god, this guy is so crazy that he’s willing to push for that idea. But what Netanyahu and Trump were not talking about, and this is the thing that’s being discussed now. And somebody should have raised it with Kushner. Fine, you wanted to recognize Israel and tell Israelis to take it all? Take it all, my darling. However, give us our voting rights. Give us equality. Give us democracy. I want to see this administration saying no to that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH\u003c/strong>: Rula Jebreal, Murtaza Hussein, than you for being on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RJ:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having us.

And that’s the truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> The British writer and historian Tom Holland has a more measured and nuanced approach, but someone might say his own argument about the links between ISIS and Islam are not that dissimilar to those deployed by FOX News types.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tom Holland:\u003c/strong> We have seen the Islamic state in Syria and Iraq draw on scripture to justify maimings, beheadings, slavery, and genocide. We have seen cartoonists murdered in Paris on a charge of insulting Mohammed. And of course, we have the persistent and steady drumbeat in the back of our heads of Islamist plots constantly being foiled.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Holland also says jihadists see themselves as devout Muslims, as “paragons of righteous behavior.” I spoke to Tom Holland recently, and began by asking him how he squares his view with the many real world examples of ISIS fighters in France, in Belgium, in the U.K. who were petty criminals, drug dealers, addicts, with the two guys from Birmingham, England who bought “Islam for Dummies” and “The Koran for Dummies” before going out to fight in Syria, with ISIS’s own leaked recruitment documents, which show a whopping 70 percent of recruits have any knowledge of Islam whatsoever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tom Holland:\u003c/strong> Often, particularly the Western fighters, the narrative is that they were lost, that they were smoking weed that they were fighting, that they were sleeping around. And then suddenly, they had this transformative understanding of God’s purpose. And that’s an absolutely familiar narrative, not just from Islam, from Christianity, from all kinds of conversion. That they were lost and they were found — Amazing Grace. I mean it’s the same kind of idea. So, of course, if you believe that God has saved you, of course you’re going to go and try and find out about God, and try and find out more about it. But if we’re talking about Islamic state, the Western fighters are a minority. The driving force is very much from the Levant, from the Middle East.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yes, but the study I cited, Tom, was not about Western fighters. It was about ISIS recruits in general, are not the most informed of —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Okay. Well, you’re asking how do I — how do I — what evidence do I have? What evidence do I have? I recently — I made a film that was for Channel 4 here in Britain that was broadcast a couple of weeks ago called “The Origins of Violence.” And what I was interested in, one of the questions that I was asking in that, was why Christians and Yazidis were treated differently by ISIS? And so, I went to the frontline, and I spoke to Christians and to Yazidis who has been — had dealings with ISIS. And I spoke to a Yazidi woman who said that, as she was raped, an Iraqi ISIS fighter quoted the sword verse at her as a justification for what he was doing. Now, it’s perfectly possible to say that that is, you know, a grotesque spin on it. Nevertheless, we wanted to hear from someone who could speak, if not for ISIS, then from the Salafi jihadist tradition. And so, we interviewed a man called Abu Sayyaf, who is a leading Salafist in Jordan. He was in prison with al Zarqawi who many people say was the founder of ISIS. And —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Who was also a thug, not a scholar of any kind.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yes, absolutely a thug. But Abu Sayyaf is indeed a scholar. And almost every phrase that he has echoes hadiths, echoes phrases from the Koran. And I asked him — you know, I told him what the Yazidi woman had said, and I asked him, “were ISIS justified in killing Yazidi men and enslaving Yazidi women?” And he said, no, they weren’t. And I thought, oh, well, that’s cleared up. And he said, “They weren’t because they were not justified in calling the Caliphate.” And so, then I said, “Well, if they — you know, if the Caliphate was justified, then would they be justified in treating the Yazidis as they did?” And he said, “Absolutely,” and he referred to them as \u003cem>mushrikeen\u003c/em>, equating them with the Ayatollahs of Mecca, and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But Tom, I’m not disputing that there people out there who hold these horrific views.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> But Mehdi, he could not be more Islamic. I mean, this is a scholar who’s devoted his life —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Well, no. Come on, Tom. Tom, I’ve read — I’ve read your articles where you say that Western leaders and politicians should not pronounce on what is and what isn’t Islamic, and now you’re telling me that some “jihadi scholar” that you met could not be more Islamic. What qualifies you to say that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, the fact that he’s devoted his entire life to the study of Islam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> [Laughs] Well, so have lots of people. You know very well, Tom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, listen, so, Mehdi, what’s —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> I don’t need to read to you the various statements of scholars from Al-Azhar, from Saudi Arabia, from Salafist Saudi Arabia, from across the world, who’ve universally denounced ISIS’s interpretation of Islam. My point is more about the motivations, to come back to the fighter you mentioned who cited the Koran as he raped an innocent woman. Disgusting behavior. But I wouldn’t disagree with your description of it as a justification. I think you and I can agree he’s using it to justify his crimes. But of course, every kind of “terrorist” has some sort of justification. That doesn’t mean it’s why they do it. You know, people go out and commit horrible acts, horrible violence, and unless you’re a psychopath, you don’t want to admit that you’re doing it for no reason, or because you’re a violent person. You want to give it some moral patina. You want to give it some justification after the event. So, that’s my point about the people not — you know, your point about reading the text and going out. I’m saying my position is: That they’re not religious before they get there, as it were. They’re not interested in the actual religion, or the beliefs, or the theology. But once they’re doing what they’re doing, of course they’re gonna look for justifications after the event. And most terrorism scholars, Tom, as you know, don’t say that religion or theology is the main motivating factor. They do cite it in much more to do with identity crises and social factors and political factors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, these — the fighters in ISIS are drawing on the Koran, are drawing on the example of Mohammed, not because these are definitive understandings of them, not because — of course, I entirely accept that they are — Muslims around the world are appalled by them. Nevertheless, there is —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> It’s not just they’re appalled, Tom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, but —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Sorry, go on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> I think the issue here is what we mean by Islam. I think — I mean, I think that if you are a Muslim, as you are, you have a sense of Islam as something that exists in a kind of ideal form, maybe in the mind of God. That there is such a thing as real Islam, as true Islam, as authentic Islam. I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> The normative Islam, I think is a fair way of describing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> No, no. Okay, but the moment you say normative, there also — that also implies that there are kind of heretical forms, that there are extreme forms, but they’re still Islamic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yeah, and that’s why I wouldn’t say that they’re — I’ve never been one of those who says ISIS has nothing to do with Islam. I don’t think either of us disagree that they draw on the Koran or they draw on scripture. I don’t think that’s the argument. I — my point is, the motivating factor, what’s leading people to join ISIS, what’s helped the rise of ISIS — if you want to defeat ISIS, religion is not the arena where the debate should be taking place. For example, if it’s about religion and a religious ideology, why didn’t ISIS arise in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim country in the world? Why didn’t it arise in Saudi Arabia, the most Salifist, most ideological Muslim country in the world? There’s a reason why it was born in Iraq and Syria, two countries ravaged by war, misgovernance, foreign intervention, all sorts of horrors, which produces horrific groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, I don’t dispute that. And I mean — and the point is that if you are going through turmoil through — whether it be on the geopolitical level or on the individual level, the ideology that you reach for to clothe what may be your resentments, your anger, your frustrations, is incredibly telling. These people are not, for instance, turning to Marxism. They are not turning to nationalism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But hold on. On that very note — on that very note, it’s interesting you should raise Marxism. And you talked earlier on about, you know, transformation and being born again. The argument of a lot of terrorism acts — so, people like Olivier Roy, who I’m sure you know in France, who says, “This is not the radicalization of Islam. This is the Islamicization of radicalism.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> His argument is that, you know, modern jihadist terrorism has nothing to do with, you know, the Ottoman Empire or the history of Wahhabism. It actually shares a lot in common with modern forms of dissent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> He says, “It’s an avatar of ultra-leftist radicalism in many ways.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yes, but — yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Targeting U.S. imperialism. You know, the same people who are going out to fight the jihad, a lot of them are converts, Tom, as you know. White converts to Islam. 20, 30 years ago, they may have joined socialist or communist groups. A hundred years ago, they would have joined anarchist groups. We’ve always had violent young men who are looking to justify their violence —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> In ideological terms.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> But why are they not now? And what is it within Islam that is so appealing to them? Why are they not converting to Christianity? Why are they — What is it within Islam — which is specifically —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But Tom, that works both ways. Why is it only happening now? Why is ISIS not around 100, 200, 300, 400 years ago?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Why is this some very modern phenomenon to do with the crisis in the Middle East, very much so?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Okay. Well, this sense of there being a crisis, and that people look back to the beginnings of Islam to try and find a solution to the crisis that they face is one that has been ongoing for 300 years. And obviously, whenever there is a particular crisis, so there is a particular spike in this kind of response to it. And so, ISIS is very distinctively 21\u003csup>st\u003c/sup> century, yes. But it is also, it seems to me, part of a continuum that reaches at least back to the 18\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> century. Why is it happening now? Well, it’s happening now because, as you said, Iraq and Syria —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Politics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Are —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Politics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yes, yes, but politics is the incubator of religious convulsion, of religious reform and upheaval and transformation. I think a further aspect, which I think fascinatingly provides an echo of the Christian Reformation, is that the spike in jihadism eerily coincides with the rise of the Internet. And what the Internet has done is to make accessible in a multitude of vernaculars, not just the Koran, but vast collections of hadiths. And so essentially, people who, as you say, are not scholars, but who want to justify what they do, can go online and can look stuff up, and can find anything — and the parallel there —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yes, that’s true. Although on the other hand, again, I would remind you that a lot of the — no, I agree with that. That is true. There’s definitely a kind of cut and paste Koran. I always point out that Islamophobes and jihadists have a lot in common. They both kind of selectively quote scripture with no actual basis in scholarship. But one thing I would add to that, I would go a step further and say, okay, that’s true in some cases. But what about the evidence which I cited at the start, and I’ll cite again as we come to a close, which is a lot of these people who you’re saying, you know, they’re going online and all that, there’s actually not that much evidence that they are interested in the actual religious arguments. You know, Demos, the British think tank, did a two-year study of convicted terrorists in Britain and Canada, and they found that not only do they have shallow conception of Islam, their degree of interest “in the actual teachings of the Koran was fairly minimal.” And this is what I’m trying to get to with you. Could we at least agree that, okay, the founders of ISIS, the Baghdadis of the world, they may or may not be interested in some hadith from the seventh century —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, he has —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But the recruits, the foot soldiers —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> I mean, let’s remember, he has a doctorate in Islamic studies. I mean, he —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Oh, come on, Tom. His doctorate is — do you know what his doctorate’s in? Do know what his PhD is in? I always hear this Baghdadi has a PhD. Do you know what it’s in, Tom?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Tell me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> It’s in — his PhD is in a poem about how to read the Koran. It’s not in any kind of serious scholarship. It’s from the university in Iraq that no one had ever heard of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, it sounds quite Islamic to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Until the invasion of Iraq. I mean, and most of the founding fathers of jihadism, as you know, were not Islamic scholars. Bin Laden’s an engineer. Zawahiri’s a doctor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yes, yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Hassan al-Banna was a teacher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Yes, yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Sayyid Qutb was in education. That’s the truth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> And the echo there is absolutely of the Protestant Reformation, in which the leaders of the Protestant Reformation were tinkers, were tailors, were people who were regarded by the cardinals, by the theologians of the Catholic church with utter contempt because they were absolutely not familiar with these great traditions that the church had taught over many centuries. The situation is exactly analogous. But these jihadi leaders, and indeed, many of the foot soldiers, their response to that is to turn ‘round and say, “Well, look what your scholarship has done. Look where it has led Islam. That’s why we need to pull down this cladding. We need to trample down the nettles, and we need to get back to the unadulterated, unadorned primal Islam” —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But Tom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Of Mohammed —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But Tom, sorry to cut you off.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> And the ancestors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> The point I was trying to make is maybe we can find some common ground. Would you at least agree at the organizations, their leaders on the ground, the Baghdadis of this world, may be interested in scripture and religion, etc., in some shape or form, but there’s a separation between them and the recruits, who are clearly, at least to my mind, the guys you’re seeing blowing stuff up in Paris or London, have every little interest in, very little knowledge in, very little background in the faith? Could we at least separate those two things out? Would you agree that that’s a fair division?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> I absolutely agree that they are ignorant and contemptuous of everything that makes Islamic civilization so potent, so beautiful, so inspiring. They do not care about that. What they are drawing on is, I think, a form of mingled supremacism and self-pity. And they cite verses — absolutely, again, I agree, out of context, maybe. But they cite verses that justify them as warriors of God, and particularly as superior to non-Muslims. And this seems to me the concept that is absolutely key to the foot soldiers, many of whom are deracinated, from immigrant backgrounds, feel alienated, obviously, from the mainstream societies in which they live. What they are getting is a sense of themselves as Muslims being superior to non-Muslims. And when that curdles and goes peculiarly toxic, it ends up giving them the sense that they are justified in killing non-Muslims, and that this will get them to heaven. And I have no doubt that the murderers who ran amok in London on London Bridge and in Borough Market believe that they’re going to heaven. I have no doubt that the guy who blew up young girls at a pop concert in Manchester thought as he pulled the trigger that he is going to heaven. That seems to be an utterly —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> But let me ask you this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> An utterly religious and indeed Islamic motivation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Let me ask you this as a final question. If it is — if it is a religious motivation, if it is a religious debate in a religious context that we need to acknowledge much more, what would need to change? Let’s say — let’s say we concede, yes, it’s Islam. I agree with you that Islam’s to blame, Islam’s the driver. A version of Islam is at the core of all of this. What would you change? What would you expect Muslims to do to prevent this kind of violence from happening?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, I [laughs] I don’t know because I think that, you know, you look at the Christian Reformation. It took about two centuries for it to blow itself out. I think that no solution to this is going to be adequate that does not draw on what is noblest and most specific within Islam itself. And, you know, your anger, your pain at this is absolutely expressive of that. But I think that that can only be put to that end if it is first acknowledged that these guys are authentically expressive of religious motivation and religious traditions, because only when you acknowledge the sickness can you go about finding the cure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> No, I agree. I agree with that. It’s just that where we disagree is on the sickness. I think acknowledging that is difficult for a lot of us who look at the evidence and don’t see the religious motivations, and don’t see the religious justifications as any kind of genuine justifications. And my worry is — my worry is that, you know, we all go on about religion, religion, religion, and meanwhile, all of those political incubators that you mentioned or ignored, which are the real drivers of all of this. And we — and we are distracted from the problem at hand, and the threat actually grows while we pointlessly talk about reforming in Islam, which has already been reformed in many ways. And some would argue that ISIS is a product of various reformations of Islam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Well, I think — I think, you know, if we’re talking about the Reformation in the Protestant sense, I think that ISIS are absolutely expressive of a reformation in that sense. But can I just — I mean, from a personal level, I am from a Christian background. And one of the things that I find incredibly painful is the role that the Gospels played in the Holocaust that — that’s not to say that they were responsible, but clearly, the strain of anti-Semitism that was a part of the church’s teachings and which derived from the very core of the New Testament was something that Christians in the wake of the Holocaust had to face up to. And both the Catholic Church and most of the Protestant churches made an effort in the wake of the Holocaust to deal with that issue on the most fundamental theological level. And I think that there are elements within the Koran that likewise have to be looked at. Because like it or not, there are verses within the Koran that are being used to justify the most appalling crimes, and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Yes, no doubt. And I think at the beginning, I think I said I agreed with you. I think when it comes to the justifications, there’s no doubt that Islamic justifications are being offered, Koranic justifications are being offered. I think that that’s where we definitely agree. And I’m not one of those who says this has nothing to do with Islam. But I would end by saying this. In my view, Tom, it’s — the violent reading of the Koran is not what’s leading to political violence. It’s political violence that’s leading to a violent reading of the Koran. I think that’s where we disagree, is what comes first is where I think we disagree. But Tom Holland, we’ll have to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TH:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> Tom Holland is a British writer and historian, and author of the book “In the Shadow of the Sword.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> To end today’s show, we’re going to leave you some advice from the SIGINT Philosopher. The Philosopher was a columnist in the NSA’s internal newsletter called SIDtoday, or Signals Intelligence Directorate Today, which The Intercept received through documents leaked by Edward Snowden. In real life, the philosopher was a language analyst with the NSA. He’s essentially a failed novelist who became a spy, and well, this column was as close as he was ever going to get to fulfilling that dream. Today, the Philosopher tries to answer the ethical question of how one follows a policy set forth by their superiors with which they disagree. Spoiler: It involves Captain Jack Sparrow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill Camp:\u003c/strong> The SIGINT Philosopher. Lessons for civil servants from the American Civil War that don’t concern killing vampires.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m an enthusiast of the American Civil War. I’m not proud of this, as I long held that the Civil War was the lone preserve of aging, bearded, paunchy men named [redacted], who would make up for their lack of charisma by memorizing the entire order of battle for Longstreet’s wing at Chancellorsville, or reenacting Chickamauga on the weekends with paintball guns. But eventually, it got to me. It’s hard to resist the compelling nature of the crucible of our nation’s history, especially when I live within two hours of a dozen of the most important battles. I may have even been seen celebrating the 150\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> anniversary of Antietam in September at Sharpsburg. Not as a reenactor, although I do have an excellent beard.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As I’ve begun to read a little deeper into the war, I can’t help but think that if I had been an advisor to Lincoln at the outset of war in 1861, I’d have probably told him that trying to win such a war was insane. I think I’d have advised him that it was folly to try and fight a war to make a nation as large as the South agree to rejoin the union. Questions I’d have raised might have included: “How will you raise an army? Who will lead it when so many of the best officers are from the South? How will you raise taxes to support it when you have a population that hates taxes? What if Europe intercedes? And what if, by some miracle, we can win this war? How will we govern a people who do not want to be governed, and who may continue a low-level resistance forever?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My reasoning would have been based on a pragmatic philosophy that I have spent a lot of time developing, and which I can elucidate eloquently. Not as eloquently, though, as Jack Sparrow elucidates the same philosophy when he hits Will Turner upside the head and tells him, “The only thing in this world that matters is what I can do and what I can’t do.” For all my well-reasoned dissent, though, the advice I’d have given Lincoln would have been wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We are all experts, or at least very well informed, about the issues we work. And there is a good chance that, as an expert, you may find that you disagree with our national policy on the issue you work. If you are an expert in information security, maybe you think our cybersecurity posture is weak. If you’re an expert in Zendian foreign policy, maybe you think we’re talking too hawkish or too soft a stance on the Zendian arms embargo. We probably all have something we know a lot about that is being handled at a higher level in a manner we’re not entirely happy about. This can cause great cognitive dissonance for us, because we may feel our work is being used to help the government follow a policy we feel is bad. Such cognitive dissonance isn’t new. U.S. Grant, the great hero of the Civil War, first earned his bona fides in the Mexican-American War. He wasn’t entirely thrilled about his role in that war, though. He once called the conflict “the most unjust war a powerful nation ever inflicted upon a weaker one.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, how do we reconcile ourselves to being cogs in a machine we think is damaging our own best interests? Many people may answer this with two versions of, “It’s not my responsibility.” You can take the less noble of the two versions of this and simply say, “It’s above my pay grade. And as long as I’m getting paid, it’s on someone else if they mess up.” The higher form of this sentiment might say, “I may not like what decision-makers are doing, but my oath is to uphold the Constitution. And as long as those decision-makers are operating constitutionally, I will put my own feelings aside and support them.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Civil War has helped me to see two other ways I might reconcile my misgivings. First, I realized that as hard as it is to believe, I might actually be wrong. I’d have been wrong about the Civil War, although I’d have had brilliant reasons for being wrong. It is possible that, as much as I know about the subject I am an expert in, I still might have managed to just be wrong. Secondly, I realized that sometimes, you can be wrong and still get away with it if you commit to the wrong thing with enough determination. Legendary baseball pitcher Greg Maddux was once asked about how he became such a brilliant, foxy pitcher, always throwing the pitch that fooled the batters. He said he wasn’t really a genius, but that if you throw the pitch you mean to throw in the right location at the right speed, it doesn’t usually even matter if it’s the right pitch. You’ll still usually get a good result and end up looking like a genius.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No Civil War figure demonstrated this successful commitment to the wrong idea more than Confederate general Robert E. Lee. His campaigns are a study of foolhardiness that worked for the better part of two years. Time and again, he would buck all military wisdom, attack against greater forces, attack with his flank exposed, attack when Venus was aligned with Pluto. Attack, attack, attack. It worked for so long, in part because even though his plans may not have always been very wise, he and everyone in his command believed they would work and committed to making them work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I try to be a good lieutenant and good civil servant of even the policies I think are misguided. Perhaps I will be wrong; or perhaps, if I support a poor policy well enough, I can make that policy look like it was a good one all along. At the very least, I can always take solace that I have a really cool beard.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> That was actor Bill Camp as the SIGINT Philosopher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH:\u003c/strong> And that does it for this week’s show.

This week on Intercepted: Don Jr. is in the shit throne over a secret meeting he had with a Russian lawyer that was brokered by a D-list music agent. Could this be, as many in the media are claiming, the smoking gun of Russia collusion? Or are these people just really fucking dumb? Both? Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald weighs in. Rachel Maddow spent 20 minutes in primetime discussing a forged document sent to her MSNBC show. The forgery was created using a real document published by The Intercept. Glenn spoke to the alleged forger about why they did it and tells us what they said. (The fake document, which the forger said they sent to Maddow is below, if you want to play along from home). Jeremy gives an update on the latest Erik Prince/Trump administration shenanigans. And Intercept reporters Alice Speri and Alleen Brown talk about the shadowy mercenary company TigerSwan’s operations against water protectors protesting the Dakota Access pipeline.

And this is episode 22 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT Jr.:\u003c/strong> Well, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they’ll say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, the old adage that the cover-up is worse than the crime, it seems like it was specifically tailored for Donald Trump and his merry band of imbeciles, ideological zealots, and of course, family members. They’re like the political version of the Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight. Every time a new exposé drops from the New York Times or the Washington Post, what we really learn is how absolutely incompetent Trump and his inner circle are at keeping their lies secret. This week, it’s Donald Trump Jr.’s turn, as Washington is abuzz with discussions of this meeting that Don Jr. had during the presidential campaign with a lawyer who is Russian. And nowadays, being a Russian lawyer means you are a Kremlin connected lawyer, or a Russian government, or a Putin connected lawyer. And there are serious journalists who have spent a lot of time in Russia who cast serious doubts on how connected this particular lawyer actually is. But that’s for another discussion.\u003cbr />\nWhat is sort of relevant, I think, is that Jared Kushner was also at this meeting, and he appears not to have disclosed it on his SF 86 security form that is required to get national security clearance at the White House. And it gets dumber and it gets weirder. It turns out that this meeting that Don Jr. and Kushner were at, that it was set up by a music publicist named Rob Goldstone and he reps one Emin Agalarov. Agalarov is the son of Russian pop musician Aras Agalarov. And he’s a wealthy Russian who at one point was planning on building a Trump tower in Moscow. Donald, Sr., the president, knows them both well. In fact, he appeared in one of Emin’s music videos alongside a cast of Ms. Universe contestants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> Emin, wake up. Come on. What’s wrong with you? What’s wrong with you, Emin? Emin, let’s get with it. You’re always late. You’re just another pretty face. I’m really tired of you. You’re fired.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We’re gonna dig into this whole Don Jr. affair in a few minutes. But first, did any of you watch last Thursday’s Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC? Well, even if you didn’t, it’s important to note that it is now the number one rated prime time show on cable news in the United States. A lot of people actually watch it. And I bring that up because last Thursday, Rachel spent more than 20 minutes of her show discussing a story that we’re gonna get into in a second. In cable news hours, that’s like half of her show. And she spent it on what she billed as this ultra important exclusive that she claims she was reporting out, or discussing, as a public service for other news organizations covering the Trump/Russia story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rachel Maddow:\u003c/strong> Politically, this thing is so sensitive it takes all the air out of the room, and all of the nearby rooms as well. People talk about finding the smoking gun. What got sent to us was not just a smoking gun. It was a gun still firing proverbial bullets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Rachel Maddow explained to her viewers that someone very sophisticated had sent her an explosive document through her website. In this section that she sent up and often promotes, called “Send it to Rachel.” It’s sort of her version of the old dead drop site in the tech era. The document, Rachel said, was an ultra Top Secret NSA document. And the documents, she said, were so explosive that they could potentially change everything in an instant about what we understand about Trump and collusion with Russia. That is, if the document was real. Well, Rachel and her team at MSNBC, and this is what she said, spent weeks combing through this document. They had their intelligence analysts at MSNBC and their experts review it. They did forensic examinations of it. There was a big-time effort here. And after this thorough, CSI-like investigation, they determined that the document was a very, very sophisticated forgery.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RM:\u003c/strong> So, here’s the deal. We believe now that the real story we have stumbled upon here is that somebody out there is shopping carefully forged documents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But there’s more. Rachel Maddow and crew determined it was a forgery that was created using a document published by us, published by The Intercept on June 5. You’ll recall it was that NSA document that detailed purported Russian cyber-penetration activities by Moscow’s military intelligence targeting U.S. manufacturers of software used in U.S. elections. And on her show, Maddow played this game of, “I’m just asking questions or throwing ideas around” to imply that it was possible that whoever created this forged document and submitted it to “Send it to Rachel” may — may — have actually had access to it — drumroll, please. [Drumroll] Before The Intercept published it. [Dramatic sound effect]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, on the show, Maddow did not show this forged document, and she said that she wouldn’t reveal its contents, while at the same time saying, “If it had been true, it would have changed everything.” But she did explain how she and her team at MSNBC ultimately concluded, after weeks of analysis that it was built from The Intercept’s actual NSA document\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RM:\u003c/strong> Our document appears to be a cut and paste forgery derived from The Intercept’s document. We cannot know for sure. But if that is the case, then whoever did that work to create this forgery was cutting and pasting together a fake document, working from a document that was not yet publicly available.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, this week on Intercepted, we have our own exclusive of sorts. And it should serve as a warning to other news organizations to be vigilant not to fall for the same trick that the Rachael Maddow Show did. We actually spoke to the person who claimed to have forged the document that Rachel spent 20 minutes talking about. My colleague Glenn Greenwald actually was in touch with the person who claims they forged the document. And their story is — it’s pretty funny, the motivation for doing it. We’re also gonna be publishing this forged document on our episode page so you can play along at home and determine if you would have needed an army of intel analysts to determine if this document was real or fake. Well, joining me now is my colleague Glenn Greenwald. Glenn wrote an excellent story on this whole episode last week called “Rachel Maddow’s ‘Exclusive Scoop’” — in quotes — “About a Fake NSA Document Raises Several Key Questions.” Now, Glenn did get comment from Rachel for that story. He’s gonna talk about what she said in a second. As I said, for today’s, Rachel said she wouldn’t have a comment, and the reason, she said, is because she had learned her lesson from giving Glenn comment last week for his story. Glenn, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> First, before we get into sort of the exclusive that we have here, a funny little exclusive, talk about that segment and your analysis of it, and also what Rachel Maddow told you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> So, people have said, in response to this column, that she really only had one point, and that point was that media organizations have to be careful to authentic documents that they receive anonymously because they might be fraudulent. And if that were really her only point, one might wonder why she felt she had to spend 21 minutes at the top of her show with the word “exclusive” hovering behind her the whole time, as though media organizations didn’t know that it’s important to authenticate documents that they get in the mail from anonymous sources. Her actual point was much different and obvious. If we look at the reaction, which was that the document that she got, that she said was fraudulent, she said not only was based on The Intercept’s document that we published on June 5\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, the NSA Top Secret document, but that metadata on the document showed that the document she got was actually created before we published our document. In other words, that whoever sent her this forged document got access to it before we published it. Which led huge numbers of people on the internet to conclude either that the Trump White House or the NSA forged this document and sent it to Rachel to trick her, or that someone at The Intercept did that, or that someone had compromised our security.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the whole thing was based on this fundamental misunderstanding, or misreading, of metadata, which is that the date on the document in the metadata that she looked at was simply the date and time that we uploaded that document to the internet, that matched exactly the document that we published, proving that whoever send her that forged document took it from our site after we published it. Which means it could have been literally millions and millions of people, anyone in the public who saw that, significantly reducing the drama and importance of that story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What I found kind of amazing about that segment was that she went to great lengths to act like this super sleuth who was deciphering this riddle for her viewers, and how they figured out that this was actually a fabrication, and that The Intercept’s document was the underlying source that was used to create this fabricated document. And yet, when they go through all of the fabrications, they leave out the fact that they are now saying, “well, we’ve definitively figured out that this may actually have been created before The Intercept published it.” I mean, there’s a complete disconnect in logic from that segment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Well, because the whole point that she was trying to convey, which ended up being utterly and totally false, but was necessary for her to wildly inflate the importance of what she had, she tried to mislead people into believing that whoever sent her the forged copy had it not once we published it, but prior to our publication. Because what she was really trying to imply was that someone with high-level Top Secret access was trying to trick and discredit Rachel by sending her a forged document. And the only way that that would be true, the only way that’s interesting, is if she could say that whoever did this got access to this Top Secret document before we published it. Because if all it meant was that somebody saw it on our site and altered it with, like, some standard graphics or whatever, then it’s totally mundane. That happens all the time. Anyone from the Internet can take anything and alter it. It only is interesting if it was somebody with super Top Secret access. And she tried to imply that based on a complete and total misunderstanding or mis-assessment of what this metadata actually showed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and then on Twitter and elsewhere, you had the usual suspects who are always immediately accepting as true any criticisms or any allegations hurled at The Intercept. You have Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare, and of course, a close personal friend of Comey. He came out and said, “Aha! This proves that my theory about The Intercept having major security flaws in their protection of documents internally has been right.” Now again, he did apologize after you pressed him on it. But still, to this moment, you have members of the hashtag #theresistance believing and promoting the idea that it was The Intercept that actually sent this fabricated document in an effort to entrap Rachel Maddow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I mean, look. For years and years, Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity and Fox News made huge amounts of money and got massive ratings by feeding their readers wild, unhinged conspiracies about Obama, and before that, about Bill Clinton, that they were desperate to believe. And now Rachel Maddow has this huge ratings bonanza because every night she goes on the air and feeds people conspiracy theories that she knows they want to believe. And the key to it is that the people who watch her and the people in Washington, in New York, who are obsessed with the idea that Trump colluded with Russia or whatever, have zero critical faculties, or at least there’s zero willingness to use those critical faculties. Whatever they hear that’s pleasing to them, they instantly assume to be true, whether it comes from anonymous sources at the CIA or FBI, or unhinged cable hosts. And that’s exactly what happened here. It took the tiniest amount of critical thought to realize why what Rachel — this tale she was spinning, was bullshit, including the fact that even if we hadn’t had the proof that the metadata in her document matched the metadata in ours, just — it’s so easy to alter metadata. All — anyone could have just taken that document and changed the metadata to make it look like they had it before. But to believe that this extreme, wild, exotic conspiracy happened based on nothing is what we see over and over. And Rachel has benefited from that greatly, as has MSNBC, and she knows it. And so, there’s no reason for her to stop doing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, when you were writing your story that showed that this was all bullshit, and that it just took a little bit of actual sleuthing to figure out what was wrong with the narrative that Rachel Maddow was pushing, you actually got in touch with Rachel and had a back and forth with her. Talk about that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> You know, she and I had a back and forth, and I basically explained to her this issue with the metadata, and said, “Actually, the metadata proves that whoever sent you this forgery didn’t get it before we published, but actually got it from our site after we published.” And she got a little bit indignant and began insisting that this was totally consistent with everything she said, that she never meant to imply that the person who got this document got it before we published; that in fact, she said over, and over, that whoever sent it to her sent it after we published. Which was true, but the whole reason she spent so many minutes on this timeline was to imply that whoever got it obtained it pre-publication. And then once she saw the proof that that was false, instead of acknowledging that, instead of apologizing for not having contacted us before doing her story, which would have led her to find this out, she just got very defensive and started insisting that the meaning that so many people took from her report was not actually anything that she said. And so, it was not particularly constructive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It appears, Glenn, as though we have now a copy of this fabricated Top Secret NSA document that was sent to Rachel Maddow. And in a minute, I’m gonna read portions of it. But first, I want you to talk about how we got it and what the source told you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> So, someone contacted me anonymously on the day that I wrote the article, and said, “I’m the person who sent this document to Maddow.” He said, “I’m attaching a copy of what I sent to her.” He said, “I also sent it to other news organizations, and that my motive in doing it was that I wanted to test whether media outlets would just run with an obvious forgery if they liked the message.” And he said he literally — that Maddow made it seem like it was some sophisticated forgery, but that in fact, it took him about ten minutes to whip it up; that he did nothing but take the document from our site, stick it into a graphics program or a basic —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He used the Photoshop ‘photocopy’ filter on it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Right, right. He Photoshopped it and then made ‘photocopy’ to make it seem like it was a photocopy. He said he whipped it up in ten minutes, and that he purposely made it ridiculous to see if he could trick media outlets into running it. And the reason why I believe that he is in fact the person and that this is the document is because BuzzFeed said that they got the same document that Maddow got and instantly realized what a fucking joke it was. Like, BuzzFeed looked at it, and they’re like, this is an obvious fraud, and they just moved on. And there was one small difference in the document that BuzzFeed got and that Maddow got. And this person knew what the difference was in the two documents, which he could have only have known if he were the one who sent it, because BuzzFeed hadn’t publicly disclosed it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I read this fabricated document and, like, guffawed, because it is so transparently fake just on the way — on the content of it. But the title of the document is “Russia/Trump Campaign Communications: Trump Campaign Director David Bossie, Communications With Russian State Agents, Coordinating Release Of The WikiLeaks John Podesta Email Dump. September 2016 to October 2016.” And then the summary, it says, “Russian agents made contact with Trump campaign manager David Bossie on,” and then there’s a redacted, “by telephone at” redacted. “Security footage confirms the unregistered phone was purchased on,” and it says the word “redacted.” It’s not actually redacted, “by a member of David Bossie’s staff at redacted contact in September 2016. Mr. Bossie discussed the release of the ‘Podesta Files’ through the Russian front Wiki Leaks.” And WikiLeaks has a space between Wiki and Leaks, “with Russian State Agents.” And this is my favorite part of it. “In October 2016, it is believed Russian State Agents reestablished contact with Mr. Bossie, informing him of a potentially damaging video of Candidate Trump being released in the coming weeks.” It’s kind of astonishing that the number one cable news show in prime time actually promoted the idea that they believed at first that this document was, A) real, and B) that they would spend 20 minutes on their program talking about something that some dude made and sent in to them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Oh, my God. She — they spent weeks gathering experts and former NSA officials and lawyers to investigate this. She said that this was a very sophisticated forgery. Because again, she was trying to imply, because her story only matters that this came from the highest levels of the government. And so, to do that, she had to pretend that this was like some mastermind forgery that the likes of which could never have been perpetrated absent some very high-level skills, as opposed to the reality, which is that you read this document and you laugh your ass off the second you look at it because it’s the biggest, most obvious joke ever, as BuzzFeed and every other media outlet that got this document immediately concluded and said nothing about because it was such a crank and such a joke. I think that the reason why this is significant, aside from the fact that she is the most watched cable news host in the country, and one of the leading voices — media voices of the self-identified resistance, is because it’s just generally indicative of this broader trend of the media completely losing its mind when it comes to Russia.\u003cbr />\nAnd the best report that I’d recommend is a long article in The New Yorker by its Russia correspondent, who interviewed real Russian journalists, people who have reported intrepidly and courageously on Putin. Investigative journalists who have said that the American media has lost its mind when it comes to Russia, and it’s just like madness and hysteria, the way they think about Putin and their country. And it’s really worth reading.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, as I watch the massive protests against the G20 summit, and the protests against Trump and against Putin and against all these world leaders, and knowing that at the heart of that, they’re protests against neoliberal economic policies around the world, and you have countries throughout Europe that have been decimated by these economic neoliberal policies. Austerity measures have been imposed. At the same time, we have — the war in Syria is not abating. It’s getting worse. In Iraq, you have the third or fourth iteration of the post-9/11 wars in Iraq. The U.S. is surging in Afghanistan. And it’s sort of like, you know, if you can spend 20 minutes on the number one rated cable news show in the country right now talking about a document that some dude made in a few minutes, but not talk at all about what’s at the heart of the protests against the G20 summit, about the slaughter that’s happening around the world, not to mention what the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Britain are doing in Yemen, it says a lot about our priorities.\u003cbr />\nAnd it’s — it really is kind of an epic global wag the dog, where everyone is following the minutiae of, you know, the palace intrigue, and, you know, Trump is actually president. And the G20 leaders came together and agreed on most of everything. And it’s sort of like, you know, we’re gonna talk about Donald Trump Jr. because this is stuff that could eventually lead to, you know, serious problems for the Trump presidency. But I mean, do you get my point? Like, we’re not talking about the real issues that are important to people around the world and the issues that are actually causing people to lose their lives and lose their livelihoods.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> And this has been the problem for the Democrats for over a year now. And a lot of Democrats — you know, Democratic officials are starting to explicitly recognize it, which is, they ran an entire campaign based on issues that many, many people, arguably most people, didn’t really care about. People don’t care when they wake up in the morning — they’re not worried about what Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin are doing. They really didn’t care about these character issues that the Clinton campaign based its entire campaign on. They care about what can the Democratic Party do to improve my life? So, you have this entire Democratic Party and their media allies obsessed with Russia, which isn’t to say it isn’t a story — it isn’t to say that it doesn’t merit investigation. We’ve all said from the start that it does, and it is being investigated formally now, by a well-trusted, longtime prosecutor, Robert Mueller, and his team of prosecutors. So, the truth is all gonna come out eventually, as it should.\u003cbr />\nBut in the meantime, everything else is getting crowded out — questions about the implications of Donald Trump’s foreign policy, his domestic policy, the effect that it’s having on people. Very little of it gets discussed, in part because the Democrats have gambled that this Russia collusion issue is gonna be the silver bullet that brings down Trump. And at least thus far, it doesn’t look like that that’s gonna happen. And in the meantime, there are millions and millions of people out in the United States who are suffering, waking up with anxiety about job prospects, and healthcare, and their kids, hearing virtually nothing from the Democratic Party, again, still, about what they intend to do to improve their lives. And I think that’s a serious danger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to say, before we get into the meat of what The New York Times reported, that it’s remarkable how the story just keeps changing with this White House. I mean, how many times has Mike Pence either knowingly lied on national television or in speeches, or has he been lied to, and then he’s going out and is sort of sent to the dogs to pass the lies on. But the list of lies that just the Vice President has told over the past six months, including before he was vice president, is in and of itself astonishing. The way that the Trump White House has handled these allegations by just kind of tweeting rage or tweeting blatantly idiotic things, in and of itself, is something I guess worth talking about. But the reason I wanted to talk about this Donald Trump Jr. thing is because they really have lied a lot about this stuff, Glenn. And that is disturbing when you’re talking about the First Family, and you’re talking about the highest rungs of official established power in the United States — your read on this story?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> So, a few things. First of all, obviously, it’s a serious problem when high government officials — which by the way, does not include Donald Trump Jr., though he was a campaign official — but others like Jared Kushner, and Trump himself, and Pence, have repeatedly lied to the public. Yes, it is a bad thing when government officials lie. Unfortunately, we’ve created a moral standard where we don’t actually punish them even politically, let alone legally, for doing so. I think the way that you can look at this Donald Trump Jr. story is very similar to a lot of the other Russia stories, which is — the ultimate question is: Is there underlying evidence of actual criminal collusion? So, if what happened is what Donald Trump Jr. says is what happened — and that’s a big if, but that’s so far the only version that we have, which is, someone told him, “Hey, there’s this woman. She’s a Russian lawyer, and she says she has incriminating evidence on your father’s campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton.” And he said, “Okay, I’m willing to listen to what she had — has to say.” He went, realized she didn’t have much, and then left. That doesn’t seem criminal to me. It doesn’t even seem uncommon to me. I mean, I keep reading all these things online about how it’s treasonous to be willing to get dirt on your opponents from Russians. And yet, the entire Steele memo, which Democrats love and have continually cited, is nothing but that. All that is — is an operative paid by the Democratic Party, by the Clinton campaign, going to Russia and getting dirt about Donald Trump from Russians. That’s what campaigns do. Anyone who tells a campaign operative, “I have dirt on your opponent” is gonna be listened to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, as far as the inconsistent statements are concerned, like Donald Trump Jr. first denying it and then kind of poo-pooing it, and now coming out with more details once The New York Times catches him — I think you can look at that in one of two ways. Either the reason why Trump officials keep lying about and getting caught in inconsistencies concerning their meetings with Russians is because there really is underlying criminality, and at some point, we’ll see the evidence of that, and they’re lying about it because they want to cover that criminality up. Or, the alternative explanation is that in Washington, the climate now is that if you meet with anyone who’s Russian, even if they’re not a Russian official, as this lawyer isn’t — she’s “Kremlin-connected,” whatever that means. To me, that means she’s Russian. We’ve created this climate where any meeting with Russians of any kind is deemed nefarious and even treasonous. And so, in that climate, it makes sense to me that people like Jeff Sessions, or Michael Flynn, or Donald Trump Jr., or Jared Kushner, would want to downplay how many times they met with Russians and how deep these meetings were because they know that any meetings that they have are gonna be depicted in this nefarious light.\u003cbr />\nWhether — it’s one or the other. Whether it’s actually covering up underlying criminal behavior or it’s just a political fear of trying to downplay these meetings because of how it gets depicted is something we’re gonna find out. We’re gonna have a comprehensive report by a well-regarded prosecutor armed with subpoena powers who will finally tell us whether there’s real criminality here. And that’s why it’s just so irritating that we’re obsessed with everyday leaks as though — you know, these are like stories that dominate the news cycle for 12 hours. People get excited that it’s gonna be the final nail in the coffin of the Trump presidency. And then it disappears because there’s no underlying evidence of criminality. And I just think that until we have that, this story will be lacking.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What if kind of the darkest narrative is true here, that this woman was Kremlin-connected, this lawyer, that she came, and that she — let’s say she did have information, and she presented to them, that did show something questionable about Secretary Clinton when she was running for president. Would you have any problem then, given the whole history of how opposition research is used in American politics? Is there anything inherently wrong with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner receiving information that they can effectively use as opposition research from someone who is actually connected to the Kremlin, if that’s true?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> No. No, I do not. And for people who are shocked or outraged by that answer, I guess the way — the question I would pose is, look at the Steele memo. That’s what the Steele memo is. It’s the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign hiring\u003cstrong>*\u003c/strong> a former member of British intelligence to go to Russia and get dirt about Donald Trump from the Russians. I guarantee you a lot of the Russians he spoke with were “Kremlin-connected.” That’s how they have the dirt in the first place. Nobody said it was immoral for the DNC or for the Clinton campaign to try and get dirt on Donald Trump that comes from the inner circles of the Kremlin or from Russian intelligence because that’s what campaigns do. Why is it okay for the investigators of the Steele memo to get dirt about Donald Trump from Russians, but it’s not okay for Donald Trump Jr. to get dirt about Hillary Clinton from Russians? I really would love somebody to explain that — the discrepancy in that standard for me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>*Clarification:\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cem>It has not been established that Hillary Clinton’s campaign or the official Democratic Party directly paid for the production of the so-called Steele dossier. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-intelligence-report-explainer.html?_r=0\">It has been reported\u003c/a> that “allies” of Clinton contributed to its funding.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn Greenwald, great to have you back on the show. Thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Always happy to be back, Jeremy. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn Greenwald is my fellow co-founder of The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JG:\u003c/strong> Before we go to break, I have two brief updates that I want to give our listeners. The first is, as you know, we’ve done a lot of reporting and discussion on this show about Erik Prince of Blackwater infamy and his ties to the Trump White House, and particularly, his close relationship with Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News. And even before Trump officially became president, I was reporting at The Intercept and on this show after Trump became president on the connections of Erik Prince to Vice President Mike Pence, as well as Bannon. And a few weeks ago on the show, we talked about Prince pitching his idea for a mercenary force to take over the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Well, on Monday of this week, The New York Times ran an article. They reported that Bannon and Jared Kushner actually brought in Erik Prince and a guy named Stephen Feinberg, who is the billionaire owner of the mercenary company DynCorp. And according to The Times, these two mercenary kingpins were brought in to “devise alternatives to the Pentagon’s plan to send thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan.” The paper says that insiders have referred to this proposal as the “Laos option,” which apparently is a reference to the CIA’s dirty war, dirty campaign, in Laos in the 1970s. Erik Prince himself, as we’ve reported on this show, has called for a new version of the Phoenix program, which was the CIA’s assassination program in Vietnam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in an appearance on Steve Bannon’s radio show before Trump was elected, Prince said that such a Phoenix style program should be used to defeat terror networks around the world. According to the New York Times, Defense Secretary James Mattis listened politely to Steve Bannon when Bannon tried to convince him to adopt this mercenary position, but he declined to implement it. We’re gonna keep you updated on all of those developments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then the second update I have relates to this story that we did in early June that I was mentioning in the earlier segment about Rachel Maddow, having to do with the Russian cyber-espionage efforts targeting U.S. software companies that service elections in the United States in some states. And of course, someone was arrested — an NSA contractor named Reality Winner was arrested, and the FBI put out this heavily politicized affidavit really kind of trying to convict her before she even goes to trial.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, this week, First Look Media, which is The Intercept’s parent company, announced that it’s going to be contributing financially to the defense of this alleged whistleblower Reality Winner. She’s facing prosecution under the Espionage Act on charges that she was the one who anonymously leaked this Top Secret NSA document to The Intercept. And of course, The Intercept does not know who sent that document to us, who the person was. But we are against any attempts to prosecute whistleblowers under the Espionage Act, in part because it’s an attack on the very existence of a free press. And this is really outrageous, that Reality Winner is being held without bail while she’s awaiting trial. And in addition to helping directly fund her defense, First Look is also providing $50,000.00 in matching funds through its Press Freedom Defense Fund to a group called Stand With Reality. That’s a grassroots crowd-funding effort that is seeking to support public awareness and legal work around winner’s case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I actually want to briefly draw your attention to a statement this week by our editor-in-chief, Betsy Reed, about the internal review that we said we were gonna be conducting about this story, the NSA Russia hacking story. And in her statement, Betsy writes:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Betsy Reed:\u003c/strong> An internal review of the reporting of this story has now been completed. The ongoing criminal case prevents us from going into detail, but I can state that at several points in the editorial process, our practices fell short of the standards to which we hold ourselves for minimizing the risks of source exposure when handling anonymously provided materials. Like other journalistic outlets, we routinely verify such materials with any individuals or institutions implicated by them, and we seek their comment. This process carries some risks of source exposure that are impossible to mitigate when dealing with sensitive materials. Nonetheless, it is clear that we should have taken greater precautions to protect the identity of a source who was anonymous even to us. As the editor-in-chief, I take responsibility for this failure, and for making sure that the internal newsroom issues that contributed to it are resolved. We are conducting a comprehensive analysis of our source protection protocols, and will make revisions to ensure that any materials provide to us, anonymously, are handled in the most secure manner possible. It remains core to our mission to ensure that all our journalism is carried out in a manner that honors the risks that whistleblowers take.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That statement in its entirety is available at theintercept.com.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And you are listening to Intercepted. When we come back, we’re gonna talk about the shadowy mercenary company TigerSwan. They were the ones hired to target activists protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. And we’re also going to speak to Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, we are back here at Intercepted. And in late May, the Intercept published part one of an ongoing investigative series about a U.S. mercenary firm hired to infiltrate and gather intelligence on water protectors and their allies protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. The series that The Intercept published is based on more than a hundred leaked internal documents from this firm TigerSwan. And these documents show how TigerSwan surveilled pipeline opponents from the air, on social media, through radio eavesdropping, and also through the actual infiltration of the camps and activist circles. And then they shared that intel with local law enforcement. These documents were leaked to The Intercept by a contractor working for TigerSwan. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline, they were the ones that hired TigerSwan. And the fact that this mercenary company is now operating inside the U.S. — and they were not just in the Dakotas. They have their sights set on several other U.S. states as well — that’s an ominous development in an already heavily paramilitarized law enforcement landscape in this country. You can read all five of the articles in this series at theintercept.com. A sixth installment is gonna be published in the coming days. The reporters who have been doing this story are Alleen Brown, Will Parrish, and Alice Speri. Two of them join me now. Alleen Brown, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alleen Brown:\u003c/strong> Thanks so much, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alice Speri, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alice Speri:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, when I see TigerSwan, I think of former special operations soldiers. I think of the work that TigerSwan did. And I’ve spent a little bit of time over my work as a journalist looking at TigerSwan. They’ve been involved with covert contracts with the U.S. military and with U.S. intelligence agencies in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. To see that they’re then deployed on indigenous soil inside the United States, or inside of the borders of the United States, I think for a lot of people is and, it should be, shocking and kind of an affront to people’s understanding of the Constitution of the United States. It’s sort of a work around of posse comitatus, which prohibits the U.S. military from operating on U.S. soil in a law enforcement capacity. But if you have former U.S. military doing it, it’s kind of a backdoor way of having soldiers face down against water protectors, which is the term that the movement uses. The media often calls them protestors. They call themselves water protectors. There’s a lot to cover here. But I wanted to just begin with you giving an overview of the documents that we’ve published at The Intercept that you’ve reported out, what they say, and who the main players are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> TigerSwan is a private security contractor that worked on the Dakota Access pipeline. A contractor for TigerSwan leaked more than 100 internal documents describing their daily activities monitoring the pipeline and surveilling water protectors protesting its construction. So, there’s a few things that the documents tell us. I mean, for one, they show us the invasive tactics that this private security firm was using: use of aerial surveillance, as well as a propaganda campaign. The documents, in their descriptions of the activities of the water protectors, use really militaristic language, comparing water protectors to Jihadist fighters at times. At one point, they describe the movement as an “ideologically driven insurgency with a strong religious component.” And another thing about the leaked documents is that they reveal this private security firm’s collaboration with law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who hired TigerSwan, Alice?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> So, in this case, TigerSwan was hired by Energy Transfer partners, which is the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. But I think what you’re pointing out, too, is really interesting. This is a company that’s, for the most part, done foreign contracts for the Department of Defense. They have worked in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they’ve taken those same tactics back to the U.S. I think that’s very clear in the language they use when describing water protectors. They talk about them as Jihadists. They talk about their direct actions as attacks. They talk about the camps as a battlefield. It’s really quite fascinating to see the language of war sort of brought back home. You know, if they have been able to operate in such an unchecked manner here in the United States, where we have reported, for instance, that they worked in North Dakota without a license for months. They just recently got sued because of that, but they were still able to be on the ground there basically since September with pretty much free reign. Who knows what they’re doing in Iraq and Afghanistan, where there’s even less scrutiny of their actions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And Alleen, the main guy at TigerSwan is this former colonel, James Reese. Describe who James Reese is, as much as you’ve been able to gather about his history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> Sure. James Reese is a former commander for Delta Force. And many of the contractors he’s employed to work for TigerSwan are also former Special Ops members, so many from Delta Force. Beyond his background in the military, TigerSwan is being sued, as Alice mentioned, by the North Dakota Private Investigations and Security Board, which provides licenses to private security firms in North Dakota. And they’re being sued because they were denied a license to operate as a security firm after doing so for several months.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I remember back in 2005, in New Orleans, in the aftermath of the flooding of the city, I encountered Blackwater mercenaries on the streets of New Orleans saying that they were there to, you know, stop looters and confront criminals. And they too had operated for a period without a license to be a private security firm inside of the state of Louisiana. Eventually, they claimed that they were deputized by the governor of the state of Louisiana. And ultimately, we learned that they had actually  been hired on a contract with the Department of Homeland Security. In this case, though, we’re talking about a private company hiring its own private mercenary force, and they’re using the same language that they use when they’re hired by the U.S. government to work on so-called counterterrorism operations. Find, fix, and finish is a term that we reported on in the Drone Papers, which is used for finding a target, fixing their location, and then finishing them off, either in a night raid or in a drone strike. TigerSwan used this phrase in the documents to talk about the targeting of water protectors — “find, fix and eliminate.” What kinds of tactics were TigerSwan’s operatives using against the water protectors?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Basically, some of the things that we learned about in their situation reports are aerial surveillance; very, very intense social media monitoring; and then direct infiltration, which I think is one of the most fascinating and disturbing aspects of it. We know that they had undercover agents in the camps for long periods of time, building relationships with water protectors, and then using those relationships to feed information back to their clients. They were also creating lists of people of interest. They were collecting photos and personal information. They were collecting license plates numbers and all kinds of like, really detailed — really detailed information on people that they still have. And the other thing that I think is really important to stress, that we’ve been reporting on, is that, yes, Energy Transfer partners was the client, and so this was really a private contract that TigerSwan had. But at the same time, without that relationship being sanctioned in any contract, they were also feeding all of this information to law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, for instance, we were able to find some of their reports that were leaked to us, eventually made it into the public record as well, because they were sent by TigerSwan to local police. The local police was using this to inform their actions on the grounds. Their reports also talk about TigerSwan, you know, regularly meeting with local sheriffs, with state and sometimes federal agents to discuss some of their findings. So, I think it’s important that we remember that, yes, they were not directly deputized by law enforcement, but they worked with them very closely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In the first story that you did in the series, you cite an October 3\u003csup>rd\u003c/sup> report where TigerSwan — this is a direct quote from one of the documents — “exploitation of ongoing native versus non-native rifts and tribal rifts between peaceful and violent elements is critical in our efforts to delegitimize the anti-DAPL movement. Talk about that, Alleen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> The documents frequently note rifts within the movement, and at times, as you mentioned, talk about the imperative of exploiting them. So, this is kind of where we see the work of TigerSwan shifting outside of just surveilling the movement into also influencing it. So, another example that kind of speaks to that is this counterinformation campaign that TigerSwan was pushing forward. You know, they frequently analyze the news coverage that the pipeline is getting in reference to the need to combat it. We learned that one of those efforts transformed into the production of videos published on Facebook featuring an individual posing as an anchor, a news anchor, critiquing the water protector movement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Robert Rice of TigerSwan:\u003c/strong> Now, let us be clear. We are not against peaceful protesting. However, many of the members of this cell have been part of the destruction in Standing Rock last year. And they’ve all been posting regularly on social media about how they refuse to be part of society. That means constantly asking for money and support for locals. We are not here to convince you they shouldn’t be welcomed into your community. We just want to make you aware of the full situation to keep you informed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> So, this individual did not disclose that he was working for TigerSwan. Essentially, this is a form of fake news that people were sharing and liking on Facebook that they had no idea was being produced by this private security firm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The fact is that TigerSwan then was not only focused on the Dakota Access pipeline. They also set their sights on another project that clearly, they though that what they had done in Dakota was this great success. And then they started looking at Mariner East 2. Talk about what that is and what the private security industry was hoping to gain by working on that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. So, first of all, something that’s important to notice is that TigerSwan is obviously a for profit company. And it’s very clear in all of the reports that they’re constantly trying to justify their presence. So, they’re constantly describing the situation on the ground as being more dangerous and more volatile than it actually was in an effort to continue their contracts, to gain more contracts in other states.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As you guys point out in the pieces, you wrote something like, it borders on parody, the way that they’re using military terms to describe the caliber of munitions for — you know, for paint guns and the stockpiling of protest signs. I mean, it really —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Absolutely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, it does read as though a desperate attempt to justify their presence. You know, another one, “operational weakness allows TS, TigerSwan, elements to further develop and dictate the battle space.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> I mean, if they weren’t so disturbing, these reports would actually be pretty hilarious. Like they’re an interesting read, definitely. The language and the images they convey are certainly characteristic of a certain type of company and framework, really. But yes, that’s definitely what they’re doing. They’re trying to make it look as if things are about to blow up any second. They’re like obsessing over the potential for crimes, the potential for weapons. They’re always very vague in their speculations, but they’re very alarmist. And that’s part of their effort to convince their client, and other clients, possibly, that there is this massive need for security, and this massive need for surveillance and infiltration. So, as you mentioned, they are already beginning to look past the Dakota Access pipeline to other pipeline projects. And, you know, the protests are actually dying down in North Dakota. A lot of the camps were evacuated and people started leaving. And so, TigerSwan finds itself in the position of needing to justify its paycheck, essentially. And so, they start talking about other pipelines. They also talk about Mariner East 2 Pipeline in Pennsylvania, where they do have a presence, as we reported in one of our stories. But they also began talking about the Bayou Bridge Pipeline in Louisiana, the Rover Pipeline in Ohio. They’re starting to sort of build the ground for possible future work. I would also like to point out that after our reporting and after the lawsuit in North Dakota, ETP actually dropped TigerSwan in North Dakota. They’re still working with them in other states, but they’re no longer working in North Dakota. And I imagine that they will consider new contracts with some more scrutiny going forward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What does the future hold for TigerSwan as you can best assess from reporting on this story?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Well, we know right now they are in some legal trouble, at least in North Dakota, right? They are getting sued for operating without a license. And I think that was partially a result of our investigation, really. We saw this lawsuit that used some of our documents as exhibits. I think, you know, these are very creative companies. We’ve seen — you’ve mentioned Blackwater before. These are companies that have a history of sort of resurrecting themselves and finding new ways to stay in business. I think one thing that TigerSwan is positioning itself or it’s really monitoring that goes much beyond pipeline protests and environmental activism — some of the infiltration they did in Chicago, for instance, into a very wide-ranging set of activist groups. They look at the anti-Trump resistance, which of course is a very broad movement, so to speak. They look at some Black Lives Matter activists. There’s all kinds of potential there for TigerSwan and others like it to stay in business. And that’s actually something else we want to remember, is TigerSwan is one of several private security companies that were involved in the policing of the DAPL protest. So, if their legal troubles eventually kill them off, there will be many others to pick up the work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> I mean, I would say just the level of freedom that a private company like this has to surveil a social movement should be really shocking. You know, we’ve done a lot of reporting at The Intercept about the deep limitations to the guidelines that entities like the FBI have to follow in order to carry out covert operations. You know, we’ve reported that their guidelines are essentially insufficient. But a private security firm like TigerSwan doesn’t have to follow anything like that. There are so few rules about what they have to do and the constitutional protections that they have to keep in mind that it raises a lot of important questions about the tactics that private companies, profit-seeking companies, can use to enhance their bottom line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and it’s — you know, I think people would do well to read the history of the Pinkertons in this country, and also look at the utter lack of accountability for all of the crimes committed by contractors abroad in Iraq, Afghanistan, and, you know, whatever new battlefields are going to emerge in the Trump era. Well, I want to highly recommend that people read this incredible series that Alleen and Alice have reported. It’s of vital importance that we focus on real issues and not just be following the tit for tat of the Democrats and the Trump administration, because for many people, these are life and death issues, and it certainly is a life and death issue for the planet. So, I want to thank both of you, Alice Speri and Alleen Brown, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Thank you, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AB:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alleen Brown and Alice Speri are both journalists at The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And finally, we’re gonna end today’s show with some music. When it comes to the intersection of politics, activism, and music, very few bands actually walk the walk. The band Downtown Boys, they’re one of them, and they do it gracefully, with a hell of a lot of energy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Wave of History,” Downtown Boys]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Coming in on a wave\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A wave of history\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Coming in on a wave\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A wave of history\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Once called America’s most exciting punk band by Rolling Stone, and recently quoted as Tom Morello’s favorite punk band, the Providence, Rhode Island, quartet is upfront about who they are: Latinx, queer, bilingual. And their actions, such as successfully leading the charge in forcing the festival South by Southwest to change its artist contracts, which you’ll recall threatened musicians with deportation, show where Downtown Boys stand: for the marginalized and oppressed, and against white hegemony, American imperialism, and the police state. Well, our producer Jack D’Isidoro spoke to lead singer Victoria Ruiz about what it means to be a musician living in the Trump era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Downtown Boys]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Victoria Ruiz:\u003c/strong> My name is Victoria Ruiz, and I’m the vocalist in Downtown Boys. Our music is filled with messages of our own personal experiences of having to deal with colonialism by white supremacy, by toxic masculinity, and by systems and institutions that weren’t made for our survival. And I think that, like, our music is very much about figuring out how to live so that we can survive, so that we can exist, and think about how to dismantle a lot of why we’re here. And we had a lot of messages around workers. We had a lot of messages around policing. And I think that it was like this very broad sort of swoop about capital. And I think we’re coming out with a new album called “Cost of Living.” And I think it’s getting at sort of the mundanities and the nuances of actually having to think about the distribution of resources and what that cost is of that void, of that space between you and freedom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I grew up in the Bay Area. I grew up in San Jose. And I grew up in a Chicana-dominated family, so I didn’t grow up with a dad. I had like all the women in the family were the breadwinners, the caretakers, and like, the leaders of the family. And I think that that affected me in a really good way, and that I feel like I was in this seashell where I got to develop and grow. And then I think when I left the shell behind, I’m very vulnerable to the fact that that’s not how the rest of the world really functions. And I think that’s honestly been my entry point. Like I remember just kind of being in school or — and having to deal with seeing the way that boys were being fed a lot of, like, masculine propaganda and being bullied, and like, having my grandma come during lunchtime and like, yell at the bullies. Like, I feel like that’s a very — what punk wishes it could be, is, you know, really awesome Mexican-American grandmas yelling at the bullies sometimes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Somos Chulas (No Somos Pendejas)”, Downtown Boys]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VR:\u003c/strong> So, “Somos Chulas (No Somos Pendejas)” is my favorite song on the record. And it translates into like, “We’re precious, and elegant, and intelligent, and we’re not stupid.” And I think a lot of us who are trying to use culture as a weapon deal with a lot of pushback because capitalism doesn’t want that. And that’s what this song is really about. It’s all in Spanish mostly, but it riffs on Nina Simone’s song “I Ain’t Got No,” where she’s like, “Ain’t got no money, ain’t got no shoes, ain’t got no sweater.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Ain&#8217;t Got No, I Got Life,” Nina Simone]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ain’t got no home\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no shoes\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no money\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no class\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ain’t got no skirts\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no sweaters\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no perfume\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no love\u003cbr />\nAin’t got no faith\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VR:\u003c/strong> And she talks about all the things she doesn’t have, and then she’s like, “But I got my body, I got my smile, I got my love.” And she talks about all the things she does have.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Ain&#8217;t Got No, I Got Life,” Nina Simone]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I got my hair, got my head,\u003cbr />\nI got my brains, got my ears,\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Got my eyes, got my nose,\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Got my mouth, I got my sex\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I got my arms, got my hands —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>VR:\u003c/strong> And so, “Somos Chulas” does the same thing.

Hint: all around you, Mr. President. This week on Intercepted: Falling, falling is Babylon the Great! Just the greatest. The best. Tremendous. The famed rebel academic, Alfred McCoy, whose book on narcotrafficking the CIA tried to stop from being published, lays out his meticulously argued theory that the U.S. empire will fall by the year 2030. The Washington Post’s media columnist, Margaret Sullivan, explains why she is not yet convinced that Trump colluded with Russia and talks about Trump ratcheting up the war on whistleblowers and the existence of a free press. Jeremy weighs in on the mounting civilian death toll from U.S.-led strikes in Iraq and Syria. Under Trump, that toll has skyrocketed to 360 civilians killed per month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jonathan Karl:\u003c/strong> Health and Human Services, Secretary Dr. Tom Price.

Allow the collapse of the health care program in which tens of millions of American men, women, and children &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill:\u003c/strong> This is Intercepted. I&#8217;m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from The Intercept, and this is episode 23 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Donald Trump squeezed himself into a fire truck this week to celebrate American-made products, or something. And like a little kid who the tough firefighters let sit in their fire truck, Trump wanted to know where the fire was — that he would almost certainly not help put out. As president, Trump has started his share of fires already and he&#8217;s doused gasoline on fires other people started.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Remember when Trump and his advisors promised that they would kill the families of suspected terrorists?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mehdi Hasan: \u003c/strong>Would you kill the family of a terror suspect? Yes or no?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>General Michael Flynn:\u003c/strong> Waterboarding was legal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH: \u003c/strong>OK. Would you kill the family of a terror suspect? Yes or no?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MF: \u003c/strong>I would, I would have to see what the circumstances of that situation was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MH: \u003c/strong>Are you kidding me?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump: \u003c/strong>You have to take out their families. When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>They spoke about killing and war like a real estate deal. Or a game show. Sort of like kids getting to sit on an awesome tank. And just six months into office, Trump is presiding over a bloodbath that is killing civilians in record numbers in Iraq in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The independent war monitoring group, Airwars, published a new investigation last week showing that under Trump, U.S. led strikes have killed almost as many civilians in a half a year as they did it Obama&#8217;s last year or so in office. Airwars estimates that more than 2,200 civilians have been killed in U.S. and coalition strikes since Trump became president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To put it a different way, under Obama the U.S. killed about 80 civilians a month in Iraq and Syria. Under Trump, that number is closer to 360 civilians killed a month. Now why is this the case? It&#8217;s not entirely clear at this moment, but as we said on the show before there have been reports that Trump has relaxed the rules of engagement for the military allowing operations to go ahead even if it&#8217;s known that civilians are going to be killed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I also want to say another development to watch is that the U.S. is increasingly deploying U.S. troops boots on the ground on clandestine or covert missions inside of both Somalia and Yemen. Look for that to flare up sometime in the near future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, despite reports that the military and the deep state are somehow protecting the Republic from Donald Trump, it seems to me that some of the most hawkish elements of the intelligence and military community — they&#8217;re doing just fine under Trump&#8217;s non-watchful, non-vigilant turn at the helm of power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: Among the chief beneficiaries of this administration are some of the most dangerous and unsavory forces within the U.S. military and national security apparatus. Follow the money and the bombs. They almost always lead back to those pulling the strings behind the scenes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, speaking of behind the scenes, there are so many questions that continue to swirl around that meeting that Don. Jr and Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort and who knows who else, had with the lawyer from Russia. Well the Trump Administration keeps changing its story and in changing its story, it&#8217;s proving for anyone with a brain that they have lied over and over and over as details about this story trickled out. It&#8217;s really astonishing to watch.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Meanwhile, Trump and the congressional Republican leadership&#8217;s much hyped effort to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something that would result in a horrendous dystopia for millions of Americans appears to be totally dead now. Trump&#8217;s approval rating is in the toilet, he made a fool of himself in Paris and the most powerful media outlets in the country continue to have their knives out for Trump. And Trump seems happy to put himself on their cutting boards, day after day after day. Trump and his loyalists seem to be banking on the idea that if they just repeat, &#8220;Fake news, fake news, fake news&#8221; over and over and they tweet their alternative reality, that they&#8217;re going to be able to weather these storms.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ll say one thing about this: Trump is lucky that the Democratic Party is so incompetent at taking him on and energizing people. If the Democrats had their act together, if they had real vision, we might actually see a swift conclusion to this presidency. But at this point? That seems some ways away, if it will happen at all, before the natural course of the Trump presidency is played out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I also want to caution people to remember that facts matter and they matter in the case of Trump as well. Just because we want to believe something, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s true. We should go wherever the facts lead us. But it does no one any good to engage in massive evidence-free leaps about the extent of Russian involvement with Trump. Let&#8217;s uncover the facts confront their implications and meaning as we have them. That is responsible journalism. It&#8217;s not that Trump deserves any grand benefit of the doubt. As president, he doesn&#8217;t deserve the benefit of the doubt. He deserves to be investigated. Mistrust and then verify. But it&#8217;s that we as journalists have an obligation to assert what we can prove.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Joining me now is Margaret Sullivan. She&#8217;s the media columnist for The Washington Post and, until recently, she was the public editor of The New York Times. Margaret, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Margaret Sullivan:\u003c/strong> Hi.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The first thing I want to ask you about, I mean, I should say I have tremendous respect for you. In fact, I would say you&#8217;re one of the people that I respect most that operates in, for lack of a better term, big media. And I particularly loved your work when you were the public editor at The New York Times. And having said that, you understand the motivation for my question. Are you convinced by the reporting that we&#8217;ve seen that there was collusion between President Trump and his campaign or members of his White House and the Russian government?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> No at I&#8217;m not convinced at this point. I think it is a worthy story line to pursue and I&#8217;m following it closely and I think there&#8217;s certainly reason to continue to aggressively report it. But to answer your question directly, no I&#8217;m not convinced of collusion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If somebody that had no knowledge of this political scandal and the investigations going on were to sort of ask you to summarize what the allegations that have been proven consist of, what would be the most glaring facts that have come to light, that you think warrant further probing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> The number of contacts that took place between close associates of President Trump and Russian government types, or people close to the government. For me, it&#8217;s as much the insistence that these contacts never happened as anything I know about their content at this point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The big story right now, or one of the big stories, is this meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had; Paul Manafort was there, Jared Kushner, the president&#8217;s son-in-law who is the only one of the people that we know was at this meeting that holds an official position in the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the way it was initially reported in The New York Times was that this lawyer was a Kremlin-connected lawyer. The reason I bring that up is because I think in some of the coverage, there is an eagerness to believe that all smoke must mean that there&#8217;s a blazing fire somewhere. And I&#8217;m concerned that in the end, the facts as we understand them, about misconduct perhaps by the Trump Administration are not going to be as salacious as maybe some Democrats and some in the, you know ,the undeniably liberal media want to believe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS: \u003c/strong>I think you&#8217;re right about that. You know, people are very whipped up about this story. You know, I have a very simple point of view on this, which is I think it&#8217;s absolutely worthy of investigation, continued reporting and fair mindedness throughout. You know, which is I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s too much to ask. And in general, I am proud of what The Washington Post has — you know not that I&#8217;m involved in calling the shots at all, I&#8217;m not. But I think the Post has approached it fairly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And has there been too much excitement and, you know, verging on semi-hysteria about it in the news media in general? I&#8217;ve seen some of that. Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>One of your recent columns was titled: &#8220;Are Americans Moved By Trump&#8217;s Media as Enemy War Cry? The Opposite May Be True.&#8221; Talk about what you wrote in that column and what it tells us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> Well this was based in part on some new research from Pew that said that, while people don&#8217;t think that the news media is a very positive force in society right now, it&#8217;s actually changed over the past year in a surprising way. Republicans and conservatives think very poorly of the news media, but it hasn&#8217;t changed. It hasn&#8217;t gotten any worse. It&#8217;s at a low level, very low level, but it hasn&#8217;t changed. So that could lead you to believe and leads me to believe that, you know, whatever Trump is saying about the fake media and all of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake new. It&#8217;s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are. They are the enemy of the people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> It just is confirming what people already think on that side of the aisle, rather than driving them deeper into their corner. Whereas people who lean left or who are independent actually think more positively of the news media one year after all of this disparagement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, again, the numbers are terrible if you care about the independent press ,which I do. But they&#8217;re actually not moving in the direction that you would think if you thought to yourself, well, it must be having some effect that the president is constantly disparaging the free press and, you know, threatening to change libel laws and calling reporters scum and all of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s interesting because Vice President Mike Pence, who himself for a long time, operated in the media as a talk radio host.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mike Pence: \u003c/strong>Is adultery no longer a big deal in Indiana and in America?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>And he actually, when he was in Congress, won praise from some press freedom advocates for his support of a shield law for journalists. And now he&#8217;s, of course, the vice president of an administration that has made clear what you just laid out, that they are contemplating changing libel laws. You know, they stopped just short of using the exact phrases that Joseph Goebbels used to describe the news media, but it really is serious when you consider the war against whistleblowers in this country. But also, the pathological lying that we see on the part of the White House; it does have a whiff of kind of fascist mentality toward the press, Mike Pence&#8217;s past record withstanding.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it is. You know, Pence was one of the co-sponsors in Congress of the shield law, as you say, which still hasn&#8217;t become reality and may never be. But I think we could use it and I think we could use it now more than ever because of the very administration that Pence is a part of. So, I&#8217;m very concerned about it and I agree that at least the language and some of the behavior — the lack of transparency — the fact that, you know, the traditional press briefings, whatever you may think of their usefulness, have become in many cases off-camera. It&#8217;s all pretty worrisome.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kellyanne Conway:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s the conclusion? Collusion? No. We don&#8217;t have that yet. I see illusion and delusion. So, just so we&#8217;re clear, everyone, four words: conclusion, collusion — no. Illusion, delusion — yes. I just thought we&#8217;d have some fun with words.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> But you, Jeremy, just made an allusion to the pursuit of whistleblowers and that&#8217;s something that did not begin with the Obama administration, but the Obama administration really ramped it up. And the use of the 1917 Espionage Act to prosecute sources, whistleblowers — or leakers or traitors — as some would have it, was very, very concerning in the last administration and it really does create something of a blueprint for doing the same thing, but more so, in an administration that&#8217;s extremely press averse. We&#8217;re only six months into the Trump Administration and, as you well know, there&#8217;s already been one leaker who is being charged under the Espionage Act. And I don&#8217;t think it will be the last one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and I mean I don&#8217;t want this to be the elephant in the room here. I mean, what you&#8217;re referring to is this young woman named Reality Winner, who the FBI, in a very political affidavit that the Justice Department swiftly released to the media within moments of The Intercept publishing a story on June 5th that was based on a top secret NSA document that revealed Russian cyber-espionage efforts targeting U.S. software companies that were servicing parts of the U.S. electoral and voting system. And they announced her arrest and slapped her with an espionage charge.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And The Intercept, as it stated publicly, you know, received this document anonymously, and we can&#8217;t confirm that Reality Winner is the source of that. And even if we knew that, we wouldn&#8217;t confirm it based on our principles of source protection. But the fact remains that this Justice Department is really throwing the book at her. And you&#8217;ve written about this recently, you sort of wrote about the statement that our editor-in-chief, Betsy Reed, put out stating that our parent company, First Look, is helping to pay for a set of lawyers to work on her case, as well as making another $50,000 contribution to a defense fund set up in her name.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I&#8217;m curious to ask you, because you are not at all handcuffed in what you can say about this, just looking at this story, the FBI&#8217;s response to this and the way that they&#8217;ve gone after this young woman, what&#8217;s your read on what&#8217;s going on here?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS\u003c/strong>: The Trump Administration has made it clear that leaks are bad — at least not the ones that they like, but then the rest of them — that leaks are evil, that anonymous sources are evil. I think that they are looking to pick a case and go after it hard, and, you know unfortunately, Reality Winner is the one who is going to be the first, probably the first of several or of many. And, you know, as you said, they&#8217;re throwing the book at her and it&#8217;s very concerning. I think that her motivations, if indeed she is the source of your story, and I don&#8217;t expect you to comment on that, I know you wouldn&#8217;t, I think her motivations were to get what she considered valid and possibly important information released to the public.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So in general, I am a fan of whistleblowers and certainly of people who, you know, see something going on that they feel should be made public. I&#8217;m sorry to see this happening and I hope that she&#8217;s treated fairly as the prosecution continues. And I give First Look, The Intercept&#8217;s parent company, a lot of credit for helping to defend her and for standing up for her, whatever the relationship may be between her and your news organization.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I have a lot of respect for Betsy Reed, the editor of The Intercept. And I think it was tough for her to, and I think for all of you because you stand for transparency — that&#8217;s such a huge part of your core mission. I think it&#8217;s been tough and still is not to be able to say everything you might know about this, or to be really out front with it. The circumstances are such that it&#8217;s just not possible. But the actions and the transparency, now, I think of been really valid and very good and admirable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>I appreciate that and, as you know, we definitely have people within our organization pushing for us to say more. At the end of the day, look, we can&#8217;t do anything that&#8217;s going to harm this young woman&#8217;s case and that ultimately is kind of the roadblock to us saying, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s everything we understand about this.&#8221; And you know, I personally wish it wasn&#8217;t that way. I personally wish we could own the mistakes that Betsy referenced The Intercept having made as part of this process. And I hope we will one day fully own all of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The flip side of this is that the FBI has leaked her private conversations, this Reality Winner, with her mother from inside of prison. They&#8217;ve gone into her diaries. They really have attempted to kind of prosecute her in the court of public opinion before she&#8217;s even begun her trial and we should remember, she&#8217;s pled &#8220;Not Guilty&#8221; to this as of now and we have to respect the fact that that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s asserted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS: \u003c/strong>Whenever I&#8217;ve written about any leaker or whistleblower, whether it&#8217;s Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning or Reality Winner, I&#8217;m always so struck by the reader comments that I get both and, you know, right on the story itself or also in my e-mail. It&#8217;s so incredibly split. There are people who see someone like her as a patriot and completely admirable and very brave, and there are people who really want to tell you that this is a traitor and don&#8217;t you understand, classified information is secret for a reason and this is a crime. Period. The court of public opinion is a very undependable one and a very un-unified one in this case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>I wanted to sort of go back a little bit in history and talk about “her e-mails,” so to speak, as a lot of people like to say on Twitter. Now that we have some space between the election campaign, the publication of the Podesta and the DNC emails by Wikileaks, what&#8217;s your sort of, you know, Monday morning quarterbacking of that situation? You know, was it significant? Was it right to publish those? Did it affect the election?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m hardly the first to say this, but I am in agreement with those who think that that story was overplayed, and that it was overplayed because as the campaign got into full flower, we had a candidate in Trump who had very troubling history and was continuing to say outrageous things. And there was an effort to even things up, and the words “false equivalency” are the ones that people mention here. And I agree with that. I think there was false equivalency in trying to bring up the level of how problematic her email practices were, as opposed to all the things that were deeply troubling about Trump, and his campaign, and his background and, you know, so much of what had happened in his history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you&#8217;ll remember the the day in October, very close to the election, when Comey came out and said that the investigation was still alive. And many of us remember seeing the front page of The New York Times that day, that had, I think six stories, and everything above the fold was about this, and you know what the New York Times does, as I know well, as former public editor, does affect the rest of the media ecosystem. And it was a big deal and I think they overplayed it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And also, the same kind of vibe was on display during the Benghazi investigation because the most insane people within the Republican Party were leading the Benghazi investigation and focusing on the most ridiculous, unfounded wild conspiracy theories. We never really got an accurate understanding of exactly what happened. And it&#8217;s sort of like, in both cases, the way that the Republicans dealt with these issues made it so that we couldn&#8217;t actually have an honest debate about &#8220;her emails&#8221; anymore than we could get to the bottom of what happened at Benghazi.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS: \u003c/strong>You know, I remember a big investigation that the New York Times did of what happened in Benghazi that really was very solid and didn&#8217;t completely let her off the hook. But did that resonate the way — I mean, with Fox News, for example, amplifying everything that the Republicans were saying about it and treating it like it was in fact the end of the world, there was no way to actually look at it. And it&#8217;s very hard for the news media to break through that, because you&#8217;re covering the politics of it as well as covering the substance of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>You know, you mention Fox News. I mean, I have long found Fox News either unwatchable or some kind of a stoned entertainment, where you&#8217;re like, “Okay, let&#8217;s all watch Fox News just to kind of, you know, check in on alternate reality.” By the same token, these days, I really find MSNBC almost entirely unwatchable. And I think that they&#8217;re in sort of two different camps in terms of the inherent dishonesty that&#8217;s on display constantly on Fox News. I don&#8217;t think the same is true of MSNBC, but they really have gone all in on almost all of their programs with the belief or pass along almost anything that&#8217;s flung at Donald Trump. And I want to get your take on the state of cable news.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean I&#8217;m leaving out CNN here, because actually I think CNN has not done a terrible job of covering, you know, the Trump White House. And I think Jake Tapper, for instance, has really been fantastic at many points in covering this. But I do find both MSNBC and Fox News virtually unwatchable for their own reasons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, and I think it&#8217;s cable news that people — you know, when people start talking about how much they hate the media or don&#8217;t trust the media, I think they&#8217;re really talking about the extremes of cable news. And while it&#8217;s true, and I agree with you that CNN has done a pretty good job of covering the Trump White House, they also did a terrible job of elevating Donald Trump during the campaign, especially during the primary campaign, and really are in part to blame, if we want to think of it that way, for his success.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The showing of the empty podium as he approached for his rallies and the hours-long broadcasting of his campaign rallies, it had a big effect. You know, it&#8217;s very hard to tell what CNN is. It&#8217;s a split personality always. You know, Fox has been, I think, in general has not hewed closely to the truth in recent years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>And I think your criticisms of MSNBC are valid ones, you know, I mean I don&#8217;t want to come off here as a CNN defender. I completely share in your analysis of the role that they played in the lead-up to Trump taking the presidency. And I have to say, on Fox News, Shepard Smith, and this isn&#8217;t just under Trump, from time to time shows tremendous spine, including debunking assertions that the president makes about things that he supposedly heard on Fox News.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And when Judge Andrew Napolitano turned out to have been the source for Trump saying that Obama had &#8220;tapped Trump Tower,&#8221; Shepard Smith when on the air and said —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS: \u003c/strong>Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time, in any way. Full stop.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>It is interesting, Shepard Smith is one of the people at Fox News, it&#8217;s kind of fascinating to watch these days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right and I mean as recently as a week or so ago, he kind of went into a tirade about the number of lies that were coming out of the Trump White House, which was pretty interesting to see on Fox.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SS:\u003c/strong> If there&#8217;s nothing there, and that&#8217;s what they tell us, they tell us there&#8217;s nothing to this and nothing came of it, there&#8217;s a nothing-burger, it wasn&#8217;t even memorable, didn&#8217;t write it down, didn&#8217;t tell you about it because it wasn&#8217;t anything, so I didn&#8217;t even remember it with a Russian interpreter in the room at Trump Tower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If all of that, why all these laws? Why is it a lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean? You know, my grandmother used to say &#8220;when first we practice — oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.&#8221; The deception, Chris is mind-boggling and there are still people out there who believe we&#8217;re making it up. And one day they&#8217;re going to realize we&#8217;re not and look around and go, &#8220;Where are we? And why are we getting told all these laws?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know people are saying it was his Cronkite moment, but I think that&#8217;s a little bit too far. But it showed a stiff upper lip there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS: \u003c/strong>It did, and I think that Chris Wallace is a very dogged and good interviewer, so it&#8217;s not as if there aren&#8217;t some decent journalists there. But in general, if Fox were your sole source or major source of news you would not be getting, I don&#8217;t think a very good picture of what reality is in, you know, American politics right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>I wanted to ask you what you believe is not being covered or paid enough attention to in our broader media culture, because of the palace intrigue about Trump and Russia, and the sort of insatiable appetite that the public seems to have, or at least that cable news and the papers seem to believe the public has for every minor detail of this Trump investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> I think in general the news media tends to get too caught up in the drama of the process and in politics ,and forgets about the issues that really affect people&#8217;s lives. So that even in the coverage of the very recent healthcare debate, we seem to hear a lot about, you know, what the vote count is in the Senate and who&#8217;s moving in this direction who&#8217;s moving in that direction and certainly a lot less about the effect of these proposed policies on people&#8217;s lives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, there&#8217;s some of that, but it sure isn&#8217;t the major message that comes across. And in general, I don&#8217;t think we do a great job of talking about substantive issues that actually matter to people&#8217;s, you know, real lives, their pocketbooks, their families, the American economy. And we know very well that that is a huge driver for voters and for citizens and certainly a huge mistake that Hillary Clinton made during her campaign in not speaking more directly to that. And Trump did speak to it. I mean, I think he spoke to it disingenuously, but he spoke to it effectively. And I think we see kind of a mirroring of that in the news media, in not putting enough emphasis on actual policy and substance. And it can be a little boring. And I think that we need to find ways to tell it in in ways that will resonate and go to peoples&#8217; emotions and their daily lives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Do you believe that Trump will finish one full term as President?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> I think he will finish the term but he will be besieged at every moment and that he won&#8217;t run for reelection — that Pence will run and lose. My prediction was that Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York senator, will become the first female president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Wow that&#8217;s a stunning prediction. I mea,n I thought for sure you would say Elizabeth Warren, but we&#8217;ll put you in the Kirsten Gillibrand category on that. My money thus far, Margaret, has been on Trump either quitting and sort of saying, “You know, I don&#8217;t need you. I&#8217;m going back to Trump Tower. Schwarzenegger destroyed The Apprentice, I need to make it great again.” Or just croaking from a heart attack because he just eats fast food all the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS: \u003c/strong>Whatever happens, he&#8217;s going to spin it as a victory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Almost everyone in this country would agree with you. Margaret Sullivan, thank you so much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MS:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Margaret Sullivan is the media columnist for The Washington Post. When we come back we&#8217;re going to talk to a professor who was once attacked by CIA mercenaries as he investigated the heroin trade in Vietnam. He has a new book out predicting the fall of the U.S. empire. And his prediction says it won&#8217;t be in the distant future. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical Interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. We are back here on Intercepted. Remember when Donald Trump famously hosted Chinese leader Xi Jinping at his Mar-A-Lago resort and how he now calls Xi his friend and they had this emerging friendship?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well that&#8217;s quite a different portrayal than the tone that Trump struck throughout his presidential campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT: \u003c/strong>China is ripping us off, and who is getting the oil? China! What China is doing to us is horrible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, while Donald Trump extends the U.S. military footprint around the world and killing an astonishing and growing number of civilians, China has quietly and rapidly expanded its own influence without deploying its military on foreign soil. And a new report in the The Wall Street Journal highlights one of the ways that China has been challenging U.S. military supremacy:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Chinese state companies have begun selling aircraft resembling General Atomics Predator and Reaper drones at a fraction of the cost and they&#8217;re selling them to U.S. allies and partners and to other buyers.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to The Wall Street Journal, “China sales have enabled multiple countries, including some with weak legal systems and scant public oversight of the military, to use unmanned aerial vehicles to spy and kill remotely as the US has done on a large scale since 9/11. Among the Pentagon&#8217;s concerns is that advanced drones could be used against American forces. China is now the world&#8217;s third biggest arms seller by value behind the U.S. at number one and Russia.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I bring up this Wall Street Journal story because there is a new book coming out by the historian, Alfred McCoy, that predicts that China is set to surpass the influence of the U.S. globally both militarily and economically by the year 2030.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Alfred McCoy, I should say, is not some Chicken Little. He&#8217;s a serious academic and he has guts. During the Vietnam War, Alfred McCoy, as a young academic traveled to Vietnam and Laos where he was investigating the swelling heroin trade that was emerging during that war. When he got back to the United States and he wrote a book the CIA tried to stop the publication of that book and it&#8217;s now become a classic. It&#8217;s called “The Politics of Heroin.” McCoy also wrote one of the earliest and most prescient books on the post-9/11 CIA torture program and he&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts on U.S. covert action.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The new book that he wrote, which is going to be released in September by Haymarket Books, is called “In the Shadows of the American Century: The Rise and Decline of U.S. Global Power” and I want to share with you part of what McCoy asserts. This is from his book: &#8220;For the majority of Americans, the 2020s will likely be remembered as a demoralizing decade of rising prices, stagnant wages, and fading international competitiveness. After years of swelling deficits, fed by incessant warfare in distant lands. In 2030, the U.S. dollar eventually loses its special status as the world&#8217;s dominant reserve currency. Faced with a fading superpower incapable of paying its bills, China, India, Iran, Russia and other powers provocatively challenge us dominion over the oceans, space, and cyberspace.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That is from the forthcoming book “In the Shadows of the American Century: The Rise and Decline of U.S. Global Power by Alfred McCoy.” McCoy is the Harrington Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and he joins us now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Professor Al McCoy, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alfred McCoy:\u003c/strong> Jeremy, lovely to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Before we start, I just want to say that when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin, I was a terrible student, but I had a very good sense of what classes to take and I actually took one of your classes — I&#8217;m honored that you have now said that I can call you Al, but at the time I took one of your courses and it really opened my eyes to a world that I would end up being invested in later in life, and that is investigating clandestine and covert U.S. operations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I wanted to how to thank you, Al, for helping to put me on the path toward investigative journalism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Thank you Jeremy, that&#8217;s very kind of you to say so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>I wanted to begin by asking you to assess this current moment that we&#8217;re in with Donald Trump. How do you see him in a historical context, and what does his presidency represent about the American Empire?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Through some kind of malign design Donald Trump has divined, has figured out what are the essential pillars of U.S. global power that have sustained Washington&#8217;s hegemony for the past 70 years. And he seems to be setting out to demolish each one of those pillars one by one. Now, it&#8217;s important to realize that the United States is no longer the preeminent global power we were, let&#8217;s say at the end of Eisenhower&#8217;s presidency, back in 1960. Our share of the global economy has declined substantially. We&#8217;re about to be eclipsed by 2030, by China, and become the world&#8217;s number two economic power. The world system is spreading its wealth and there&#8217;s a number of second tier powers, the rise of the European Union, et cetera. It&#8217;s a more complex world, so United States can no longer dictate to the world, or at least much of the world, like we could back in the 1950s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nonetheless, there are presidents, and I say Barack Obama was one of them, George H.W. Bush was another, these presidents — through skillful diplomacy, their knowledge of the international system, their geopolitical skills — they could maximize U.S. influence on the world stage. They could use U.S. military power strategically, deftly. They could lead international coalitions. They could set the international agenda. Trump is turning his back on all of that and I think he&#8217;s accelerating, perhaps markedly, even precipitously, the U.S. decline.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to ask you about a much earlier book that you wrote, Al McCoy, “The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade.” And that details your investigation and it really was what introduced you to this world of covert CIA operations, client states, mercenaries, local proxies, and you also found yourself in conflict with very powerful individuals in the CIA and the national security state because of what you were researching. Talk about that book and the process that led to writing it and how it was eventually published?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Now, almost fifty years ago, looking back, it was an extraordinary experience. In the space of eighteen months to two years, I acquired an amazing education. Up to that point, I was a graduate student looking at the history of colonialism in Southeast Asia, writing articles that had lots of footnotes. I was a library rat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in 1970 and &#8217;71, there were rumors that started coming back from Vietnam, particularly in 1971, that heroin was spreading rapidly in the ranks of the U.S. forces fighting in South Vietnam. And in later research done by the White House, determined that in 1971, 34 percent, one-third of all the American combat troops fighting in South Vietnam, were heavy heroin users. There were more addicts in the ranks of the U.S. Army in South Vietnam than there were in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Vietnam Veteran:\u003c/strong> That was the whole thing about. To keep myself going through the day, to combat, I would get high. I would be under the influence of some type of drugs. And I would — I would feel fear. But after coming down from the drugs, I would stop feeling fear, and that&#8217;s when I would go back to get high again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM: \u003c/strong>And so what I did was I set out to investigate. Where was the opium coming from? Where was the heroin coming from? Who was trafficking it? How is it getting to the troops in their barracks and bunkers across the length and breadth of South Vietnam? Nobody was asking this question. Everyone was reporting on the high level of abuse, but nobody was figuring out where and who.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I started interviewing. I went to Paris. I interviewed the head of the French equivalent of the CIA in Indochina. And he explained to me how during the French Indochina war from 1946 to 1954, they were short of money for covert operations. So, the hill tribes in Laos produced the opium, the aircraft picked it up, they turned it over to the netherworld — the gangsters that controlled Saigon and secured it for the French and that paid for their covert operations. And I said, &#8220;What about now?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t think the pattern&#8217;s changed. I think it&#8217;s still there. You should go and look.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I did. I went to Saigon. I got some top sources in the Vietnamese military. I went into Laos. I hiked into the mountains. I was ambushed by CIA mercenaries and what I discovered was that the CIA&#8217;s contract airline, Air America, was flying into the villages of the Hmong people in Northern Laos — whose main cash crop was opium — and they were picking up the opium and flying it out of the hills. And there were heroin labs. One of the heroin labs, the biggest heroin lab in the world, was run by the commander-in-chief of the Royal Laotian Army, a man whose military budget came entirely from the United States. And they were transforming in those labs the opium into heroin. It was being smuggled into South Vietnam by three cliques controlled by the president, the vice president, and the premier of South Vietnam, and their military allies and distributed to U.S. forces in South Vietnam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the CIA wasn&#8217;t directly involved, but they turned a blind eye to the role of their allies&#8217; involvement in the traffic. What I discovered was the complexities, the complicity, of the CIA in this traffic. And that was a pattern that was repeated in Central America, when the Contras became involved the traffic. The CIA looked the other way as their aircraft and their allies were smuggling cocaine from Colombia through Central America to the United States. Same thing in the one 1980s, during the secret war in Afghanistan, the mujahideen turned to opium. Afghanistan went from supplying zero percent of U.S. heroin supply — soared to 65 percent of the illicit heroin supply for the United States came out of Afghanistan. The CIA sent arms across the border through caravans to the mujahideen fighters and those same caravans came out carrying opium. So a clear pattern.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other thing was when I began to do that investigation and write up the book, I faced enormous pressures. My phone was tapped by the FBI. The IRS — I had an audit as a poverty-stricken graduate student. The Department of Education investigated my graduate fellowship. Friends of mine who had been serving in military intelligence were recruited to spy on me. In other words, what I found was the CIA penetrated every aspect of my life. They, the head of CIA covert operations, a very famous operative name Cord Meyer Jr., visited the offices of Harper and Row, my publisher, and tried to persuade the publisher to suppress the book — hold the contract, just don&#8217;t release the book — claiming that it was a threat to national security.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So what I discovered was not only CIA complicity — complex, compromise relationships with covert allies far away in remote places like Southeast Asia — but also the incredible depth of the penetration of the CIA within US society under the conditions of the Cold War. Every aspect of my life was manipulated by the CIA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Well, and you write in your forthcoming book, “In the Shadows of the American Century,” &#8220;I had crafted a historical method that would prove over the next 40 years of my career surprisingly useful in analyzing a diverse array of foreign policy controversies, CIA alliances with drug lords, the agency&#8217;s propagation of psychological torture, and our spreading state surveillance.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Part of the reason it seems that they were concerned about what you were investigating in Vietnam, Laos, and elsewhere was that you were tapping into something that was an emerging nexus that the CIA would rely on for decades to come.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM: \u003c/strong>Indeed, all of those areas. The method I came up with was very simple. Start far back in the past, as far back as you can go. Go back to the U.S. colonial policy in the Philippines when we started surveillance circa 1898 to pacify the Philippines, and then track it forward, step by step, all the way to the present, keeping in mind that the patterns — the structure of the operation. And then, when you get to the present where it becomes secret, highly classified, and very controversial, you understand the structure. So, you know where to look, what assumptions are likely to be sound, what hypotheses might work, how you can conduct your analysis and that can lead you to an insight.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, let&#8217;s take the case of torture, okay? In the aftermath of the overthrow of the Marcos regime, there was this coterie of military colonels that had plotted an abortive coup, that had sparked a so-called people-powered revolution that put a million Filipinos on the streets of Manila calling for Marcos&#8217; downfall, forcing Washington to provide him with aircraft that flew him out to exile in Hawaii and brought democracy. So I was very interested in who these colonels were.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what I found when I investigated them is that they weren&#8217;t line officers, let&#8217;s say combat officers, they weren&#8217;t even intelligence officers. They were internal security officers who&#8217;d been personally involved in torture. And what I begin to realize is that torture was a transactional experience. That these officers who&#8217;ve been trained by the CIA on how to interrogate and use torture, by the way, that, that as they broke down their victims, they empowered themselves and inspired themselves to this coup to overthrow Marcos.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, that also introduced me to the idea that the CIA was training torturers around the globe. And I figured this out in the 1980s, before it was common knowledge. There was some research in the &#8217;70s, people working on this, but we didn&#8217;t have the full picture. And what I began to figure out was also the the nature of the the methods that that these that these colonels were using. Now, look, these were physical guys that were brutally physically hazed at their militant, military academy, as often happens in such organizations. And so, instead of beating physically their victims, they used something counterintuitive. They didn&#8217;t touch their victims. They used psychological techniques.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so in 2004, when CBS Television published those those photographs from Abu Ghraib prison.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dan Rather: \u003c/strong>This is a picture of an Iraqi prisoner of war, and according to the U.S. Army, Americans did this to him. The Army confiscated some 60 pictures of Iraqi prisoners being mistreated, and in many of the pictures, Americans, both men and women, are laughing, posing, pointing, or giving a thumbs-up. The result? Six Americans are being court-martialed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM: \u003c/strong>There was that famous photograph of an Iraqi detainee standing on a box with his arms outstretched, with phony electrical wires attached to him, he&#8217;d been told that if he lowered his arms, he&#8217;d be shocked, and he had a bag on his head.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I looked at that photo and I said, &#8220;Those are not bad apples. That is CIA doctrinal techniques. The bag is for sensory deprivation, the arms are for self-inflicted pain, those are the two fundamentals techniques a CIA psychological torture.&#8221; And it would not be for another ten years until 2014, when the Senate, the U.S. Senate Senate Intelligence Committee, spent $40 million and reviewed six million CIA documents and came to rather similar conclusions. So the method&#8217;s useful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to transition and ask you how we ended up with national security state that we have today. What I mean is, the NSA, with its vast powers, which of course you document in the book. The CIA employing tactics under what you you&#8217;ve called &#8220;covert netherworld,&#8221; that there is this sense under someone like Barack Obama that we&#8217;re not going to send massive troop deployments around the world, as much as we are going to depend on drones, discreet covert operations, escalated use of Special Operations Forces and CIA paramilitaries. But sort of talk about the post-World War II growth of what now has come to be known as the national security state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM: \u003c/strong>I think the national security state is the instrument the United States used to build and exercise its global hegemony. Looking at the comparative history of empires in the modern age, going back 500 years, the thing that distinguishes the U.S. empire from almost any other, is the reliance upon covert methods. And it&#8217;s a result of an historical moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. empire coincided with the decolonization — the dissolution — of half a dozen European empires that produced 100 new nations, more than half the independent nations on the planet today. And so, U.S. hegemony was being exercised not over colonies, whose sovereignty was compromised, but over independent nation states, who had sovereignty. So, how do you exercise hegemony in non-hegemonic world? You have to do it covertly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in 1947, President Harry Truman, right after World War II, and Congress passed the National Security Act that laid down the bureaucratic apparatus for the U.S. national security state. That National Security Act created the Defense Department, the U.S. Air Force, the CIA, and the National Security Council — the key instruments of the U.S. exercise of global power. And then when the next administration came in, under President Dwight Eisenhower, what he did is he realized that, you know, that there were nations that were becoming independent across the world and that he had to be intervening in these independent nations. And so the only way he could do it was through plausible deniability — you had to intervene in a way that could not be seen. You had to do it covertly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so Eisenhower turned to the CIA, created by Harry Truman, and he transformed it from an organization that originally tried to penetrate the Iron Curtain, to send agents and operatives inside the Iron Curtain. It was a complete disaster. The operatives were captured, they were used to uncover the nets of opposition inside the Soviet Union — it was absolutely counterproductive. Eisenhower turned the CIA away from that misbegotten mission of penetrating the Iron Curtain and instead assigned them the mission of penetrating and controlling the three-quarters of the globe that was on the U.S. side of the Iron Curtain, the free world. And we began to exercise our global hegemony, covertly, through the CIA and allied intelligence agencies. And that&#8217;s been a distinctive aspect of U.S. hegemony since the dawn of American global power in 1945.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know it&#8217;s interesting because there&#8217;s a lot of talk now about foreign interference in the U.S. election, with, you know, exclusively the attention is being focused on: Did Russia interfere in our election? And if so, were they successful in promoting Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton? And in your book, you cite this compilation from Carnegie Mellon University that says between 1946 and 2000, rival superpowers — the United States and the Soviet Union, then Russia—intervened in 117 elections or eleven percent of all the competitive national level contests held worldwide via campaign cash and media disinformation. And then you write: &#8220;Significantly, the United States was responsible for 81 of those attempts, 70 percent of the total.&#8221; Walk us through some of the greatest hits of the CIA and other intelligence agencies in election interference, since the 1940s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> Look, under the colonial empires — Britain, France, Belgium, all the rest — they had district officers and they worked with chiefs, maharajas, emirs, local officials in colonial districts around the globe. And they controlled who was going to be the new emir, who was going to be the new sultan, who was going to be the new maharaja. Ok?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then when all of those nations decolonized and became independent, the fulcrum for the exercise of power shifted from the colonial district to the presidential palace. And so, the United States paid a lot of attention in controlling who were the leaders in those presidential palaces. The U.S. did it through coups and during the period of the 1950s to the 1970s about a quarter of the sovereign states in the world changed government by coups, and they also did it by electoral manipulation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the most famous ones, the one that actually established the capacity of the CIA to do that, was the 1948 elections in Italy, when it looked like the communist and socialist parties were slated for capturing a majority of the seats in parliament, and then forming a government. And you could have on our side of the Iron Curtain, in a very important world power Italy, a legally elected, democratic elected communist government. And so the CIA spent, bargain basement, $1 million. Imagine: Buying Italy for $1 million. Seems like a bargain. And they produced the electoral results of the Christian Democrats, a centrist government. Any time that there was a serious electoral contest in which the outcome was critical to us geopolitical interests the U.S. was intervening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, the difference between that and what we&#8217;ve seen with the 2016 elections in the United States, if you&#8217;re the global hegemony, you are manipulating influencing other people&#8217;s elections. And when we&#8217;re manipulating other people&#8217;s elections we&#8217;re the global power. And when we&#8217;re being manipulated, when other powers are penetrating our society and manipulating our elections, that&#8217;s a sign that we&#8217;re a declining power. And that&#8217;s very serious.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the things you write in the book is, &#8220;Future historians are likely to identify George W. Bush&#8217;s rash invasion of Iraq, in 2003, as the start of America&#8217;s downfall, but instead of the bloodshed that marked the end of so many past empires with cities burning and civilians slaughtered, this 21st century imperial collapse could come relatively quietly through the invisible tendrils of economic contraction or cyber warfare.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Talk about why you seem so convinced that this is inevitable, and how you foresee potential scenarios for the demise of what we now understand as the American empire?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> One of the key things that I think very few people understand, after World War II, the United States became the first world power, the first empire in 1000 years to control both ends of the vast Eurasian continent. Now Eurasia, that enormous landmass, is the epicenter of world power. It&#8217;s got the resources, the people, the civilizations — you&#8217;ve got to control that to control the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The United States, through the NATO alliance in Western Europe and a string of alliances along the Pacific literal with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, controlled the axial ends of the Eurasian landmass. And then we link that with layers of power: treaties, multilateral defense treaties. And then we had fleets. We had hundreds of military bases. By the end of the Cold War, we had about 800 overseas military bases. Most of those were arrayed around the Eurasian landmass. In the last ten years, as drone technology is developed, we&#8217;ve laid the latest layer upon that, which are the drone bases. There are 60 U.S. drone bases that stretch from Sicily all the way to Andersen air base on Guam, and that has been, if you will, the key pillars in the global architecture of U.S. power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And those pillars are starting to crumble. Your organization, The Intercept, last April, had a very important document that leaked out, the transcript of that phone conversation between President Trump and President Duterte of the Philippines.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you read that transcript closely, you know, you can see the waning of U.S. power along the Pacific literal. Donald Trump is calling up — he&#8217;s got a fellow demagogue in the person of Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, who has killed about 8000 people in his so-called drug war. People blown away and bodies dumped in the streets of Manila and Cebu and elsewhere in the country. And he&#8217;s calling up and congratulating him and trying to bond with him, you know, autocrat to autocrat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then Trump shifts the conversation and says, &#8220;Well, we got this problem in Korea. Kim Jong Un is unreliable.&#8221; And Duterte says, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to call China, I&#8217;ll talk to Xi Jinping about that.&#8221; And Trump says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got some very powerful submarines, which we&#8217;re going to have in the area.&#8221; And Duterte says, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m going to call Xi Jinping about that. I&#8217;ll be talking to China.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s clear that Trump is trying to court the man, trying to impress him with U.S. strength, and every time Trump tries to do it, Duterte responds, &#8220;I will call China.&#8221; It&#8217;s a clear indication of China&#8217;s rising power along that Pacific literal. So we are slowly, because of China&#8217;s investment, its development, some of our mismanagement of our relationships and long term trends, those axial ends of Eurasia they&#8217;re crumbling. Our power, our control over that critical continent is weakening, and China&#8217;s control is slowly inexorably increasing and that is going to be a major geopolitical shift.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know? Those invisible movements of power arrayed across the landscape, and then the technological and educational shifts, coming together, means that there are all kinds of ways for the U.S. to lose power, either with a bang or a whimper, but by 2030, it&#8217;s pretty much over for our global dominion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And is that, is that in your opinion a bad thing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM: \u003c/strong>Well, yes it is, and I here, you know, I speak — you could call me, you know a narrow American. But, ok, every empire — if you think we&#8217;ve had empires in the world for about four thousand years. Some have been more benign and beneficent, others have been absolutely brutal. If you want to go to the the most brutal empire I think in human history, the Nazi empire in Europe. It was an empire. It plundered, alright? Much of that mobilization of labor was just raw exploitation. It was the most brutal empire in human history and it collapsed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. empire has been, and so we&#8217;ve had our excesses, Vietnam, we could go on. Afghanistan. There are many problems with the U.S. exercise of its power. But, we have stood for human rights. The world has had 70 years of relative peace, lots of medium-sized wars but nothing like World War I and World War II. There has been an increase in global development, the growth of a global economy, with many inequities, but nonetheless, transnationally, a new middleclass is appearing around the globe. We&#8217;ve stood for labor rights and environmental protection. Our successor powers, China and Russia, are authoritarian regimes.They stand for none of these liberal principles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So you&#8217;ll have the realpolitik exercise of power, all the downsides with none of the upsides, with none of the positive development. I mean, we&#8217;ve stood for women&#8217;s rights, for gay rights, I mean, for human progress, for democracy. You know, we&#8217;ve been flawed in efficacy but we&#8217;ve stood for those principles and we have advanced them. So, we have been on the scale of empires comparatively benign and beneficent. And I don&#8217;t think the succeeding powers are going to be that way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Moreover, there are going to be implications for the United States. Most visibly, I think that when the dollar is no longer the world&#8217;s unchallenged preeminent, global reserve currency, the grand imperial game will be over. Look, what we&#8217;ve been able to do for the last twenty years is we send the world our nicely printed paper, tea notes, and they give us oil and automobiles and computers and technology. We get real goods and they get brightly colored paper. Because of the position of the dollar. When the dollar is no longer the global reserve currency, the cost of goods in the United States is going to skyrocket.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We will not be able to travel the world as we do now. We won&#8217;t be able to enjoy the standard of living we do now. There will be lots of tensions that are going to occur in the society from what will be a major rewriting of the American social contract. This will not be pleasant. It&#8217;s possible, if we look back, we could see Trump&#8217;s election, and all of the problems of the Trump administration as one manifestation of this imperial decline.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right well, Al McCoy, we&#8217;re going to leave it there.

This week on Intercepted: Glenn Greenwald fills in for Jeremy Scahill, and we take a deep dive into the origins and evolution of the Trump-Russia story. Fox News&#8217;s Tucker Carlson and Glenn find something they can actually agree on (the Democratic establishment’s Russia hysteria), but diverge on Tucker’s coverage of immigration and crime. Glenn responds to stories by Peter Beinart and Jeet Heer. And Russian-American writer Masha Gessen explains how conspiracy thinking is a mirror of the leaders we put in power, and why it’s so tempting — and dangerous — to believe in simplistic reasons for Trump’s election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Lost Boys:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Rufio!

This is episode 24 of Intercepted.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Jared Kushner:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Let me be very clear. I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Russia has once again dominated the news cycle in the United States this past week. And as part of that discussion, there have been two articles, one published by Peter Beinart in The Atlantic, and another by Jeet Heer published in The New Republic that criticises, quite harshly, multiple people on the Left who, in their view, have been minimizing the Russia election meddling story. And I think that both of these articles are worth discussing, in part because they do extensively critique my own views, and I’d like to respond. But also, I think they highlight some of the really critical points about how this Russia story has been discussed over the course of the last year in the United States, and what the implications are. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And I have two guests who come at this topic from very different perspectives. One is Tucker Carlson, the host on Fox News, who has become one of the more vocal skeptics on the Russia story, and has been subjected to a wide array of accusations. And the other is the American-Russian journalist Masha Gessen, who is a longtime critic of Vladimir Putin, and yet has also expressed some serious concerns about how this story has been discussed. And I think both of those conversations really get to the heart of what these two articles also raise.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, I want to make a couple of points about both of these articles. One, the one by Peter Beinart, and the one by Jeet Heer. And interestingly, both of them were, I think, rare and commendable good faith attempts to engage the arguments by those of us who have been skeptics on this story from the beginning without purposely distorting our views, or even worse, using innuendo about treason or allegiances to the Kremlin as a way of dismissing or demonizing the arguments about the evidence that we’ve been making. And yet, despite the good faith attempt by both writers in the article to engage the actual arguments without that kind of innuendo, the headline writers for each of these magazines did not have that same integrity. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, I thought it was extremely telling that the headline in The Atlantic over Peter Beinart’s article was “Donald Trump’s Defenders on the Left.” And then the sub-headline was, “Why Some Progressives are Minimizing Russia’s Election Meddling.” And the headline on the New Republic story might even actually be worse. It was “Why the Anti-War Left Should Attack Putin Too.” That’s the headline. And the sub-headline is “His” — being Putin’s — “Leftist Apologist in the U.S. Media Aren’t Just Blind to Russia’s Election Meddling, But to Putin’s Xenophobia and Homophobia.” And the reason I think those headlines are worth flagging is because there is a valid legitimate debate that I think both Beinart and Jeet are trying to have about how persuasive is the evidence that has been presented publicly about whether the Russian government under the direction of Vladimir Putin ordered the hacking, and whether they were actually motivated by a desire to help Trump, as well as whether or not there was actual collusion in those hacking crimes with the Trump campaign.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And my view has been not an ideological one or a partisan one, but simply an epistemological one, that there’s no tangible evidence presented, or virtually none, by the U.S. government to corroborate the claims of the intelligence community. And one can certainly dispute that. One can disagree with it. Lots of people do. But to cast those questions, that skepticism, that comes not only from me but from the other people the New Republic article names, such as Max Blumenthal, and Noam Chomsky, and Oliver Stone, and others — to cast that skepticism about the evidence as being supporters of Donald Trump, or apologists for Vladimir Putin, is really the lowliest kind of rhetorical tactics that has sullied and corrupted U.S. political discourse for many years. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you go back to those who questioned the sufficiency of the evidence about Saddam Hussein’s weapons capability in 2002 and 2003, you find that those who were attacking people who were expressing skepticism were accusing them not of being wrong, but of being sympathizers or apologists for Saddam Hussein. You find that those who were questioning the George Bush/Dick Cheney war on terror were accused not of being wrong, but of being al Qaeda sympathizers. And now you find that those of us who question the sufficiency of the evidence about Russia, the Russia hacking story, or the implications of it, are accused not of being wrong, but of being supporters of Donald Trump or apologists for Vladimir Putin. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And both of these writers, the central point that they’re making in these articles and in critiquing those of us who are skeptical — the story is to say, you can be worried about Russian meddling and Russia hacking without actually trying to rejuvenate a Cold War. They’re saying that they’re in the middle. They’re worried about Russian hacking, but they share the concerns that it would be dangerous to revitalize a Cold War. And yet, even in their article, while they deny that they want a new Cold War, they use language that strongly suggests that’s exactly what their view of the world would provoke, whether intentionally or not.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, Jeet here in his article, for example, has this paragraph that says, “Fighting Trumpism in America is not enough. Leftists have to be ready to battle it in all forms, at home and abroad.” So, while he’s denying that he wants a new Cold War, he’s demanding that leftists battle Putin and Trump and their international ideology in all forms at home and abroad. And this language to me seems to be exactly the language of the traditional Cold War years, that there’s an international ideological movement spreading throughout the world that’s dangerous, that’s coming from the Kremlin, that’s coming from Moscow, and that we as liberals are duty-bound to go fight it, not just here at home, but abroad. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Peter Beinart has a sentence that is even more vivid in terms of the issue of whether it’s really genuine when he says he doesn’t want a Cold War. He says, “In his interview with Tucker Carlson, Max Blumenthal attacked Senator Ben Cardin for calling Russia’s meddling ‘a political Pearl Harbor.’” But, writes Beinart, “in some ways, it’s an apt analogy.” So, you have two nuclear-armed countries who have in the past come very close to nuclear war that would annihilate the species, and the reason those of us who are worried about where this is going are so worried isn’t because we love Vladimir Putin or support Donald Trump. It’s because we’ve seen the effects, the incredibly destructive effects, when this kind of militaristic confrontational rhetoric takes hold of the American opinion elite class, and where that leads to. And it seems, to put it mildly, not worth risking another Cold War, another military confrontation between the United States and Russia, over what, even if you believe the claims of the CIA, notwithstanding that there’s no evidence for it — even if you believe them, it’s nothing more than some garden variety hacking that countries do to one another all the time. And at the very least, I hope going forward that we can have this debate without papering over those actual concerns and trying to suggest that those of us who are skeptical are motivated by nefarious and treasonous motives.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, I think that is an excellent framework for the discussions that I’m about to have. Joining me now is the host of Weeknights on Fox News, Tucker Carlson. Tucker, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Tucker Carlson:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Thanks, Glenn.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I want to begin by observing that if I had to pick one word to describe U.S. political culture in the wake of Trump’s victory, it would probably be ‘manic.’ And I say that for a lot of reasons, primarily the fact that so many people&#8217;s longstanding position seems to be uprooted and kind of scrambled and confused. And a lot of longstanding political alliances and adversaries that have shaped U.S. politics for a long time seem to have shifted in a really short period of time, often radically. And I think that your journey is kind of illustrative of that. Just in the last week alone, for example, you had two very widely discussed — I’d say pretty vituperative exchanges, interviews on your Fox show, one with Max Boot, who’s a longtime pro-war activist. Never met a war he didn’t like.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then to hear you say we need to knock off the Assad regime and things will be better in Syria — you sort of wonder, like, well, maybe you should choose another profession. Selling insurance, house painting. Something you’re good at.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> And the other one is Ralph Peters, who has been a longtime kind of rightwing commentator on Foreign Affairs.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Ralph Peters:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> He assassinates dissidents and journalists. He bombs women and children on purpose in Syria. He is as bad as Hitler. And yet, you want us to align with the Russians, with Iran, with Assad.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I want us to act in America’s interest —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>RP:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So do I.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> And stop making shallow, sweeping moral claims about countries we don’t fully understand, and then hope everything will be fine in the end. If a country we don’t like takes active steps to kill people who are a threat to us, I’m going to pause and applaud.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> And you had very sharp disagreements with them that became kind of hostile. And then in the very same week, you had on your show Max Blumenthal, who is as far to the left as those two have been to the right. And the two of you found a lot of common ground, a lot of harmony on one of the most important or at least widely discussed political issues being discussed, which is Russia.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Max Blumenthal:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> You know, as someone on the left who’s actually gone out and protested Trump, I didn’t expect this hysteria to completely take over. But now I see what the point is of it. Mark my words, Tucker, when Trump is gone, this narrative, this Russia hysteria will be repurposed by the political establishment to attack the left and anyone on the left.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Do you think that you have changed ideologically or politically over the past few years, or do you think there’s kind of a political realignment or readjustment taking place in the wake of Trump’s victory that explains this? Or is it some of both, or none? What’s your view on all that?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I’d say it’s both. I mean, my views have changed. My views are always changing, and I think, you know, one’s views ought to change. You ought to look up every once in awhile from your ideology and measure it against the results that you anticipated, and ask yourself, “Is this working? Are my preconceptions, my assumptions — are they still valid?” And the one, maybe the best thing about Trump’s election is that it forced a lot of people to kind of traipse up to the mental attic and take stock. And so, you know, certain moments shock you out of your stupor and force you to reassess. The Iraq War did that for me. In December of ’03, I went to Iraq after someone I knew was killed there, and I was starting to become suspicious not just of that war, but of the pretext for it, and of the kind of intellectual predicates that led to it. And that experience kind of freed me from a lot of things that I thought I believed, and allowed me to say what I was coming to believe. And Trump’s election, I think, had the same effect. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, one of the really sad things about the mass hysteria that’s descended upon Washington is that it has prevented or at least forestalled like a real discussion about what’s important and what we think about it. And, you know, I’ve never been partisan, but I’ve certainly been — which is to say, I’ve never had an emotional allegiance to a political party. I’ve never worked in politics or anything like that. I’ve mostly voted Republican because I’ve been a right-winger my whole life. But all of a sudden, just because I read for a living, I started seeing pieces that I really agreed with, coming from people not only whom I disagreed with, but with whom I’d been at odds for like decades, including you. In fact, I haven’t done this, but I probably should. It’d be amusing to type in both of our names into Google pre-2015 and see how many pieces each of us has written attacking the other. [Laughs] Quite a few.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Right. I kind of thought the Iraq War was gonna be this fundamental political event for people to change how they thought about a whole range of issues. I mean, I wasn’t even working on politics in 2003. I was practicing law. And that’s a big part of what made me start writing about politics. And for a long time, I thought it was gonna change people&#8217;s views, not just of the wisdom of those kinds of invasions, but the extent to which we trust anonymous sources, claims from the intelligence community, how the media conducts itself, its relationship to those factions. And for a time, I thought that that was happening, and now I think it isn’t. I mean, I think that the prevailing sentiment among the establishment wings of both political parties is this idea that we do place faith in the intelligence community. We do believe there are claims, even when disseminated anonymously. We still believe in the necessity or virtue of U.S. force; not in self-defense, but to produce good in the world and other countries that we barely understand. Talk a little bit more about what changed for you as a result of what had been your support for the Iraq War, and then your ultimate or subsequent view that that was just terribly wrong.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, my support for it was always tepid. Part of the problem for me was I was working on a debate show at the time, Crossfire, on which you sort of had to pick a side. And so, I actually was never comfortable with it. Because I don’t have a super high IQ, I tend to ask the obvious questions, like what does Iraq have to do with 9/11? And I could never get a satisfying answer. So, that made me think, as it always does, if someone can’t give a straight answer that you can understand, either he doesn’t understand it himself, or he’s lying about it. So, it always made me uncomfortable. I was won over to the idea that the government of Saddam Hussein posed this imminent threat to America because of WMD — by someone in the government whom I knew well and was close to from a former life. And he convinced me of that single handedly. And so, I kind of was for it in the last few months. And then I went there, and I was reminded of all the things that I sort of knew were like inchoate thoughts that I had had before. The law of unintended consequences is never gonna be repealed. Like, you don’t know. You think you know what’s gonna happen when you do something, but you really don’t. And so, humility is a prerequisite for wise decision-making. And whenever you have people telling you — people like Max Boot, for example — we know exactly what’s gonna happen when we do this, that’s a tipoff that these are very unwise people who shouldn’t have power. And so, I just thought, boy, this is scary, more than anything, on a political level.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, basically what you saw in Washington is what you’re seeing now, and what I will be against until the day I die, which is hyperventilating group think, where people convince themselves of a thesis and then stop asking critical questions of that thesis. Like, they start with, here’s what we know, okay? Here’s just — here’s what we know. And by the way, if you don’t agree to that fact, like if you ask any questions at all, then you’re clearly, you know, immoral. You’re a sinner. That’s exactly what happened before the Iraq War in Washington, and that’s exactly what’s happening now with this Russia stuff. And by the way, just to skip ahead, I just want to say this emphatically — I’m totally agnostic on Russia. Never been there. I don’t have strong feelings about its government. I’m glad I don’t live there, you know what I mean? I’m like the last person who’s carrying water for Russia, but it’s almost like my main objection is to the psychological phenomenon I’m watching in progress, and it’s totally the product of a ruling class that’s utterly homogenous, not racially, but culturally.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So, one of the things that I found really interesting was, I think before I even went on your show, you interviewed Congressman Adam Schiff of California, who’s a Democrat, who has become, I guess you could say, the leader of the Democrats, in the House at least, when it comes to sounding the shrill alarm about Russia and Trump and the threat that is posed by the Kremlin. And he had that interview with you where you were just simply asking him for evidence of the claims that he was making about Putin ordering these hacks and about the motive that Putin had in doing so.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> You know what?

That’s just so —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This has been one of the things that has concerned me most, because I got into writing about politics in the post 9/11 era, when I felt like there was a lot of equating of criticism of the government or questioning of the government line with treason, or equating of dissent with some kind of suspicion about your loyalties. And I see very much, although different people are doing it, those tactics being used now. Would you agree that these kind of tactics that you’re objecting to now that are often being applied to you have been tactics that the right has used for a long time to kind of delegitimize dissent and questioning of government policies?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> There’s no question. And I hate to think about the degree to which I participated in it, and I don’t want to ever be confronted with video evidence that I’ve done it. I’m sure I have. It’s too easy. It’s too hard to resist. The obvious example that comes to mind is Barbara Lee’s vote against military action in Afghanistan, which by the way, I think is justified, you know. The Taliban were based in Afghanistan. They were a terrible regime. They hosted al Qaeda, which, you know, sent 19 hijackers here and killed 3,000 Americans. So, like, I don’t know. I would still support military action against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. On the other hand, I think in retrospect, it was probably pretty useful to have at least somebody stand up and say, wait a second, you know. How long are we going there? This seems a little open-ended.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Yeah, given that we’re — 16 years later, not only are we still there, but the Taliban’s still there.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Exactly. That’s exactly right. So, yes. To answer your question in a word, yes. This is an old tactic. It’s been employed by the Right. Again, I’m sure it has been employed by me, and I’m ashamed of that. But what I’m so surprised by in this moment, and I’m sure it happened after 9/11 too, and I know it happened during the run up to the Iraq War, is: skepticism is being treated as sinful. And that’s when you know you’re not really part of a policy debate. This is a theological debate. You know these are people looking for apostates. And I just feel like it’s incumbent upon all of us in this business to assert our right to express skepticism. And I have to say, you know, I don’t want to log roll here or, you know, be ass-kissy. But, you know, you wrote a piece a couple of weeks ago in which you went after the press, not on behalf of Trump — you’re obviously not a Trump supporter — but on the basis of their willingness, you attacked them for accepting intelligence information or intel from the intel agencies on a background basis without ever vetting it, and accepting it as true. That is not what we’re supposed to be doing. We’re supposed to be relentlessly skeptical about everything we hear. And the press all of a sudden isn’t, and it’s bad.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> There’s a lot of criticism of you that I think is very partisan in nature, very ideological in nature, stuff that comes from Media Matters and the like that is boring and worthless and worth ignoring. And then there’s some criticism of what you do on your show that I think is at least legitimate and valid enough to discuss. And I wanted to ask you about a couple of those lines of critique.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Sure.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> One of which is the way in which you cover crime, domestic crime in the United States, is extremely selective and designed to advance an agenda as opposed to giving a realistic depiction of what the nature of violence in the United States is. And I wanted to ask you about a couple of areas, the first of which is police abuse. Last week, there were two really talked about cases involving police violence. One was, there’s a police officer in Bald Springs, Texas. His name is Ray Oliver. He’s a white police officer who was indicted for the fatal shooting of a black teenager, Jordan Edwards. News of that indictment broke on July 15th, the same day that the fatal shooting took place in Minneapolis, where a Somali-American police officer shot a white Australian woman. Your show covered the Minneapolis shooting, I think, on at least several occasions, including you emphasizing that the police officer was an immigrant from Somalia, and you asked —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, there’s a lot going on in this story, a lot of we don’t know. Mohammed Noor was an immigrant from Somalia. Is that a relevant fact? We don’t know. But it’s being treated as one by many news organizations. How do you know that? Because they’re not reporting it.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> But didn’t talk about the indictment of this white police officer. Now, I realize, you know, I get criticized for selective coverage, and as one person with one show, you can only cover certain things. You have only an hour each night. You’re gonna necessarily leave out newsworthy stories. But do you think it’s at least a valid point that in choosing which stories to cover, that it’s important not to inflame tensions against particular groups of people, especially given the impact of the platform you have? And do you think it’s a fair critique that you tend to focus on violence when committed by minorities more than violence committed by white people?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I would say part of that criticism is fair. My coverage is selective. I mean, by the nature of the show, I select what to cover, and it’s informed by a lot of other opinions that I have that have nothing to do with the particular crime. Now in this case — I just pulled this up as you were talking — maybe this is embarrassing. I was not aware of the shooting of Jordan Edwards. So, maybe I’m reading the wrong things. I didn’t know that that happened. So, there’s that.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, the case in Minneapolis, like why was that case so interesting to you?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I’ll tell you. Because I’m very upset about immigration in the United States. I think the whole system is destabilizing to the country. I don’t think you can have this much demographic change and not have all kinds of unintended consequences. But the main reason I’m upset by it is because I think it’s driven by economic factors, and I think that the people who are benefiting from it are really disingenuous about that.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> How does this incident shed light on that concern? I mean, this is a guy who came to the U.S. as a kid. By all accounts, he’s been law-abiding his whole life. If he became a police officer — I mean, don’t you see why there’s a view that the reason this case is of interest to a Fox News audience is because of how inflammatory it is? It’s a Somali-American immigrant cop shooting a white woman who’s Australian, whereas the majority of controversies involving police abuse are white police officers shooting black people under suspicious circumstances. And so, if you focus so much on the former and give little attention to the latter, this concern arises that you’re using your platform to fuel resentments against people who are more vulnerable and marginalized.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Right. I hope I’ve been clear on my show and other shows that I’ve had, I am worried about the behavior of police. I’ve defended body cam requirements for all cops for that reason. I am. I don’t like the abuse of power, and I think that some police officers engage in it, and I think they too often get a pass from conservatives. And I’ve said that. I continue to think it. For whatever it’s worth, I’ve been hassled twice in a big way by the police, and I know that it happens, and I don’t like it. Second point I would make, is that I really don’t want to do anything to inflame racial tensions. And so, you know, that’s certainly unintentional. I don’t like that I’m worried about racial tensions in the United States. I’m worried about tribalism. And so, I don’t want to be a part of that at all. I really kind of —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> But there is tension between those two objectives, right? Because you can legitimately be concerned about immigration without having racist motives.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yes.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> And in fact, there was  a lot of concern on the left for a long time about the effect that immigration would have on depressing the wages of U.S. workers. So, no question about that. But at the same time, you would acknowledge, right, that the reason why immigration can be such an inflammatory issue, not just in the U.S. but around the world, is because we are tribal beings by instinct. We have other instincts that balance that, and we can suppress that, like we can with all those things. So, you agree that it’s important at least to be careful in talking about, say, the perils of immigration, if you’re somebody who believes that there are dangers to it, not to inflame those kind of terrible tribal instincts that are certainly part of —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yes.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The immigration debate in the United States and elsewhere.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I do. I do think that. And I’m sure that there are many times when I’ve fallen down in doing that, and not thought through my language enough, or have gotten upset and been unfair. I mean I — you know, that’s a constant struggle for me, to try to be fair even when I’m mad about something, or even when I think there’s a larger and more important point at stake, or again, to be unfair. I don’t want to be unfair. So, I’m sorry if I was.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Fox News:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So, you want to stop all legal immigration?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Absolutely.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>FN:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So, people like, people like me [crosstalk] —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> You, you look at it — no, I’m talking about not a hundred years ago or 50 years ago or 20. I’m talking about 2015. You look into the faces of the tens of millions of unemployed in this country and say, I’m bringing in new people. How does that help you? You have to answer that question. You’re not even trying.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>FN\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">: So, during the Great Depression —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You know, Peter Beinart wrote this article about your show that I largely agree with, which is that he said, you know, even though he disagrees with you on a lot — I forget exactly the terminology, but he said that your show is kind of what conservative cable news could be if it’s intellectually engaging. And he talked about how you advocate positions that are even “too dovish for mainstream Democrats,” including telling Ralph Peters that you don’t even know for certain that Iran is an actual domestic threat to the U.S., which is something that you would never hear any mainstream Democratic politician saying. I agree with the praise that he had for your show. But you had this segment a couple weeks ago that I do think highlights the validity of this critique that I was asking you about. And I have to say, this is the one that bothered me the most, about this friction that you said took place or was emerging between residents of California, Pennsylvania, which is this tiny little town of 6,000 people, and this ethnic Roma population that had come from Romania seeking asylum in the U.S., and I think there was a grand total of like three dozen of them. And the segment kind of played into all of these negative stereotypes about the Roma, who are one of the most marginalized and hated groups on the planet.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Roma are seeking asylum, saying they suffered racism in their native Romania. Immigration is not going well. According to residents, the Roma have little regard, either for the law or public decency. Citizens say they defecate in public, chop the heads off chickens, leave trash everywhere, and more. They’re upset. Some of them are, anywhere. George Eli is a filmmaker who —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It’s this tiny little conflict that, I don’t know, didn’t seem to have any repercussions to me, and had little effect on what I think on your audience other than to kind of inflame tensions about the Roma. I’m just wondering why, with a platform as significant as yours, given the conflicts that are so important in the world to cover, you do cover this. Because I do have to say, it does seem like pandering to the Fox audience when you do stuff like that. I’m just interested in —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I’ll tell you exactly — I’ll tell you exactly why. No, that was sincere on my part. And for whatever it’s worth, I think the Roma are actually kind of interesting, and I’ve read a bunch of books on them just because I’m interested in any culture that remains distinct over a thousand years through a dozen countries. So, I think there’s a lot that’s cool about the Roma. But I personally think that the most marginalized population in America is rural people, or people living in post-industrial parts of the country, whose life expectancy is actually in decline. Now, I live for a fair amount of the year in rural Maine in a post-industrial area that was, you know, all paper companies, timber products. It’s totally collapsed. And I’ve seen this exact thing happen there, where Catholic Charities or Lutheran Social Services or some group that thinks it’s doing good moves refugees into a depressed community and then leaves. And it’s massively disruptive for the people who live there. Massively. And nobody cares. And that drives me insane. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so, if — I guess to be totally blunt with you — if 30 Roma had been moved into, you know, Beverly Hills or Cambridge or Northwest D.C., where I live, you know, I would have felt a lot better about it. I feel like the middle of the country is just a dumping ground for refugees. And the point of it, of course, is to make the people facilitating it feel virtuous, and then they never deal with the consequence. So, what about the people who live there? This is disruptive to them, and nobody cares about them. And that actually drives me bananas. And just the number of people I know who support these policies but never have to face the consequences of them, that’s what it was about. I’m not against the Roma. It’s just, I’m sort of for the people who’ve — who wake up, and they’re like, what is this? Nobody asked me, you know? And that’s what bugs me. I just think that that is a kind of — that’s a ruling class mindset that’s deeply corrupt, and it’s causing this, all this social drama. And I’m for a stable social strata, you know? And these people are making it impossible.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I think that’s totally legitimate. I guess I just think that in addition to those people that are — I mean, it’s just like if you go into, you know, working class neighborhoods that have been decimated by free trade in rural America, and subsumed by the opiate crisis, and are being ignored, you really empathize with the people and what they’re going through, and the effects that these policies have on them. But the same is true if you go into immigrant communities or people who are fleeing hideous situations and coming to kind of embrace the promise of America that all of our, you know, ancestors and the like were able to take advantage of. I mean, you, you start empathizing with their plight too, and the genuine fears that they have over what’s gonna happen to their kids and to their lives as well. So, I think there’s a way to highlight the plight of rural America and working class America without pitting them against groups that are at least as vulnerable, if not more so, particularly given the makeup of the Fox audience and the dangers that those kind of stories can have.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>TC: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you go through New England, which is the region I know best, all the towns along the Merrimack River — Haverhill, Lawrence, Lowell, up in New Hampshire, Manchester — all those towns, the bottom fell out from them economically, right? And somebody decided these were great places to send a lot of refugees. And what are they gonna do? I mean, how cruel. It’s not actually good for the people who live there, and it’s not good for the people who are being imported to there to be moved to a place with no jobs. Like, the whole thing is insane. And nobody ever says anything about it.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So, this was really interesting for me, and I’m super glad we were able to do this.

I’m so happy to be here.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Yeah, I’m happy you’re here as well. And obviously, one of the things that we’re gonna spend a good amount of time talking about is the debate which has dominated the news in the United States for, I guess I’d say roughly the last year or so, which is the debate about Russia and its relationship, both to the United States and to the Trump campaign first, and now the Trump presidency. And one of the things I find very interesting about talking to you about those topics is that this debate has been incredibly polarizing. People are firmly entrenched on one side of the debate or other because of the stakes that are — the high stakes for all parties, and for people&#8217;s political fortunes. And yet, you’ve been, I think, quite nuanced in your commentary and analysis. On the one hand, you are a vehement critic of Vladimir Putin and have been for a long time. You have very, I think, clearly warned of the dangers he poses, not just domestically, but also internationally. \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And yet, on the other side, you have often been skeptical about claims made by the U.S. government concerning the role played by the Russian government and Putin specifically, in hacking, and in other matters. You’ve called for more evidence. You’ve also warned of some of the kind of extreme conspiracy theories and hysteria that has consumed the debate at times. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">And I want to talk to you about the specifics of all of that, but first, I wanted to ask you something that I’ve heard from actually a lot of people who were born in Russia or who were Russian citizens, but have lived in the U.S. for a long time, who have said that the climate in the United States, because of heightened tensions with Russia and the nature of this debate has become kind of oppressive, a little bit intimidating. They feel somewhat like they’re being castigated unfairly as Russians, that everything Russian has become toxic. And I wanted to get your view on that as somebody who was born in Russia, who came — who lived in Russia for a long time recently, and now works in the U.S. What do you see as being the climate here for people who are Russian?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> First, I want to say that I’m not alone in trying to offer a nuanced view. And in fact, I think that people’s willingness to latch onto this conspiracy theory that basically says that, “Russia gave us Trump” is inversely proportionate to their expertise on Russia. The more people know about how Russia works and how Putin works, the less likely they are to sort of embrace it wholeheartedly, which is not to say that they’re denying, or that we’re denying, or that I’m denying that there was any Russian interference. But what I’ve taken to saying is that the possible existence of a conspiracy is a poor excuse for conspiracy thinking.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">But to answer your question about how Russians are perceived, I mean, I haven’t felt it myself, I don’t think. I’m not aware of my friends feeling it. But at the same time, most of my Russian speaking friends are queer New Yorkers, asylum seekers, or asylees who don’t spend a lot of time in the larger sort of Russian immigrant community, which is actually total Trumpland. And that’s been one of the small tragedies of the Trump election, is the way that families of Russian immigrants here or communities have broken apart along this incredibly polarizing line of whether or not they supported Trump.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the larger Russian public, it’s been flattering and fabulous to see that their president has appointed the American president. I mean, Putin took a victory lap after — during his annual press conference in December on the subject of the American election. And he very much feels like the most powerful man in the world. But you know, the fact that I haven’t felt it personally is not to say that I haven’t observed it personally. And most recently, you know, there was a tweet out from Donna Brazile. So, there was a Russian tweet demanding that that property be restituted to the Russians. And Donna Brazile tweeted, “Now communists are dictating policy.” And that, to me —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [Laughing] That’s — I mean, that — it’s amazing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It’s like the apogee of, uh, you know, this completely unselfconsciousness sort of remake of the McCarthy era, but as even more farcical.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, I wanted to ask about a specific comment that you made along those lines in an interview that you did with Slate, where you said, “We’re seeing the reemergence of Russia as the ultimate toxic paintbrush you can scare anyone with, and hope that it ends their political career.” What did you mean by that?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Right, yeah. Unfortunately, when we were talking on the phone, what I said was “smear” and not “scare,” but “scare” works as well. But what I mean is that there’s a definite feeling among Democratic Party operatives that as long as you can taint somebody with a Russia connection, that person’s political career is over.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You know, it’s magical thinking on the face of it. In fact, from everything we know, voters don’t particularly care about Russia. Certainly not Trump voters don’t particularly care about the possible Russia connection. But there is this magical idea that if you sort of create a enough of a cloud, a Russia cloud, and get it to attach to the current administration, it will somehow spell the end of this administration.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> And why do you think that that’s a — and I mean, I think that word actually — I’m glad that you corrected that, because I think it makes even more sense now, and it’s sort of more — it’s a stronger claim that way. Why do you regard that as kind of a smear tactic, or a toxic paintbrush? I mean, what about the view that, you know, Russia is an adversary of the U.S. government, Russia attacked the U.S. through hacking and through other means, Russia is supporting extremist rightwing parties throughout Europe and here in the U.S. as well, and therefore people who meet in secret with Russians ought to be held at least under a suspicious light, if not a guilty one?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, because we live in a world in which Russia is a major player — perhaps not as major as Russia would like to be — but it is still very much sort of a part of world politics. And when it gets to the point where meeting, say, with the Russian ambassador is perceived as somehow suspect, when it’s the ambassador’s job to meet with people. And when we find out that these supposed secret meetings were actual conversations had at cocktail parties during the Republican convention, which is like the purpose of those cocktail parties, is to give people access to one another and to facilitate socializing. That’s what a cocktail party is for, especially at a thing like the Republican convention. And so, when that becomes toxic, then you know, what we see happen is the pathologizing of sort of normal political practices. That breeds paranoia, and that doesn’t actually constitute a response to any real danger. The danger posed by Russia does not reside in conversations with the Russian ambassador.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Obviously, there are differences between the McCarthy era and the climate that is prevailing now among the — which are the fact that Moscow is shaped by a completely different ideology than it was in the ‘50s and ‘60s. But do you think there are similarities in terms of the way in which this kind of, as you call it, a toxic paintbrush is being used as a smear on people to sort of deter them from questioning claims about Russia or from deviating at all from standard orthodoxy within U.S. opinion-making circles?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, absolutely. And I wouldn’t even say that there were similarities. What I would say is that there is a legacy, that the reason that this sort of idea has caught on so fast, and the reason that so many people perceive it as such an effective political tactic is because the reflex is still so familiar, and that’s why, you know, I react so strongly to something like the Donna Brazile tweet or the Time magazine cover from a week ago or two weeks ago that had a picture of Don Jr. on the cover and said, “red handed,” right? Those are clear references to the communist period, to the Cold War. And I find it nauseating that people are willing to claim the legacy of the Cold War so readily because it’s politically expedient.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Now, I wanted to ask you about an article that you wrote in the New York Review of Books in March that was headlined, “Russia: the Conspiracy Trap.” Now, that was four months ago. There have been a lot of headlines made about the Trump/Russia connection since then, not necessarily all of them or even any of them substantive in terms of providing additional evidence. But I’m curious to know whether your views on those particular points have changed significantly over the last four months since you wrote it.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I wouldn’t say they’ve changed significantly. I mean, I think that it’s not quite as strongly intelligence leaks-driven anymore as it was four months ago. My basic issue with the Russia story says the same, which is that I think conspiracy thinking is dangerous to politics. The way I would phrase it now would probably be a little bit different. The way I would phrase it is that conspiracy thinking, in a way, it’s a symmetrical response to the rise of Trump. And Trump has succeeded largely on promoting an aggressively simplified view of the world that basically sort of says, look, you know, this modern, complicated world is too scary to live in. Here’s a recipe for making it simple and livable and comfortable, and not quite as frightening. And the rise of that kind of leader almost always calls for all kinds of conspiracy thinking in the opposition as well. And I feel that that’s exactly what’s happened.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Yeah. That happened among Russians who are —\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Oh, absolutely.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Opposed to Putin?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It’s happened among Russians who are opposed to Putin. And I think that my basic problem with the Russia conspiracy theory remains the same, which is that it’s like the one size fits all theory that tells us how we got Trump, which is that he’s a Russian agent, and that gets us out of the really frightening and complicated task of understanding how Americans voted for Trump, right? And it also creates this idea of how we’re gonna get rid of Trump, which is that magically — and I keep using the word “magically” quite consciously because there is no straight line from any amount of Russia revelations to an impeachment, not to mention that there’s no straight line from impeachment to actually getting rid of Trump. But magically, people believe that if the Russia collusion or the Russia conspiracy is proven, then that will somehow get rid of Trump, and the national nightmare will be over.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> But I want to ask you to zero in for a minute on this specific sentence in your March article from the New York Review of Books, in which you said, “Nor have we yet been given any hard evidence of the act of collusion by Trump officials.” Now, at the time that you wrote that, collusion was used to mean participation by Trump campaign officials in Russian hacking, either before the act itself or working collaboratively with them on how to distribute the fruits of the hacking. The goalposts have kind of been moved about what collusion means ever since the Donald Trump, Jr. emails came out, in which it was proven pretty definitively that Trump officials, including his son, were willing passively to receive dirt about Hillary Clinton from Russian officials, much the way Democrats were willing to receive dirt on Trump from Ukrainian officials or even from Russian officials. But on the question of whether there’s any hard evidence now, four months since you wrote this, showing collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government on criminal actions such as hacking, I personally don’t know of any hard evidence four months later after you wrote this that has been presented publicly. Do you affirm this statement still?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Yes, I absolutely affirm this statement. And furthermore, I would say that what we learned from the Don Jr. email exchange was that he basically said in secret, in a confidential email exchange, exactly the same thing that his father said in public. You know, his father said in public, “Please get the emails addressing the Russians.” You know, it’s actually — this is another hallmark of conspiracy thinking, when we attach more value to something that is said in confidence than to the exact same thing that is said in public.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> If we convince ourselves that the reason Trump won was because the Russians engaged in nefarious behavior and dastardly deeds, and kind of implanted this Manchurian candidate and manipulated corruptly the American political process, which used to be pristine and yield positive results, and that’s the only reason why, was because this bad foreign regime gave us Trump, and then we get to believe that it’s — he’s not really an American phenomenon, which I absolutely think is a big part of what’s going on.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">But I wonder if you agree with the following theory as well about why this conspiracy thinking has become so attractive, which is there is this underlying collective sentiment that you find in a lot of countries, where people are just extraordinarily furious and disgusted with and angry about the prevailing political order. In order to address those underlying positives, we have to kind of confront a lot of unpleasant questions about ourselves, like did we embrace policies as an elite class that kind of recklessly or indifferently trampled over people’s security, and do we need to change those policies in order to prevent those people from continuing to suffer, and embrace radicalism and extremism. And instead, it’s so much easier to just say, oh, this was the Russians who did it, because it relieves us of that responsibility. And I’m wondering, A, if you agree with that, and then B, whether you share my confusion about this eagerness to get rid of Trump. Because even if you get rid of Trump, the sentiments underlying Trump’s election aren’t going anywhere. In fact, they may actually worsen or become more extreme if there’s a perception that their democratic choice has been reversed. And I’m interested in your view on that component of this conspiracy thinking.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So, I think you’re right. I think that part of the reason that the Russia theory’s so compelling is that it gets us out of considering our — you know, us, sort of the educated class, the wealthy, whatever, the political class — out of considering our own culpability for the rise of misery, right, that fuels the rise of somebody like Trump. But I think it’s even more than that. I think it’s — in a way, it’s again, the mirror of that misery, which is that it’s a fear of complexity. It’s — because if you consider what we need to challenge, what kind of sort of accepted political wisdoms need to be challenged in order to really try to come to terms with why people voted for Trump, then all sorts of things that we hold to be self-evident in the contemporary political world begin to topple, and we suddenly find ourselves — and again, by “we,” I mean people who are comfortable in the current political sort of disposition — we sort of find ourselves as disoriented, as frightened of all the things that start tumbling down as the people who voted for Trump. So, it’s a real fear response. It’s the “don’t drag me down into your abyss” kind of response. Because if I look into your abyss, I will find an abyss of my own.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another aspect of it, which is related but distinct, is that the longer this goes on, the longer we watch Trump in power being unhinged, the more compelling the Russia conspiracy becomes for another reason, which is that at least somebody’s in charge. If you imagine that Putin is a cunning mastermind who’s really secretly taking over the world, then at least somebody is in charge. You know, maybe an evil grownup, but a grownup, right? I — having met Putin and having written in great detail about him, can tell you that he is actually not that different from the insane clown president that we have here. And nobody’s in charge. Nobody’s driving the bus.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> So, I know that there are gonna be a large number of people who listen to this discussion who are going to respond with the following. I’m sure you’ve heard it a zillion times. I certainly have. “Okay, it’s all well and good that you’re warning about certain kind of particularly unhinged people engaging in conspiracy theory, but the fact remains that Russia attacked our democracy. Putin ordered the Democrats hacked in order to help Donald Trump get elected, both to sow chaos in the U.S. and weaken our democracy.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I want to ask you about that particular claim by asking you about something that you wrote, again in the New York Review of Books, back in January when Homeland Security issued what it called its report about the election year hacking, which was instantly accepted not just as evidence, but as proof, I think, widely through the U.S. media and kind of the chattering class. And it was issued on behalf of three different intelligence agencies. And it essentially concluded that not only did Russia, the Russian government — not only were the behind the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta’s emails, but that Vladimir Putin himself specifically ordered it with the intention to help the campaign of Donald Trump. And about that report, you wrote, “A close reading of the report shows that it barely supports such a conclusion. And indeed, it barely supports any conclusion.” \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do you still agree that six months later, as of — to this date, that the U.S. government still hasn’t presented any concrete evidence on the kind of original core question of whether not just Russians, but specifically the Russian government, acting under the direction of Vladimir Putin, ordered the hacking of John Podesta and the DNC’s emails? And secondly, do you think that it’s plausible that if America’s top intelligence agencies unite unanimously with high confidence in support of a conclusion, that there’s really any meaningful chance that that’s so fundamentally wrong?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I’m not saying that it’s so fundamentally wrong, right? I’m not in a position to question the claim that John Podesta’s email was hacked on orders of the Russian government. I think the idea that there were personal orders from Putin, you know, at this point, we haven’t seen any evidence. It’s entirely plausible. And it seems reasonable to claim the two email hacks carried out by two different actors were affiliated with the Russian government and possibly carried out on Kremlin orders.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">My issue is with the leap from that to influencing the outcome of the election, right? Because this is where the argument gets problematic. Basically, what the intelligence agencies are arguing is that the Russian government hacked the DNC and used the product of those hacks to influence American public opinion out in the open to help Donald Trump. The illegal and problematic part of it is the hacking. But then, with the participation of the New York Times, the Washington Post, a variety of cable channels, the products of those hacks influenced public opinion, which influenced the outcome of the election. Whether or not that kind of influence was actually legitimate journalistic activity on the part of Americans is something that we need to have a conversation about.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s accept the one claim of fact, right? I mean, you can’t argue about facts. So, I can say I’m not willing to accept that claim of fact unless they show evidence, or I can say, okay, fine, let’s assume that that’s true, which is really what I’m saying. Let’s assume that Russians hacked the DNC and gave the products of those hacks to WikiLeaks. Let’s assume that happened. How does it amount to a Russian conspiracy to influence the election to throw to Donald Trump? It doesn’t. That’s the problem.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>GG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Well, I want to thank you so much, not just for taking the time to talk to me today, but for your work on all of this over the past year. I think it’s been really invaluable the way you brought your expertise about Russia to this debate, which has been sorely lacking in expertise. So, thanks very much for both of things.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>MG:\u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Thank you, Glenn.

The developments coming out of the White House feel like we’re all watching some really twisted mashup of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Project Runway, and a Mr. Bean movie. Dime-store Sopranos reject Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just ten days as White House communications director. Reince Priebus is also out as chief of staff, and General John Kelly is in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> So, I want to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job, General, and we look forward to, if it’s possible, an even better job as chief of staff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>General John Kelly:\u003c/strong> I’ll try, sir. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump is continuing to bash his attorney general and white supremacist Jeff Sessions on Twitter, and he is avoiding him in person. As somebody pointed out on Twitter, there are a million reasons to fire Jeff Sessions, but Donald Trump has probably found the one reason that is not legitimate. Meanwhile, President Trump’s lawyer has said over and over that the President had nothing to do with crafting Don Jr.’s less than truthful response to that whole kerfuffle over his meeting with that Russian lawyer that Jared Kushner was at. Well, now it seems that that’s not exactly true at all. The Washington Post is reporting that Trump actually dictated the statement that Jr. put out. At the same time all of this is happening, the effort to repeal Obamacare and replace it with The Hunger Games — well, that was defeated in an epic humiliation, not just for Donald Trump, but for the Senate’s vile little turtle man, Mitch McConnell.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mitch McConnell:\u003c/strong> I regret that our efforts were simply not enough this time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On Russia, meanwhile, the U.S. Congress authorized sweeping sanctions against Russia, and the White House has indicated that Donald Trump negotiated with the Congress, and that he’s going to sign it. That’s an odd move for a man accused of being Putin’s puppet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin’s been a very strong leader for Russia. I mean, he’s been a lot stronger than our leader — that, I can tell you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Though we should point out that Trump was facing almost certain humiliation if he did veto it because it almost certainly would have been overturned if it went back to the Congress. For his part, Vladimir Putin responded by expelling 755 U.S. diplomatic personnel. I would say that the people rooting for escalated tension with Russia seem to have scored some points on all of this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, last week, Trump also announced a new Pentagon policy, which he appeared not to have informed the Department of Defense about in advance. Donald Trump’s saying on Twitter that he’s going to ban transgender people from serving in any capacity in the U.S. military. The President tweeted, “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory, and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, the Pentagon quickly issued a statement saying that it had not received any official directive from the President, just his tweet, and that it would continue to respect all soldiers in its various forces. This could end up being a bit like Trump’s Muslim ban, and it’s almost certainly going to end up in the courts, if his tweet is actually a reflection of an attempted new policy. But just to put this statement Trump made about the cost, the medical cost associated with transgender soldiers, in perspective, transgender-related care in the military costs about two-and-a-half to eight-and-a-half million dollars. Secret Service protection for Trump Tower? It’s 26.8 million dollars. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips? Yeah, those come in at 20 million dollars. Each one of Trump’s golf outings — and there are a lot of golf outings — they each cost us an average of about three-and-a-half million dollars. Priorities, priorities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Played a lot of golf. He’s played more than most PGA touring professionals play. More than a guy who plays in the PGA tour plays.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, speaking of colossal wastes of money, I encourage people to read the excellent new article by Bill Hartung that was published on TomDispatch over the weekend that takes a meticulous look at plans for military spending under Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The first line of that piece is: “You wouldn’t know it based on the endless cries for more money coming from the military, politicians, and the President, but these are the best of times for the Pentagon.” Hartung combed through all the data. He added up all of the hidden and buried spending. And he calculates that Trump’s military budget would be a whopping 1.09 trillion dollars. Check out that piece. It’s called “The Trillion-Dollar Military Budget,” and it’s on tomdispatch.com.\u003cbr />\nI should say, as I’ve said over and over on this show, the institutions of the CIA and the military are doing just great under Trump. He does not represent a threat to their core interests. If anything, these institutions are entering a golden age of their power, particularly because Trump is such an incompetent, fawning fool when it comes to military ad national security matters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, on that token, Trump is really doing his best to inflame tensions with North Korea after his brilliant “Let China handle it all” strategy fell apart almost immediately. This past weekend, the U.S. flew two B-1 bombers over the Korean Peninsula. That followed last Friday’s intercontinental ballistic missile test by North Korea. That missile that North Korea tested reportedly has a longer range than any previously tested by Pyongyang and — in theory, according to experts — it could reach the U.S. South Korea is now asking the Trump administration for its own new missiles with the capacity to strike deeper into the North.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are not new. Every U.S. president seems to find themselves in a similar situation — a crisis with North Korea. But Donald Trump is pretty erratic and he tends to just spit out whatever he’s thinking, and that can probe very dangerous with North Korea. And it can certainly prove very dangerous with a nuclear-armed North Korea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, when North Korea is discussed in the U.S. media, it’s largely centered around how unstable and crazy Kim Jong-un is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Kim Jong-un, this crazy fat kid that’s running North Korea. He’s not rational. We’re not dealing with — even with someone like Joseph Stalin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How we got here is largely ignored. So, today, we’re gonna take a deep dive into the history of North Korea and its leaders. And we’re joined now by John Feffer. He is the Director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies. He’s also the author of several books, among them, “North Korea, South Korea: U.S. Policy in the Korean Peninsula” and “Powertrip,” which laid out U.S. unilateralism during the George W. Bush administration. John Feffer, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Feffer:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me on your show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How did we get to this situation? Not just with Kim Jong-un in power. How is it that the Korean Peninsula is divided, and what happened in what’s called the Korean War?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Much of what we understand about North Korea today should be based on our understanding of Kim Il-sung and how he came to power. Because at the end of World War II when Korea was divided and North Korea was effectively created, Kim Il-sung was not in Korea. He was actually in Russia. He had spent much of the war in the Soviet Union. He comes back to Korea basically on Soviet ships and he is effectively installed as the leader of North Korea by the Russians, who see him as a kind of pliant client. He also kind of learns from the Soviet model the importance of a strong leader, a leader how commands not only the respect of the population, but is in effect worshipped by the population.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, he merges the idea of a government and of personal authority, and establishes a personality cult which, you know, becomes extraordinarily important in the development of North Korea. Because he leads from 1945, 1946 all the way to his death of 1994, so it’s an extraordinary period of time that he controls the country. And he controls the country in a way that’s, from outside perspective, seems quite successful. In other words, if you look at North Korea and South Korea as they emerge from the Korean War, North Korea develops economically much faster than South Korea. Seems to develop a much more prosperous country in a shorter period of time, using basically the Soviet style command economy strategies. South Korea, not as successful. This is the case up until approximately the early 1970s. So, this model that Kim Il-sung develops attains a credibility, a legitimacy within North Korea, not only on the basis of kind of manufactured reality — if you will, this personality cult — but even by some objective standards, economic standards and social standards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Typically, when that happens, it’s — you have a society that’s cut off from the outside world, and you start to tap into the new generations and ensure that they’re kind of brainwashed into believing that this is the truth, and this is the way the world is. When did that start in North Korea around Kim Il-sung’s identity?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Well, Kim Il-sung came from a very Christian family, and the northern part of kind of Korea was very strongly Christian during the late 19\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> and early 20\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> century. In fact, Pyongyang was really the center of Christian theology. Many people came to Pyongyang to study, including Billy Graham’s wife studied in Pyongyang at the theology center there, which was why Billy Graham was so interested in North Korea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Billy Graham:\u003c/strong> Now, God doesn’t have a body likes yours. He doesn’t look like an American. He doesn’t look like a Korean. God has no body. God is a spirit! And because God is a spirit, he can be everywhere at the same time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Kim Il-sung bases his cult of personality on Christian roots. So you have, for instance, the father and the mother and the son. Kim Il-sung, his first wife, and their first son, Kim Jong-il, form this kind of trinity in the North Korean ideology, very similar to a Christian trinity. Kim Il-sung, through this period, is able to add on to this cult of personality with some indigenous aspects. I mean, of course it was identified as a Communist country, but gradually, over the decades, those Communist elements become superseded by more nationalist elements. And of course, the ideology that maybe people are familiar with is the Juche ideology that Kim Il-sung developed, which is effectively a self-reliant ideology. It says that North Korea really can’t depend on other countries — so, the notion of self-reliance, of nationalist sovereignty, extremely important to North Korean ideology. And Kim Il-sung grafts this on to the personality cult so that you have a rich kind of nationalist underpinning to create a kind of organic one mind, one body ideology, if you will.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Take us from that period through the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, and then the ultimate ascent to power of Kim Jong-il following the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994. What happened from the ‘70s up to the fall of the Soviet Union?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> North Korea, with its kind of Juche ideology, decides not to integrate into the Soviet Comecon or the economic cooperation sphere of the Soviet Union. It establishes itself as a kind of indigenous autonomous economy. So, it is isolated from both the east and the west. South Korea, of course, makes its decision to become a very globalized economy. It will base its economy on trade, on exports, on its integration into the world economy. So, that decision that was made both in the north and the south in the 1970s leads to a pretty extreme divergence in economic performance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And North Korea, because it’s not connected really to any other economic block, cannot compete, really. It cannot generate enough autonomous, indigenous capacity to meet the needs of its population. South Korea advances very rapidly. You know, from the 1960s, South Korea was basically at the level of a sub-Saharan African country. And within the space of one generation, South Korea becomes one of the top industrial powers in the world. So, this divergence is quite dramatic. And it’s really exaggerated or aggravated by the collapse of Communism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>North Korea had the most mechanized agriculture in the region, but that whole system was based on cheap oil — cheap oil either provided subsidized rates by the Soviet Union or China. Suddenly, North Korea faces an enormous crisis. Everything that was based on cheap oil suddenly becomes prohibitively expensive. It becomes impossible, in fact, for North Korean agriculture to survive. And its industrial capacity also drops because it too was based largely on cheap energy. And by 1993, 1994, all it took was a little push. And that little push was basically floods and droughts that tip North Korea over the edge. And so, by 1995, North Korean agriculture had collapsed. Its industry had collapsed. It could no longer feed its population, and it enters into the famine period.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Reporter:\u003c/strong> Inside this orphanage lie babies too easily described as the lucky ones. The survivor of famine are fortunate, for these youngsters are citizens of the world’s last hardline Communist regime, and that puts them to the back of the charity queue in many countries. But international aid in North Korea is still only a trickle. Some European countries and South Africa have sent corn and grain, but the U.S. and others have held back, perhaps hoping the regime collapses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> And that comes right after Kim Il-sung’s death in 1994. So, for a lot of people, this was a sign of the heaven’s displeasure with North Korean leadership. Kim Il-sung dies. The country’s plunged into crisis. The famine kills a lot of people. We don’t know how many — as much as 10 percent of the population of approximately 25 million people in North Korea. But it’s still difficult to find estimates — a famine that lasts from approximately 1995 until 2000.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Also in this period, you have Kim Il-sung’s son, Kim Jong-il, take over — someone who you could say never really wanted to be the leader of a country. I mean, he was a guy who was much more comfortable behind the camera. I think he wanted to be a film director. He loved films. He had this enormous private library of movies. If he could have just sat in a movie theater all day long, he would have been a happy guy. But he’s thrust into this position I don’t think he ever wanted, and he certainly wasn’t — he didn’t have the capacity for. He was not charismatic. He barely uttered any word in public. He didn’t have a kind of — a notion of where he should take the country economically. He manages, by 2000, 2001, to stabilize the country, but it has been knocked backwards significantly. You could say it really hasn’t recovered from that period of the 1990s, even today. I mean, it has some modest economic growth, but it really — I mean, you take a tour of the North Korean countryside, and you know, it still — because energy is expensive, it looks futile. It looks like people, you know, pushing plows instead of tractors. It’s still suffering from the problems it faced in the ‘90s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Another key component of this is that around 1994, the North Koreans begin to invest more heavily in nuclear power, in part to try to offset what you’re describing. Was it actually the case that the nuclear aspiration of North Korea started from that position, or was it always dual-headed with a military aim?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I think it was always two-pronged. It was necessary for North Korea to find some other fuel source, and nuclear power seemed a very alternative. But there was a military component as well. Because from the 1970s on, in part because of South Korea’s economic success and the fact it could invest more money into the military, and in part because it had the United States as an ally — and the U.S. was providing cutting edge technology in the military sector — North Korea fell behind rather rapidly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To level the playing field, well, to have a nuclear capability, that was perceived as a cheap way of coming up to speed, essentially. They were also concerned of course that the United States was, you know, invading other countries around the world and was kind of taking advantage of the unipolar moment that happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union. So, nuclear weapons were not just a way of leveling the playing field with South Korea, but they offered a real deterrent against any possible U.S. intervention, either bombing or actual physical military intervention in the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But on some level, just speaking from a strategic perspective, it was smart on the part of the North Koreans to want to pursue nuclear weapons, given that in the emerging nuclear world, countries with nuclear weapons seemed to have at least some form of an insurance policy from their complete destruction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. If they had not developed nuclear weapons, North Korea probably would not exist today. And that’s an important consideration when we think about what kind of negotiations can solve the current conflict between the United States and North Korea, as well as between North Korea and South Korea. If nuclear weapons serve this critical deterrent function, why on earth would North Korea give them up? Would they give them up simply in exchange for a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War? Well, I mean, North Korea’s asked for a peace treaty, and certainly there are a lot of folks here in the United States and South Korea that support a peace treaty. But honestly, a piece of paper’s probably not gonna substitute for a nuclear deterrent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we have to come up with the different kinds of security guarantees in the process of negotiating with North Korea, as well as acknowledging that, A) North Korea’s not gonna give up its nuclear capability as a precondition for negotiations — which was of course the Obama administration’s articulated position — and they’re not going to give away that nuclear capability after, say, only a week of negotiations, and they say, “Hey, you know, you guys convinced us. We really believe in your sincerity. Thank you for your offers of removing sanctions. We’ll get rid of our nuclear weapons.” No. I mean, they’re not gonna trust us after a week of negotiations. It’s gonna take a while for this trust-building exercise to have any kind of impact on the size and the technical qualifications of North Korea’s nuclear capability.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What’s your read on how the Trump administration’s public posture is being received in Pyongyang, and what this could lead to?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Well, the Trump administration comes in like pretty much every previous administration in its policy toward North Korea, saying that what his predecessors did failed, and he’s gonna do a better job. So, of course, Obama said that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> When it comes to changing Pyongyang’s behavior, it’s tough. It is true that our approach, my approach since I’ve been president, is to not reward bad behavior.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> George W. Bush said that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George W. Bush:\u003c/strong> It’s the intransigence of the North Korean leader that speaks volumes about the process. It is his unwillingness to choose a way forward for his country, a better way forward for his country. It is his decisions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Even Clinton said that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill Clinton:\u003c/strong> North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the threat of nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of nations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> So, that’s nothing new. Obama’s position for eight years was strategic patience. It failed. I mean, it failed obviously. There were no successful negotiations, with the exception of the Leap Day agreement, and that lasted for about a day-and-a-half. And then the Trump administration has discovered, as all other administrations did previously, that, yes, it’s easy to say that the previous government’s position was a failure, but it’s really difficult to come up with a more successful alternative. Trump initially said that he would, you know, as previous administrations said, outsource the problem to the Chinese, get China to solve this problem for the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I actually told them, I said, you’ll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of North Korea, because that’s what it is. It’s a menace right now. So, we’ll see what happens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> And that of course fails on any number of counts. Number one, China does not do the bidding of the United States on foreign policy issues, and number two, China doesn’t have that kind of influence on Pyongyang. Pyongyang assiduously avoids any kind of dependency relationship with China and spurns all of China’s advice, for the most part. So, failing that, of course Trump realized that he couldn’t rely on the Chinese. He tried something else. We’ll do it ourselves. What does that mean? Well, it could mean tighter economic sanctions. It could mean a preemptive military strike. It could mean negotiations. Well, the Trump administration conducted its own strategic review of North Korea policy. The conclusion was that a preemptive military strike was wrong on probably every conceivable count. It would be catastrophic for the United States, and even more so for South Korea and Japan, and of course, North Korea and China. And so, that leaves tighter economic sanctions and negotiations. And I think we get both of those coming out of the administration right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How it’s received? Well, of course, South Korea’s tremendously anxious about any possible attack on North Korea because of course, the South Koreans would suffer the consequences. South Korea would bear virtually the entire brunt of North Korea’s attack, so they don’t want that, obviously. Pyongyang? Well, Pyongyang’s reaction was to have a missile display on the anniversary of Kim Il-sung’s birthday. And so, they trotted out as many missiles as they could find, even if they are not operational, to send a signal that they are ready for any kind of attack, and if the United States were foolish enough to try to take out North Korea’s nuclear testing site, they would respond in kind. And so, that, I think, is where we’re heading.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We have kind of the usual steps towards escalation that every kind of initial government, new administration in the United States faces with North Korea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My hope is that the Trump administration recognizes that, okay, tighter economic sanctions is one possibility. But frankly, we’ve tried that, and it hasn’t really worked. But negotiations? Well, they have worked. They’ve worked in 1994. They even worked during the George W. Bush administration with the six-party talks. Both of those agreements led to effective freezes and even some dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear capability. So, that’s the no brainer, as far as I’m concerned. It’s just a question of whether the Trump administration comes to that realization as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I’m curious at your take on what happened. We don’t know exactly what Barack Obama said to Donald Trump, but it was reported that he basically, like, scared the shit out of Trump when he brought up North Korea as they had their meeting. Do we have reason to be afraid of North Korea right now? And what would you imagine was the content of what Barack Obama actually said to Donald Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Well, I suspect that Obama said to Trump something similar to what Bush said to him during the transition, and Bush we know said two things. He asked Obama please to keep two programs in place, and that was the drone program and the Stuxnet program, the kind of hacking of Iran’s centerfuges that set back their nuclear program. And Obama said, “Okay. I mean, there are other things I’m gonna change.” But Obama held to those two positions. In this go-around, I suspect that Obama said, “Please stick to the drone program,” because Obama, you know, was very much in favor of that. And I suspect he said something similar about a comparable program with North Korea’s nuclear program. In other words, a kind of hacking of the code there that has, from all reports, impeded North Korea’s success rate with its missile launches. I think he also probably said that North Korea is a significant problem, that Trump can avoid it, cannot ignore it. Whether that’s effective, you know, it’s hard to know what gets through to Trump. It’s certainly not wonkish policy advice. Certainly, special pleading gets through to him through Jared Kushner or his daughter. But it’s —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Fox &amp; Friends, John.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> (laughs) That’s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Fox &amp; Friends is the single most important source of information for this White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> That’s true. So —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But the point I’m getting at about — do we actually have something to fear from North Korea? And when I say we, I don’t mean necessarily the United States, but that’s how things get covered here. We always ask how does it affect us personally? But my sense — and I am not by any stretch of the imagination an expert on Korea. I’ve ever been. I’ve never reported on it. So, I’m asking this, I think, with a lot of other people a well. My sense is, if we don’t swat the hornet’s nest, the chances that North Korea’s gonna just attack the United States or even South Korea is like basically nonexistent. And I wrong in that, or is there fear mongering that’s going on?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> No, I think you’re basically correct. The representation of Kim Jong-un as a kind of tyrannical brat or an infant who has no rational goals is incorrect. Number one rational goal for Kim Jong-un is preservation of his own authority and the preservation of his system of government. He knows that any attack of South Korea or the United States would spell the end of North Korea as a country, and of course, by extension, the end of him and his regime. So, pure self-preservation dictates that, no, North Korea’s not going to engage in any kind of attack on a sovereign country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the other hand, just as we fear that Donald Trump might do something entirely unexpected because he’s listening to Fox &amp; Friends, or he has developed, you know, some hobbyhorse notion about a country, that he might indulge in some entirely irrational act that would basically be shooting the United States in the foot and undercutting his own political authority. But he would do it anyway because, you know, he doesn’t think about these things. It is conceivable that Kim Jong-un would do something similar. I would put that in a very remote set of possibilities, but I wouldn’t, you know, exclude it entirely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I would say, you know, basically I’m not worried about North Korea in that way. But there is this kind of if North Korea’s pushed against — to the wall, that it feels like it has absolutely no other choice, that the system, its system is on the brink of collapse anyway, and it’s being threatened by both South Korea and the United States and Japan, and the only way out of that seems to be a military approach, well, it is not inconceivable that they would go that route.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay, John. Really quick speed round here. Who is more likely to use a nuclear weapon, Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un? Brief answer, please.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump. (laughs)\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. Who is more of a narcissist, Kim Jong-un or Donald Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump, absolutely. (laughs) I mean, that’s — it’s a function of American culture. Korean culture doesn’t foster that kind of narcissism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who spends more time on their hair each morning, Kim Jong-un or Donald Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Probably, you know, Donald Trump, ‘cause he’s older and his hair requires that kind of care.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Are both Kim Jong-un’s and Donald Trump’s suits made in China?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> (laughs) Not the North Korean. I mean, Kim Jong-un is either gonna get suits from the West, or they’re going to be produced by the Vinylon factories inside North Korea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your prize is on the way. It’s an amazing North Korean car. It runs totally on Juche.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> (laughs) That’s fabulous. And is this going to be delivered by Amazon drone?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It is, yes. See, we’re trying to have our own peace settlement here between Trump and Kim Jong-un, and I think we’ve figured it out, John. John Feffer, thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me on the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> John Feffer is the Director of Foreign Policy in Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you are listening to Intercepted. When we come back, my colleague Naomi Klein sits down for an exclusive interview with the head of the British Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. We are back here at Intercepted. Donald Trump has a lot in common with Ronald Reagan. Yes, they were both stars of the screen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ronald Reagan:\u003c/strong> A lot of people think they’re born better than others. I’m trying to prove it’s the way you’re raised that counts. But even a monkey brought up in the right surroundings could learn the meaning of decency and honesty.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hugh Grant:\u003c/strong> Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I hear Kelson finally dumped you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But more what I mean is that they both advocated horrid immigration policies. Both tried to convince people of the myth of trickledown economics, that the ultra-rich are gonna bring up the poor. They both fawned over the military and spoke in sort of farcical terms about American greatness while advocating policies that hurt working class people and the poor disproportionately.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RR:\u003c/strong> For those who have abandoned hope, we’ll restore hope, and we’ll welcome them into a great national crusade to make America great again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And of course, Reagan had a kindred ally across the pond in Margaret Thatcher. Now, her rightwing reign marked a very dark period for many, many people in the United Kingdom. Britain now has a Thatcher-ite in power once again in the form of Theresa May, but just barely. When May called for early elections this past summer, she was attempting to consolidate conservative power, and she came ever so close to being beaten by the forces led by Jeremy Corbyn.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jeremy Corbyn: Rise, like lions after slumber\u003cbr />\nIn unvanquishable number!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shake your chains to earth like dew\u003cbr />\nWhich sleep in sleep had fallen on you\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ye are many — they are few! (Crowd cheering)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What made it even more incredible is that Corbyn was simultaneously taking on May while also battling an insurgency from the Tony Blair-ite factions of his own party. Corbyn led Labour to an astonishing 40 percent in the June elections. Jeremy Corbyn is a militant leftist. He’s an anti-imperialist, and he is unapologetic about those things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Will the Prime Minister accept that ten years ago, in 1979, there were 2,750 households in temporary accommodation in London? The current figure is over 25,000, and a further 2,000 people are sleeping on the streets. Does she not agree that people sleeping on the streets of our capital city being charged exorbitant rates, and children being brought up in bed and breakfast hotels is a disgrace to a civilized country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It is an extraordinary thing that he has come so close to winning power in Britain, and that he may well eventually succeed. As Britain becomes accustomed to the realities of life under Theresa May, the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is surging in the polls. Like Bernie Sanders in the U.S. campaign, Corbyn has energized young people. He’s galvanized voters who’d become complacent with the whole system. By the way, Sanders remains the most popular politician in the U.S. In both Corbyn and Sanders, there are great lessons to be learned about confronting seemingly unbeatable entrenched political and financial institutions in our countries.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My colleague Naomi Klein recently sat down with Jeremy Corbyn for a wide-ranging interview, covering everything from Reagan-Thatcher privatization and deregulation policies to lessons the Democratic Party could learn from Corbyn’s surprising electoral successes. Here’s an excerpt of that conversation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Naomi Klein:\u003c/strong> I want to talk about this extraordinary moment we’re in where this project that really began under Thatcher and this country and Reagan in the U.S. is crumbling — the whole so-called consensus that never really was a consensus, that really — the war on the collective, the war on the idea that we can do good things when we get together. That whole thinking has collapsed. But it’s also kind of a dangerous moment, right, when you have a vacuum of ideology, because dangerous ideas are also surging. So, what is the plan to make sure that it is progressive, hopeful ideas that enter into this vacuum that has opened up?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> I think it’s important to put it in the broad sweep of history as well, and you’re quite right on this. I first became involved in political activity as a very young man from my teenage years onwards in the late ‘60s, early ‘70s, and I was a union organizer during the 1970s. And the early ‘70s in Britain were the high point of collective strength in many ways. A lot of what he did was very progressive at the time, public ownership for a number of industries, and also the idea of a security of peoples’ lives through health and social care and pensions at that time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> If this government can find time and money, apparently, to appease the police, how is it they have not found the time to do anything to bring about Democratic control of the police?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> We then heard of somebody called Ronald Reagan in California on Proposition 13.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RR:\u003c/strong> I still say that the answer to our problems in this country, even at the national level, is to have a law that says there is a percentage limit of the peoples’ earnings that government cannot go beyond without the consent of the people. (Crowd cheering)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> And then the ideas of privatization came with rightwing economists aping Milton Friedman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RR:\u003c/strong> And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited. There’s a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics. As government expands, liberty contracts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Margaret Thatcher later on was then heavily into privatization and destruction of the social compact, if you like, of the post-war period.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Margaret Thatcher:\u003c/strong> Let us never forget this fundamental truth. The state has no source of money other than the money people earn themselves. If this state wishes to spend more, it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more. And it’s no good thinking that someone else will pay. That someone else is you. There is no such thing as public money. There is only taxpayers’ money. (Crowd clapping)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> And so, we’ve had this kind of neoliberal economic strand for a long time in Western Europe, and that has meant that we have a deeply divided society and a greater gap between rich and poor in Britain than most other parts of Europe as a result of that. We challenged for the leadership of the Labour Party on the basis of opposition to economic austerity and opposition to the growing gap between the richest and poorest, and the pledge to invest in a growing economy and invest in social justice, if you like. There’s a huge confidence amongst those that are campaigning for ending the wage cap in the public sector for investment in public services. Huge confidence there, and a huge degree of uncertainty by the right and by the conservatives. But you’re right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> They’re losing their confidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> This is a dangerous time because you had the growth of the far right across Europe. We’ve seen the rise of racism in Britain, although it’s been strongly challenged and opposed. We have seen the very large vote Marine Le Pen got in France and the vote that Wilders and other have got across Europe. But I think there’s a confidence developing, particularly amongst young people, that they can do something and the future belongs to them, and also amongst older people that actually, the certainties that a system of real welfare and welfare security brings is something worth fighting for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Right, right. It really strikes me that there has been this slow death of that political project that took off in the late ‘70s and really sped up in the ‘80s. It’s died in stages. And the last stage is the war on the imagination, right? It is that phrase, “There is no alternative,” that’s lasted longest. And I feel like what your campaign has done, and the boldness of the Labour manifesto, and this election campaign has proved that when you put the ideas forward, when you put the bold vision of the world we actually want, not just the opposition to austerity, not just the “no,” but also a picture of the world that could be so much better than we have, that’s when people get excited.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> The strongest message, indeed. The strongest message in the election campaign — I’ve said this at many, many events we held, and some of them were enormous. I said, “Look around the crowd. Look at each other. You’re all different. You’re all unique. You’re all individuals. You have different backgrounds, languages, different ethnic communities, but you’re all united. You’re united in what you actually want in the sense of a collective in society.” And I think the election campaign was a turning point away from the supreme individualism of the right towards the idea that you’re a better society when you have a collective good about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> And if you look around yourselves in this hall tonight, look at each other, who are we? What are we? We’re young, we’re old, we’re black, we’re white, we’re gay, we’re straight. We have disabilities. We don’t have disabilities. We have different experiences, different skillsets. But we all want to contribute to something together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And what about that picture of the world after we win? How important is that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> The picture of the world is a crucial one. It is about what we do here to deal with issues of injustice and inequality and poverty, and above all, hope and opportunity for young people — hope that they can get the college or university, opportunity that they can get a decent job, well paid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also about the contribution we make to the rest of the world and the relationship we have with the rest of the world. So, we want a good trade relationship with Europe. We want a good working relationship with Europe. But it’s also how we approach the rest of the world. I want a foreign policy based on human rights, based on respect for international law, based for recognizing the causes of the refugee flows, the causes of the injustice around the world. And there were some awful events during the election campaign. There was the attack on Westminster itself and on Parliament. There was then the dreadful bomb in Manchester which killed a lot of young women, mainly young women. And then there was an attack on London on London Bridge when a group of people ran amok and killed many.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. And you committed kind of political heresy because you talked about some of the root causes, but yet that resonated with people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Yes. We had a pause in campaigning with agreement with the — of the parties, which I think was the right thing to do. Then we restarted the campaign. I gave a presentation of what security was, and also looked at some of the international links of these things, but not in any way minimizing the horror of what happened or the awful things the individuals did — or the individual in the case of Manchester — did to bring this about. But I said, you’ve got to look at the international context in which there’s been this growth. And I can hear myself like yesterday on February the 15\u003csup>th\u003c/sup>, 2003.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> September 11\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> was a dreadful event. 8,000 deaths in Afghanistan brought back none of those who died in the World Trade Center. Thousands more death in Iraq will not make things right. It will set off a spiral of conflict, of hate, of misery, of desperation that will fuel the wars, the conflict, the terrorism, the depression, and the misery of future generations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> What do you say to some of the world leaders who think that they can only go so far in standing up to Trump? You know, like maybe they’ll put out a sassy meme of some kind, but ultimately, they’re gonna welcome him with open arms. What do you think the stance of other world leaders who claim to stand for progressive values should be in this moment?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC: \u003c/strong>I think you’ve got to meet Trump and discuss with him, as one would with any leader. I was shocked by the language he used during his election campaign, talking about women, about Muslims, about Mexicans, other people in society. I was also appalled at the language he used surrounding the Paris Climate Change discussions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense. They don’t put America first. I do, and I always will. (Crowd clapping)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> I mean, these are serious, serious global issues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> What kind of world are we gonna leave in the future, and what are we doing to this planet? Having worked like you have for a very long time on these issues, the fact that finally India and China in a formal setting came on board with the idea there are limits to emissions, there are limits to pollution, there are limits to what you can do. There is a need to regulate the sea, to control the air quality, etc. For them, the U.S.A. — having come on board under Obama — then walks away under Trump, is beyond sad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won’t be. They won’t be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Crowd cheering)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I want to talk a little bit about the way some of my friends in the United States are feeling right now who were very inspired by this election campaign and by your leadership bid within the Labour Party. I have to tell you that people are feeling a little discouraged right now in the United States. They are up against Trump but they’re also up against a Democratic Party that is fighting them on single payer healthcare, on universal public healthcare, that seems to want to keep charting this very — what they see as a safe, centrist path, but what we’re seeing again and again is it’s not safe because it’s a losing path. It’s not speaking to peoples’ urgent needs for good jobs, for free public education, and affordable healthcare. What do you say to the people who organized for Bernie and are just feeling really frustrated right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Bernie called me the day after our election here. And Bernie comes on to say, “Well done, the campaign. I was interested in your campaigning ideas. Where did you get them from?” And I said, “Well, you, actually.” (laughs) And what I would say to people is: Look, don’t be discouraged. Don’t be discouraged because at the end of the day, human beings want to do things together. They want to do things collectively. And that’s the kind of society all of us are trying to create.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We went into an election campaign in a difficult political position, and we put forward a manifesto that was collective in its approach, was specific in what it would do, in the sense of ending university tuition fees, in the sense of raising minimum income through minimum wage legislation, as well as job protection legislation. We gained the biggest increase in votes for our party since the Second World War. We didn’t win the election. I wish we had. But in that campaign, we changed the debate in exactly the same way Senator Bernie Sanders’s intervention into the Democratic nomination did mobilize a very large number of people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> But that campaign wasn’t ultimately successful within the Democratic Party. Do you think people should keep fighting for the soul of that party?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Well, it’s the soul of the people, isn’t it? I think people should be mobilized on causes and mobilized on issues. But Senator Sanders ran for president calling himself a socialist. Now, the last person to use the word “socialist” in any kind of national campaigning was probably Henry Wallace in 1948 or Eugene Debs before that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Yeah, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> And now you have somebody standing for the Democratic nomination and getting within a whisker of it calling himself a socialist, which he is. Now, you never lose everything. You never win everything. But you do change things. So, what we’ve done is change the terms of debate in this country, and the terms of debate across Europe are changing in terms of: Do you appease the far right and the racists and start blaming every minority for every problem that exists all across Europe, knowing full well that would just lead to some horrible vortex where you get into a nastier and nastier intercommunal racist society? Or do you say, actually, a solution to that housing problem is build more houses and share the ones that you’ve got more fairly. The solution to ill health is have a health service. All these kinds of things. So, you create this sense of collective.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> When you talk about changing the debate, and that’s clearly happened. And one of the places we’ve seen this is in the Grenfell Tower catastrophe. And the way in which this horrific event has been interpreted, it seems, throughout British society, is as extreme evidence of a failed system that does not value human life, that puts a kind of a hierarchy on life, where the people on the outside who are benefiting from the aesthetics of this cladding are valued so much for, you know, their property values than the people on the inside.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> What is exposed was something about modern urban living. This is the borough in London that is the richest in the whole country. That tower had several hundred people living in it. Nobody really knew who was in the block. The whole system collapsed. The building went up in smoke, and the result was a catastrophe and the deaths of a very large number of people. We probably will never know the total number that died there. And the emergency services did everything they possibly could. I make no criticism whatsoever of the police, of the fire, of the ambulance, of the paramedics. They all did everything they could. The reality was, it’s a product of insufficient regulation, of deregulation, and it was a towering inferno of the poor being burnt in the richest borough in the country. And that’s a wakeup call about safety of buildings. It’s a wakeup call about the idea you go forward to this wonderful free market Valhalla of the future by tearing up every regulation like it’s a denial of the opportunities for the private sector.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And I think we learn this lesson again and again during times of crisis when, you know, we’re tested. We can either turn inward and against each other, and we saw a lot of that after 9/11 in the United States, where Muslims were scapegoated, and we lost a lot of liberties in this country and around the world with these draconian laws pushed through. Wars were started in the name of that attack. But we also — these moments of crisis that expose the failures of the system, like Katrina and now Grenfell, can be moments where things really change. But there needs to be an agenda. And it feels like this might be a moment like that in this country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> I think there is a more radical, more socialist principled agenda that’s developing worldwide amongst young people who are being told you’ve got to pay for university when it used to be free, and therefore, your life chances start to disappear. And your health service declines and diminishes, and so you’re encouraged, if you’ve got enough money, to go into private healthcare. So, the whole idea of the community disappears.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. I want to ask you if there’s been a moment that really sticks with you during the campaign or since that is the most hopeful moment you’ve seen, where you could see the country that you want to live in, a glimpse of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Some of the people I meet are quite amazing. There was a gentleman came to our rally in Hastings, which is south coast seaside resort fishing town. He was aged 91. He joined the Labour Party in 1945. Been a Party member ever since then. Very active all his life. And he said this was the most hopeful time of his life. And I just thought, this man has come out to a rally on a Saturday morning at that age because he’s full of hope for young people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, we were characterized as an election campaign that was full of young, idealistic people. Yeah, there were a lot of young people there, many of them with brilliant ideals and brilliant imagination. There were also a lot of older people there who came there saying, “I want something better for my grandchildren. I want something better for society in the future.” It was the coming together of large numbers of people. And the membership of the Labour Party is now somewhere around 600,000, which is the highest it’s been in my lifetime. And we are putting a message out there that’s a very strong one, a very realistic one, about the way the world can be. Are we gonna go down the road of naked individualism, free market operations, and an enormous gap between the richest and the poorest, or are we gonna say, hang on a minute. We’ve got to preserve this planet. We’ve got to give something for everybody, and got to have a collective in society. And so, our manifesto gave that general message but also was very specific about what we’d do on healthcare, housing, social care, and education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Mm-hmm. Well, I really want to thank you for your leadership and for your boldness in doing that, because it isn’t only inspiring people in this country. I think it’s inspiring people around the world who really do need some inspiration right now, particularly in the United States. And, you know, that road that you’re describing I think is the road that leads to Trump, right? Who’s just the epitome of all of that and more.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> And I say thank you very much. But it’s not about you or I as individuals. It’s actually about our responsibility to respond to the needs of people in order to bring about the opportunity for people to understand that different and better world they can live in. And when peoples’ minds are opened up, there is no end to the possibilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK\u003c/strong>: Mm-hmm. Thank you so much, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was Naomi Klein interviewing the leader of the British Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn.

This week on Intercepted: As Erik Prince peddles his plan to privatize the war in Afghanistan on major news networks, Jeremy gives an update on the aftermath of Blackwater’s 2007 massacre of Iraqi civilians at Nisour Square in Baghdad. Intercept reporter Lee Fang lays out how a network of libertarian think tanks called the Atlas Network is insidiously shaping ideological and political infrastructure across the world, especially in Latin America. As the Trump administration has ratcheted up its hostile rhetoric toward Venezuela, we speak with attorney and former Hugo Chavez adviser Eva Golinger about the country’s political turmoil. And we hear Claudia Lizardo of the Caracas-based band, La Pequeña Revancha, talk about her music and hopes for Venezuela.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>[Super President Theme Song]\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Super president!

Thanks for having us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump is on his version of a staycation. Chillin&#8217; at his golf course resort in New Jersey, poppin&#8217; by New York to check on Trump Tower. It would be easy to be confused over what&#8217;s actually different about Trump&#8217;s official vacation, given that he seems to be either watching Fox News or tweeting nonstop, when he&#8217;s not golfing during his presidency when he is not officially on vacation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now I believe firmly in workers taking time off. But if any of us spent nearly as much time on golf courses as Trump, we would have to be competing on the PGA circuit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I love golf, I think it&#8217;s one of the greats, but I don&#8217;t have time — 250 rounds, that&#8217;s more than the guy who plays on the PGA Tour plays. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. No think of it! We don&#8217;t have time for this. We don&#8217;t have time for it. We have to work. We have to work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On today&#8217;s show we&#8217;re going to dive deep into the unfolding crisis in Venezuela and also look at a new investigative report just published by The Intercept. And it details the right-wing agenda in Latin America being pushed by a network of think tanks with deep connections to powerful conservative institutions and funders in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But first I wanted to share an update with listeners who have been following the story of the various iterations of the mercenary company formerly known as Blackwater and its billionaire, radical, right-wing founder Erik Prince.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, before Donald Trump was elected, Erik Prince was almost never seen in public in the U.S. He had set up a new mercenary company, registered it in Hong Kong — he was in business with powerful Chinese businessmen with deep connections to China&#8217;s Communist Party. On occasion, Prince would give interviews from an undisclosed location to Steve Bannon when Bannon was running Breitbart News. But, in general, Erik Prince was out of the public spotlight.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Prince has come out from the cold and he seems to be everywhere. He&#8217;s been on Fox News. He was just on CNN. He&#8217;s written op-eds in The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times. And what Erik Prince is openly pushing now is a plan to privatize the war in Afghanistan — a plan to use his private air force.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Erik Prince would presumably service some sort of mercenary viceroy over these operations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CNN’s Erin Burnett:\u003c/strong> So when you talk about H.R. McMaster, national security adviser, and Steve Bannon, are you still talking to them about these ideas?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Erik Prince:\u003c/strong> The — I would say Gen. McMaster does not like this idea because he is a is a three-star conventional army general, and he is wedded to that idea that the U.S. Army is going to solve this. But I think, for the president, he&#8217;s got to say after sixteen years, when do we, when do we try something different?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we&#8217;ve reported previously on the show Steve Bannon tried to get Defense Secretary James Mattis to take Prince&#8217;s proposal seriously. We understand from reporting in The New York Times that Mattis politely declined. But Erik Prince continues to push publicly for the mercenary option.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EP:\u003c/strong> Here&#8217;s the thing, the U.S. isn&#8217;t doing anything below a core level. Right? That&#8217;s the highest unit of movement of the Afghan Army, they&#8217;re not doing anything at the ground level of the Afghan Army, so this can operate there, operate effectively, and create the off-ramp for the rest of the U.S. forces to leave. Let&#8217;s be done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In addition to all of this: A panel of federal judges ruled last week that a former Blackwater operative who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the Nisour Square massacre, in Baghdad, in September of 2007 should get a new trial. That incident, where at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed, that was the most deadly incident we know of where private military contractors killed Iraqi civilians. They opened fire on cars that were stuck in a crowded traffic circle, and they killed more than a dozen people, including women and children.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This federal court also ruled, and the language of this is just astonishing to me, that the 30-year prison sentences that were given to three other Blackwater shooters that participated in the massacre that day, that they represented “cruel and unusual punishment.” The 30-year prison sentences given to these guys who gunned down a bunch of Iraqi civilians was considered cruel and unusual punishment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now I think 30 years in prison is cruel and unusual punishment. This would not be the case that I would use to make that point. All of those men are scheduled to be resentenced and they may actually walk free depending on what court they get.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now I covered the Nisour Square massacre extensively, particularly the life and death that day of the youngest victim at Nisour Square, a 9-year-old boy named Ali Kinani,  his had to pick parts of his dying son&#8217;s brain from the pavement after he was hit by gunfire fired by Blackwater operatives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill’s “Blackwater’s Youngest Victim”:\u003c/strong> Before September 16, 2007, Mohammed had never heard of Blackwater. Now he thinks of them and that day every waking moment. He remembers that Ali was not supposed to be in his car that day. Mohammed had just pulled away from his family&#8217;s home on his way to pick up his sister Jenan and her children for a visit. Ali came running out of the house.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This ruling from the federal court is a grim symbol of the resurrection of Erik Prince and Blackwater under Donald Trump. It sends a message that impunity is the law of the land. That, coupled with Erik Prince&#8217;s recent embrace by major media outlets and his coziness with the White House, should be cause for grave concern among everyone who cares about principles of democracy, liberty, and accountability.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Erik Prince should be held accountable for the actions of his mercenary force and not interviewed like he&#8217;s just a businessman discussing his latest offerings of widgets. Shame on any news network that interviews Erik Prince and does not confront him with the crimes committed by his private armies. Now, on with the rest of the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We begin today with an incredible story reported by my colleague, Lee Fang, an investigative reporter for The Intercept, and that story details the activities of a network of right-wing think tanks in Latin America. It&#8217;s known as the Atlas Network. The name is an obvious tip of the hat to the right-wing libertarian Ayn Rand&#8217;s novel, &#8220;Atlas Shrugged.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Atlas Network&#8217;s aim is to implement neoliberal, so-called free market economic policies throughout Latin America. But it&#8217;s also aimed at undermining populist progressive movements.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>“Welcome to The Atlas Network”:\u003c/strong> Atlas freedom champions are knocking down barriers to wealth creation, fighting corruption, and fostering free enterprise by reducing the role of government and protecting individual liberty. While politicians operate within the confines of what they consider politically possible, Atlas and our global partners think it&#8217;s more cost effective in the long term to change what is considered politically possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Atlas network has played a key role in what many call a coup against Brazil&#8217;s former president, Dilma Rousseff. The network is deeply immersed in the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. It&#8217;s played a pivotal role in the chaos in Argentina. The Atlas network has received funding from the infamous Koch brothers in the United States and it has also sponsored training sessions with the right-wing provocateur, pretend journalist, James O&#8217;Keefe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In many ways, the Atlas network appears to be a sort of modern day analogue to what the U.S. has long done in Latin America with the Central Intelligence Agency and powerful multinational corporations. Lee Fang has spent months on this investigation, and he joins us now. Lee, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lee Fang:\u003c/strong> Hey, thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s begin just by laying out what the Atlas Network is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so, you know, this is the kind of the very first big look at an organization that played a pivotal role in ideological formation and developing political infrastructure all across the world. The Atlas Network is a relatively small foundation and think tank in Washington D.C. that is basically designed to take the very successful political strategies that have helped shape the modern conservative right in the U.K. and in the U.S. and to duplicate those political infrastructure strategies in country and after country all across the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s very familiar to anyone who kind of follows the Republican Party or the post-Reagan conservative movement to see that, you know, there&#8217;s an array of foundations and think tanks and media organizations that kind of work in tandem to advance a similar policy agenda — a very kind of libertarian, economic, hard right idea of, you know, tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation, privatization, and kind of attacks on organized labor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what the Atlas Network does — they take this model and they train young libertarians and business leaders in country after country on how to duplicate this model in their home country. They fly them in the U.S., they provide training seminars, they teach them fundraising, they teach them political management strategies and they provide seed financing to get these kind of think tanks that are based on the American model or the U.K. model set up, whether it&#8217;s in in Poland or Brazil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our piece focuses on the development of these political strategies in Latin America and how they&#8217;re really reshaping the political landscape across the continent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And I feel like the Atlas Network, in a way, is akin to basically what the U.S. Army School of the Americas was for death squads, where you had officers from various Central Latin American countries brought to the United States, trained in torture techniques, paramilitary techniques, guerrilla war techniques, and then sent back to slaughter their political opponents. This, of course, does not involve you know military slaughtering people, but in that parallel universe of electoral interference it seems like a similar model to what used to be called the U.S. Army School of the Americas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Yeah and I think our piece touches on this dynamic. The National Endowment for Democracy, which was created in the early 80s, under the Reagan administration, to be an arm of American soft power, to basically take money from the State Department and USAID and to finance American friendly nonprofits and NGO groups that would train politicians, that would help shape the media, help shape kind of the political dynamics in the developing world to be more friendly to U.S. foreign policy goals. And this was borne out in the midst of the Cold War, but it&#8217;s, you know, continued since then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In Argentina, the Atlas Network has worked with a whole network of think tanks that train political leaders. They&#8217;re very consciously duplicating the model of the Heritage Foundation or the Manhattan Institute, these very famous American conservative think tanks. And, in fact, not only do they draw upon local billionaires and wealthy kind of industrial conglomerates for money, they also receive financing from the National Endowment for Democracy, this arm of U.S. foreign policy. So, you know, for these think tanks that are part of the Atlas Network that have been pivotal in shaping the political climate in these countries, there is a connection to U.S. foreign policy because they&#8217;re receiving taxpayer money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, also, that they play a similar role that we&#8217;ve seen attempted as the U.S. has tried to kind of mettle in the local politics for much of the post-World War II era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Now you went down to Argentina and you&#8217;ve spent a lot of time obviously investigating the Atlas Network. I want you to talk about Alejandro Chafuen, and what he told you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;m going to let you take the stage on this, but I can&#8217;t help but think that some of the people that you interviewed just reinforced the basic thesis of Naomi Klein&#8217;s seminal work, &#8220;The Shock Doctrine.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Alejandro Chafuen, goes by Alex Chafuen, is Argentine American. He grew up kind of in the Argentine elite in the very turbulent 60s and 70s. You had a lot of attempts and successful military coups during that era with the hard right in Argentina cracking down violently on leftists and suspected leftists. And this was the kind of atmosphere that Chafuen grew up in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He gravitated to libertarian, economic ideas. He was a teenage devotee of Ayn Rand. He went and studied at Grove City College, a very Christian-right College in Pennsylvania, and came back to Argentina very excited about these emerging libertarian ideas that he gleaned from the West. He was brought in was very young to work at the Atlas Network, and after the founder of the Atlas Network, Anthony Fisher, passed away, Chafuen took the reins and he&#8217;s really focused the energy of the Atlas Network into developing an American-style network of libertarian think tanks and countries all across South and Central America, with this special focus in places like Chile, Argentina, Brazil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what Chafuen has done in places like Brazil, he&#8217;s helped set up a network of over 13 different Atlas-backed think tanks. Some of them focused on training young people to embrace  libertarian ideas. Students For Liberty, the libertarian youth group, was very new to Brazil only a few years ago, but now has the largest chapter in the world in Brazil. They set up organizations to basically take Catholic theology and Christian theology and apply them to libertarianism, to make the religious case for these policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They have kind of Heritage Foundation style think tanks now in Brazil that sponsor a blogger known as the Breitbart of Brazil, someone who kind of uses very conspiracy laden ideas to kind of ridicule anyone on the left or anyone associated with the Workers&#8217; Party, the PT party.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, you know, when I talked to Chafuen in Argentina at the Atlas Network Latin America Forum earlier this year, he explained it very clearly that some of these ideas that he&#8217;s developing are at the margins of society, that they aren&#8217;t popular. You know, mass privatization, cracking down on labor unions, cutting taxes for the rich, it&#8217;s not something that comes intrinsically to a lot of these countries he&#8217;s operating in. They are popular ideas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But if you&#8217;re developing a stable of young political leaders, if you&#8217;re developing a foothold at universities, and developing policy papers and concrete plans for when you take power — that when an opportunity arises and in Brazil that&#8217;s a combination of two major factors, you know, decreasing commodity prices, basically sinking the Brazilian economy which once was red hot, and a mix of political and corruption scandals that have plagued all of the major political parties — this has given a ripe opportunity for the Atlas Network backed think tanks to seize the crisis and push their narrow set of ideas. And that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;ve done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The libertarian youth groups organize some of the largest protests in the world against Dilma. Hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions of people taking to the street, to protest Dilma. Folks connected to the network basically making the legal case to push the impeachment effort. Folks working with the major media outlets to try to channel outrage solely on the Workers Party. You know that they&#8217;ve got a crew creating YouTube videos, they have columnists at the major newspapers, they have pundits on television, they channel this outrage at political corruption and center it only on the Workers&#8217; Party, saying it&#8217;s only their fault.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So this has been an incredibly successful strategy and I think Chafuen has acknowledged it. That, you know, you can develop this political infrastructure and so it&#8217;s ready to strike when there is a legitimate crisis, that you can seize upon it and then implement your ideas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You also talked to a guy named Fernando Schüler who is an academic at something called the Instituto Millennium which is another Atlas think tank in Brazil, and he really railed against the unions in Brazil. Is that also part of what we&#8217;re seeing here, the same attempt to undermine organized labor in the United States? Is that part of the core of what we&#8217;re seeing with these Atlas Network think tanks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Fernando Schüler, who&#8217;s a Columbia University-trained academic, someone who&#8217;s very prominent in these libertarian circles in Brazil, he&#8217;s prominent in the Atlas Network, he&#8217;s helped build this political infrastructure. When I interviewed him earlier this year, he really made the point that he&#8217;d like to focus on the institutional hurdles for, you know, his agenda and the biggest institutional hurdle that he identified were labor unions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yeah, you know, this is kind of a fascinating dynamic of the story. I covered the Republican wave in 2010, which was followed by an orchestrated effort to attack the power of organized labor in the United States, with this new wave of Republican governors and Republican legislators, particularly in the Midwest, particularly in states like Wisconsin, they took this new political power and the very first thing they did was weaken their ideological and political opponents. They went after organized labor. They essentially weakened collective bargaining for public sector unions. They implemented right to work laws from, you know, Michigan, Wisconsin, they attempted in Ohio, and Indiana. And the Atlas Network has carefully studied the way that the strategy advanced and what they say is that a network of newly empowered think tanks in the Midwest and in Wisconsin had developed the strategy and pushed it. And when unions and activists had protested they were there for kind of a rapid-response strategy of ridiculing teachers&#8217; unions, of outmaneuvering them in the media.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the same kind of individuals at the think tanks like the MacIver Institute in Wisconsin have given training seminars to the Latin American leaders that are operating in places like Brazil and Argentina. You know, there are folks like James O&#8217;Keefe, a very kind of well-known provocateur who uses these undercover videos to undermine labor unions and other kind of institutions on the left.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He&#8217;s also given talks to Atlas Network to teach them in his ways. So the Atlas Network think tanks not only want to implement big, libertarian policies — you know, in Brazil they&#8217;re talking about privatizing prisons, privatizing education. You know, these ideas that became popular in the United States in the early 90s, they&#8217;re now taking root in Brazil. But they&#8217;re not only doing that. They&#8217;re also thinking very concretely about how to change the structural dynamics in their country and the very focal point for that is weakening organized labor. They see that as the biggest kind of institutional hurdle. That&#8217;s the model that&#8217;s been showcased in the U.S., but that&#8217;s something that we can duplicate in places like Brazil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If you were to tell a narrative about the investigative reporting you&#8217;ve done since Trump, sort of walk people through it and the kinds of issues in stories that you&#8217;ve written. Give us an overview of the of the investigative reporting you&#8217;ve done under Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Towards the end of the political campaign last year, I was talking to some of the editors and some other reporters and, you know, if you look at the Obama Administration, one of the best predictors of public policy on the kind of issue-based level was just personnel. Personnel is policy, if you looked at the Department of Justice and who came in in Obama&#8217;s first term, a lot of the bank-friendly folks, I mean that was a great predictor of Obama not prosecuting the banks responsible for the financial crisis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re just saying that because you hate Democrats, Lee.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Clearly. Clearly. But, you know, we made the very conscious decision that whether it&#8217;s Hillary Clinton or Trump, we would have a laser-like focus on the personnel. These folks play such an outsized role, whether it&#8217;s on climate change, or taxes, or an environmental policy and health care policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So we&#8217;ve carefully taken apart who was appointed to the transition. We&#8217;ve conducted Freedom of Information Act requests to get lists of the political appointments at every single agency. You know, when a new administration comes in they have something like 4,000 political appointments. Below the cabinet level there&#8217;s very little focus on who these people are and what their agenda is — who they&#8217;re meeting with. And you know they have just such broad powers on any given issue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So we&#8217;ve done almost weekly stories on who the Trump Administration is appointing at the EPA, you know we&#8217;ve done a number of stories just showing that the folks handling chemical safety issues, they&#8217;re former chemical lobbyists. The people kind of working on congressional outreach, they previously worked at trade group that represents some of the highest polluting power plants in the country. We&#8217;re just taking a look and cataloguing these conflicts of interest, because I think it&#8217;s important for the public interest for people to know who these people are and to provide some accountability to let the administration know that we&#8217;re monitoring what they&#8217;re doing and we&#8217;re keeping track of who they appoint.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If you had to sort of sketch out who is benefiting most from the seven months or eight months of Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency, what would you say?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> The biggest winner, so far, has been the fossil fuel lobby. There&#8217;s the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. There was these appointments, folks like Scott Pruitt at the EPA, you know this former attorney general who has been basically a handmaiden into the oil and gas and coal industry, to a lower level folks who were all oil and gas or coal lobbyists throughout the Department of Interior and the EPA and the Department of Energy. So Trump&#8217;s been very friendly there. These are basically decisions that are in his hands, you know. He&#8217;s been known to bypass the filibuster, do it all through administrative action.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, they&#8217;re not the only winners. You know we did a story recently looking at basically all the top political appointments at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our attorneys who formerly worked for Goldman Sachs who were to provide some legal services for Goldman Sachs and other major banks. It&#8217;s very likely that we see the rules and kind of restrictions on big banks like capital requirements or the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We&#8217;re likely to see some of the changes coming up, they haven&#8217;t happened yet, but just given the personnel is policy, the tealeaves, looks like Trump is moving that direction. But in terms of one industry winner, its fossil fuels.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;ve done some stories about powerful Democratic lobbyists just laughing off the idea of single payer. What&#8217;s going on with the Democrats and health care, particularly on the issue of single payer?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s complete disarray in the Republican Party in terms of the policy, that they don&#8217;t know what to repeal and replace Obamacare with because Obamacare is based on the 2006 Massachusetts law signed by Mitt Romney, which is based on the Heritage Foundation plan that&#8217;s very friendly to the private sector. You know, that basically maintains a for-profit system of health care.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the Democrats are completely unclear on how to move the ball forward. One very popular idea is single payer, basically having the government act as your insurance company, the government taking care of all of your premiums and deductibles and you basically taking that card to a provider of your choice. This is really taking on a lot of steam recently within the Democratic base, but it&#8217;s not clear where this is going. You know, for-profit health care interests still have a tremendous level of power within the Democratic elite, within the Democratic Party. Health insurance and hospital and medical device and pharmaceutical lobbyists are the biggest fundraisers for the Democratic Party. They have board seats at the largest Democratic Party apparatus organizations, you know, the big think tanks and foundations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You reference a story we did recently, Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic House Leader, now kind of like, he&#8217;s been a super delegate and a DNC member, I mean he is also on the board of a health insurance company, Centene. We obtained audio from the recent Centene Annual Investor event, and he&#8217;s at a ritzy kind of hotel and one of the health insurance executives at this event had asked Gephardt to come and basically give his point of view on where the Democrats stand on health care, and they said, &#8220;Is there any threat of single payer happening because that&#8217;s basically an existential threat to our industry, it would replace us?&#8221; Dick Gephardt just laughed this off and said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dick Gephardt:\u003c/strong> There is no way you could pass single payer in any intermediate future. This is the greatest health care system in the world, bar none. If you look around the world where they have single payer, I think you will find, yeah it covers more people, but they do not have the quality and they do not have the innovation that we get because of the involvement of the private sector in our healthcare system. And I think that will defeat single payer approaches now and in the future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Voice:\u003c/strong> Here here! Put me down as agreeing with Leader Gephardt!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Centene pays Dick Gephardt a lot, and just like a lot of these for-profit health care insurers, all of which have the potential to lose profits, if not be completely replaced by a single payer-type system, have a lot of skin in the game. So they&#8217;ve used their apparatus to influence the debate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think for anyone interested in this question of where the Democrats stand on single payer, you have to look at a, I believe it&#8217;s a 2006 or 2007 document that was leaked by a whistle blower at a health insurance company. After the movie Sicko, from Michael Moore, came out kind of criticizing the American health care system and calling for a single payer, you know, single provider-type plan the health insurance industry, through its main trade group, AHIP, America&#8217;s Health Insurance Plans, tapped a P.R. firm and said, &#8220;You know, how do we prevent America from moving toward single payer?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is, you know, back in 2007, or so. And they said, &#8220;Well here&#8217;s what you do. You know you can use Republicans to go after, after the ideas, you know, call it communism, call it socialism, demonize it but you also have to work equally aggressively within the Democratic Party. What you need to do is you need to work with a centrist, third way-style, think tanks, get people on TV saying that this would divide the party, this is too dangerous, this would alienate moderates and suburban voters. You need to tap former Democrat politicians, get them to write op-eds and disparage the idea. You need to shift the public debate. And then you need to offer for-profit health care as a proactive player to basically co-opt the debate.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s an old document now, 10 years old, but that&#8217;s essentially what we&#8217;re seeing on, at least publicly what&#8217;s going on. Even though there&#8217;s a demand from the grassroots and from some of the left-wing labor unions to move toward single payer, there&#8217;s a very hasty effort to smother any momentum before it kind of breaks out and takes on a role of its own.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who do you see emerging as the Democrats&#8217; preferred candidates for the 2020 election. It&#8217;s interesting, Margaret Sullivan of The Washington Post, when I talked to her recently, she predicted that Kirsten Gillibrand was going to get the nomination for the Democrats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> I think that&#8217;s a very interesting proposition. Gillibrand has roots as a centrist Democrat who promoted, like the N.R.A. and these type of institutions that are now anathema to the Democratic Party. But she&#8217;s moved steadily to the left. She said nice things about single payer, kind of tipping her hat to this new movement. She&#8217;s also voted against almost all of Trump&#8217;s nominees. I think positioning herself as an opponent of the Trump Administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But you know folks like Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, these are folks that I think the center of power within the party are taking a hard look at. But, you know, also folks like Senator Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota, Governor Hickenlooper in Colorado. But the party is very hesitant to embrace any kind of Bernie Sanders or Keith Ellison-style candidate. They&#8217;ve kind of deployed their proxies to smear any attempt to position these type of politicians for 2020.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, it is kind of absurd that we&#8217;re here in 2017, already having this debate, when there&#8217;s so much else at stake and there&#8217;s so many other big elections this year next that will come before all of this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, of course, and the 2018 elections are going to be really interesting. Particularly, I mean, if Trump thinks it&#8217;s bad now, if there is an actual adversarial relationship with the Senate, it will change the game at least in some measure in Washington.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LF:\u003c/strong> Yeah, can you imagine, like you&#8217;ve already seen the Trump freak-out over Robert Mueller and that investigation. If Democrats control either chamber of Congress after the midterms and have their own subpoena power, you know, that&#8217;s going to be kind of endless political battles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the question is: Will Democrats use that to just narrowly focused on Russia or do they subpoena all these sprawling conflicts of interest, when it&#8217;s clear that private industry, oil and gas industry, are in the driver&#8217;s seat. If Democrats take back power in Congress will they start investigating that side of Trump corruption as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right.

And Donald Trump, as everyone knows, loves to hate the New York Times. He&#8217;s obsessed with that newspaper, constantly deriding it as a financially failing purveyor of fake news. The Times, in recent days, responded to some of Trump&#8217;s attacks using a language that Trump clearly loves. The New York Times pointing out that its stock is up fifty percent this year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But despite this public catfight, The Times and Trump seem to be on the same page when it comes to the crisis in Venezuela. Last week, the Trump Administration announced that it had designated President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials, meaning that they&#8217;re freezing their U.S. assets and also barring Americans from doing business with them personally. The Times called that the best way to confront the Venezuelan government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The New York Times, though, went a step further calling on European and other nations to join what it called &#8220;a quarantine&#8221; — that was the word that they used — a quarantine of Maduro. That&#8217;s an interesting word choice. That was also the term used back in the 1960s for the beginning stages of the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba, which, of course, lasted for decades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Interestingly none of these players — Trump or the New York Times — are calling for a boycott Venezuelan oil, which the U.S. buys a lot of. U.S. hostile posturing towards Venezuela is nothing new. Washington under both Democrats and Republicans loathed the late Hugo Chavez and his Bolivarian Revolution. Chavez also enjoyed sticking it to Washington and he viewed each attack against him as a badge of honor in his struggle against Yankee imperialism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hugo Chavez:\u003c/strong> [translated from Spanish We — Piece of shit Yankees, know this! We are resolved to be free, whatever may happen, and no matter the cost. Enough, enough, of your shit, Yankees. Enough —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>:Hugo Chavez&#8217;s successor, Maduro, does not have nearly the charisma or credibility of Chavez. And Maduro&#8217;s recent actions have been disturbing even to some of Chavez&#8217;s closest allies. On July 30th, the Venezuelan government held an election for a constituent assembly to rewrite the country&#8217;s constitution. For many seasoned observers, this whole affair reeks of an effort to consolidate power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The vote for this constituent assembly was boycotted by many Venezuelans, and when the official results were announced, it was pretty clear that the tally had been tampered with. To discuss this complex, unfolding situation, I&#8217;m joined now by attorney Eva Golinger. She was one of Hugo Chavez&#8217;s most prominent supporters. She was very close to the late president. She knows many of the players in Venezuela personally, including its current president, Nicolas Maduro. Eva is also the author of several books including &#8220;The Chavez Code,&#8221; which is based on documents that she obtained that detail the U.S. interference in Venezuela, including the brief coup against Chavez during the Bush administration. Eva, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Eva Golinger:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your response to what&#8217;s coming out of this administration and from the New York Times about the situation in Venezuela.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s been an ongoing escalation coming out of the United States government against the Venezuelan government, since Hugo Chavez was in power. And we&#8217;ve seen an increase over the years as the Venezuelan government has sort of dug in deeper with their ideological model, leaning more towards this anti-imperialist alliance internationally, the more they&#8217;ve opened themselves up to countries like Russia, and China, and Iran, and then taken a position that is adversarial to the U.S. So it&#8217;s nothing new, it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s — it&#8217;s more direct.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean it was President Obama who declared Venezuela an &#8220;unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States&#8221; and put the first sort of sanctions on Venezuela, officially. I mean from the time Chavez first was elected in &#8217;98, those initial years when he didn&#8217;t comply with what the U.S. was looking for, and always had in Venezuela as a client state, that&#8217;s when the U.S. backed a coup against Chavez in 2002, and subsequently that sort of aggression just began increasing over the years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ari Fleischer: \u003c/strong>Let me share with you the Administration&#8217;s thoughts about what is taking place in Venezuela. We know the action encouraged by the Chavez government provoked this crisis. The Chavez government suppressed peaceful demonstration, fired on unarmed peaceful protesters, resulting in 10 killed and 100 wounded. That is what took place and a transitional, civilian government has been installed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Venezuela is one of the principal suppliers of oil to the U.S. I mean it&#8217;s a commercial relationship. They’re interdependent. And there&#8217;s a lot of rhetoric back and forth. And, yes, there&#8217;s definitely an escalation of it now under Trump because the people sort of, pushing this this particular escalation, right now, that have Trump&#8217;s ear, are the more reactionary sectors of the Republican Party. You know, Marco Rubio, for example.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Marco Rubio:\u003c/strong> I think the Administration is handling this very well, very calibrated. For every step that Maduro has taken, there&#8217;s a response from this administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> They&#8217;ve been looking for a way to, you know, push regime change in Venezuela. But it really has nothing to do with a change in policy. It&#8217;s been a state policy of the United States towards Venezuela since the Chavez government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What did you make of Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s statement this week, where he said he condemns violence on all sides?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s a giant piece of the narrative that&#8217;s been missing on what&#8217;s been taking place in Venezuela. You see a lot, I mean particularly here in the U.S., in the New York Times, in The Washington Post, in The Wall Street Journal, other media: CNN, you know, NBC. You hear a lot about you know these opposition protests being repressed by the government, but you&#8217;re not getting a full picture because while there is, you know, a state reaction taking place, there is repression with tear gas and rubber bullets, you&#8217;re not seeing the other side of it which is that those are not exactly peaceful democratic protests.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, there are smaller factions. I mean there are parts of the opposition in Venezuela that act within a democratic framework, but there is a very violent faction that&#8217;s gotten out of control. It&#8217;s anarchical. I mean they, where they&#8217;re using Molotov cocktails, homemade bombs and weapons, and they&#8217;re using them against the state security forces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I mean so it&#8217;s really an equal number of deaths on both sides. And overall, I mean, the opposition leadership, the anti-government leadership in Venezuela, have been reluctant to come out and fully condemn you know those types of violent protests. In, fact they&#8217;ve been encouraging them. Because they&#8217;ve seen it as sort of this way to, you know, heat up the streets to pressure the government to — I mean, overall, what they&#8217;ve been looking for is for Maduro to resign, for regime change, which they&#8217;ve been unsuccessful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to just ask you directly if you believe that this recent voting for a national constituent assembly — do you believe that that was a legitimate, free, fair vote, and that the tallies announced by the government are accurate?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s a lot of indication that it wasn&#8217;t a free and fair vote. That the tallies are not accurate but, in the end it didn&#8217;t matter, because they pushed forward with this election of delegates to a constituent assembly to rewrite a constitution that was already one of the most lauded constitutions in the world, that had been done and written by a very participatory open process, that was led in fact by Hugo Chavez in 1999.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So there was a lot of questioning, including from myself, as to why would this be the answer to Venezuela&#8217;s problems, now, when we already had a constitution there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, so why did they do it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> I mean, in the end, that vote was just about choosing the slates of people that had already been nominated by the government&#8217;s party to participate in rewriting a constitution. It didn&#8217;t matter in the end how many votes they got, the fact that the numbers may have been fudged by the government is absolutely an absurd move on their part, because they were just trying to posture in front of the opposition who had conducted an — also, an unverified and unofficial plebiscite weeks earlier where they say they got, you know, over seven million votes saying that they didn&#8217;t want this process to happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know, it was really just sort of a back and forth show off between both sides in terms of the numbers. But it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered. Had the government gotten four million votes, it still would have gone forward. Why are they doing it —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, it matters because you know people who play with votes that is an inherently sort of authoritarian move to fabricate vote tallies. You know, Saddam Hussein used to win by 101 percent of the vote. Now, my guess would be that he because of the nature of the repression in Iraq that he would have probably won anyway in some kind of an election, but, you know, the idea that you would tamper with it at all completely undermines the idea that your forces are the pro-democratic forces. No?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. And there&#8217;s no question, I mean it seems as though the numbers were fudged by more than a million votes, so it put them over the threshold of what the opposition alleges they got in their unofficial plebiscite. It was just to say, you know, “we have more than you do so then therefore we have a legitimate mandate.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, for me, it&#8217;s extremely disturbing, because Venezuela since 2004 has had one of the most bulletproof election systems. In this particular election, almost all of those were eliminated. So there is a lot of evidence to show that the vote, definitely the number could have been fudged. And that&#8217;s unfortunate because there&#8217;s a constituent assembly in place that is a supra-supreme power, that has now declared that they will be in power a minimum, or maybe a maximum, of two years, which is surprising because Hugo Chavez ran on a party platform in 1998 to rewrite the Constitution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He was elected by a majority based on that as being one of the primary actions he would take. Then it was put to a vote after he was elected, to whether or not people actually wanted to proceed. More than 70 percent of those participating said yes. Then they elected the members. Then it was done in this extremely open, transparent way. And it wasn&#8217;t all supreme, that it could be a legislator and an executor and an enforcer, which is what we&#8217;re seeing now. So that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a lot of concern coming from people like myself, you know, where I&#8217;m saying, wait a minute, what happened to sort of our democratic framework that has been so upheld throughout this time period, despite, you know, a lot of cracks in the system along the way. Now we&#8217;re seeing a major rupture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well and I don&#8217;t know anything about Maduro&#8217;s family members and their qualifications, but just the idea that you had his son and his wife now part of this constituent assembly, combined with the, what seems to be pretty clear case of manipulating the numbers, albeit, perhaps unnecessarily, as you say, the aesthetic there is really bad for Maduro.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Of course. The optics are terrible. But you have to understand that corruption and nepotism are parts of Venezuelan society. I mean it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s ironic, because when Hugo Chavez won in 1998, his two principal sort of promises in addition to the Constitution were eradicating poverty and corruption. You know, the governments that were in place before he was elected were extremely corrupt. I mean that&#8217;s why people were so disgusted with the sort of two-party system that was in place in Venezuela since the fall of the last dictatorship in 1958, and they wanted to break free with it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When I first went to Venezuela in 1993, the country was in a complete collapse. There was an economic crisis, the currency was devalued and the inflation was increasing, but I mean many of the things that are happening now, which is why it&#8217;s so ironic. And then there was a suspension of constitutional rights. There was a national curfew. There was a forced military draft. Poverty had grown to around 80 percent. You know there was an elite control over the country&#8217;s oil wealth and the oil industry despite the fact that it was nationalized in 1976.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So when people voted for Hugo Chavez and this idea of a Bolivarian revolution, they wanted to break free of a corrupt system. So, the fact that now it&#8217;s sort of coming full cycle and we&#8217;re seeing the nepotism reemerging, the corruption proliferating, the exclusionary tactics taking place, the sort of suppression of dissent, you know, the poverty increasing, the inflation, the economy falling again. I mean, when one looks at it and says, &#8220;Well is this just the destiny of a country that has the bittersweet curse of oil?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And I wanted to ask you about that. One of the critiques has been that there&#8217;s been this massive over-reliance on oil revenue and that that&#8217;s part of what has fueled the anti-democratic realities that we&#8217;re seeing unfold in parts of the situation in Venezuela.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. But I mean it&#8217;s not — again, it&#8217;s nothing new, it&#8217;s how the country has been functioning for decades. It&#8217;s just that before most of that oil wealth was going into the pockets of an elite. Maduro essentially has tried to continue, ineffectively, the social policies that made Chavez so popular.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know when oil was reaching $60, $70 a barrel, Venezuela was spending lavishly not just on social programs, but on infrastructure, on all kinds of you know international agreements and buying things. One of the visions that Chavez himself had was to invest those natural resources  and strategic resources to use those instead of just exporting them. To be able to have the technology inside the country, to use them to build up the infrastructure in other domestic industries to reduce dependency on oil. You know, something that never happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so the dependency continues. And certainly, I mean it&#8217;s a huge cause of the crisis the country is facing today is that over-dependency and reliance on oil. Not just on the part of the government, but also by the people, who have become dependent on it in terms of expecting their piece of it. The overall entitlement that that people feel when they live in a system like that where the state is all-encompassing and provides so many of their basic services.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It does seem that that there is a trend under Maduro that echoes some of what we&#8217;ve seen in other governments in the region where all of the crises and all of the problems are essentially blamed on the United States or U.S. intervention. Now, of course, you, you wrote an entire book detailing U.S. dirty tricks and intervention in Venezuela —“The Chavez Code” — where you examined all of this in detail. Clearly the United States is constantly interfering in the affairs of countries around the world, but certainly throughout Central and South America. But it seems that that becomes a little bit too convenient to just constantly say, &#8220;Oh, well this is because of the United States. This is because of U.S.-backed groups. This is all a U.S. created opposition.&#8221; Am I wrong? I mean it seems like that that is sort of you know answer number one from the pro-Maduro camp.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> One of the things that made Chavez so popular initially was when he engaged in a military rebellion or a coup against this corrupt president in 1992 and it failed. Hugo Chavez, this young lieutenant colonel, came out in front of the cameras and took responsibility for the failure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HC:\u003c/strong> [Translated from Spanish] Unfortunately, for now, the objectives that we put forth were not achieved in this capital city. What I’m saying is that we, here in Caracas, were unable to control the power —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> For Venezuelans it was like a shock and awe moment. I mean here we have someone in a position of leadership who&#8217;s actually saying: &#8220;I failed and I take responsibility. There will be more, to be continued, the story will be continued,&#8221; which it most certainly was. But that was that was sort of a change a shift that you know was very attractive to a lot of people in a country where so many had just you know blamed others for their mistakes or just turned their back on it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now we&#8217;re seeing that again, I mean that&#8217;s been one of my criticisms, is, yes, there&#8217;s no question, is the U.S. funding the opposition in Venezuela? Absolutely. They&#8217;ve been doing it for years. You know, I mean I&#8217;ve thoroughly documented it by using the Freedom of Information Act and uncovering the U.S.&#8217;s own documents where they show that they&#8217;re funding the opposition.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Are they backing and pushing for regime change? Totally. I mean Mike Pompeo said it the other day in a, you know a public forum.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mike Pompeo:\u003c/strong> Any time you have a country as large and with the economic capacity with a country like Venezuela, America has a, a deep interest in making sure that it is stable and as Democratic as possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> We heard it from Rex Tillerson the other day, the State Department, straight out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rex Tillerson:\u003c/strong> We are evaluating all of our policy options as to what can we do to create a change of conditions, where either Maduro decides he doesn&#8217;t have a future, and wants to leave of his own accord, or we can return the government processes back to their constitution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Are there mistakes and responsibilities on the part of the government? Absolutely. I mean there&#8217;s been widespread mismanagement. They&#8217;ve made horrific economic decisions in terms of the currency and skyrocketed the inflation in a parallel black market for the dollar. I mean, and then at the same time the contracts that the government has engaged him with companies to supply, you know, food products and all kinds of other consumer products to the countries, they&#8217;ve been rife with corruption. You know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s over $300 billion dollars that have been embezzled out of the country over probably the past like four or five years that have been unaccounted for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The government can&#8217;t just say, &#8220;Oh we have no role in this.&#8221; I mean it&#8217;s not always you know the boogeyman&#8217;s fault, but the U.S. certainly has a role, an open, notorious role in not only backing an anti-government, undemocratic, in many ways, opposition in Venezuela and promoting regime change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean and that&#8217;s the other factor in this, is that the government of course is in power, you know, the Maduro government. So they bear always a larger responsibility for what&#8217;s happening in the country than you know those outside of it. But there&#8217;s no question that the opposition represents, you know, sort of the old school wealthy elite that control the private enterprises that have, you know, run Venezuela for, for decades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But certainly you also have a significant swath of Venezuelan society that also is opposed to Maduro that is not on the U.S. payroll.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. I mean it would be outrageous to say that they&#8217;re all on a payroll, or they&#8217;re paid protesters. That reminds me of you know Donald Trump saying that about anyone who protests against him. It&#8217;s ridiculous. Chavez was in office from essentially 1999 until he passed away in early 2013 and now Maduro&#8217;s been in office ever since. So it&#8217;s a complete generation that has grown up only knowing this government. And so, of course, I mean, they blame this government for the problems that they are experiencing in the country. Rightfully so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They have no reference of how it was before. Things were repressive, when there was real persecution, when there was torture, you know, and when there was no distribution of the oil wealth and when the poverty rates were so high. That for many people today is an unknown past. They only care about what&#8217;s happening now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So there&#8217;s a percentage of the population that sticks by this government because they don&#8217;t want what they see as the old guard to get back into power, because they fear that things will return to how they were before. They fear that they&#8217;ll become invisible again, and marginalized, and excluded, and persecuted. And they&#8217;re probably right, in a lot of that. What they say essentially is, &#8220;Yeah, we know they&#8217;re corrupt, yeah we know things aren&#8217;t great, but the alternative is worse.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. And I most certainly agree with your history there about the outside forces that supported that coup and then what the coup masters wanted to do. And, on the one hand, you have certain people within Venezuela, and in the region, who believe that defending the Venezuelan state, even with its flaws, is necessary because it&#8217;s an anti-imperialist and popular government. And then you have other groups that are recognizing everything you&#8217;re saying about the nature of some of the opposition groups, but are calling Maduro&#8217;s government increasingly delegitimized and authoritarian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I wanted to ask you, given that you knew Hugo Chavez well, that you wrote this book exposing U.S. interference in Venezuela, based on the United States government&#8217;s own documents, do you believe that what Maduro and his allies are doing right now betrays the legacy of Hugo Chavez?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> I think in some ways it&#8217;s on that path, certainly. There certainly isn&#8217;t a conscientious effort to betray Chavez&#8217;s legacy, but one of my main issues —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think it&#8217;s a pretty conscientious effort when you cook the books on a referendum.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Well, right, that type of, that type of behavior to me is completely unacceptable and obviously betrays that legacy and not just the legacy of Chavez, but of the whole Venezuelan democratic structure that&#8217;s been reinforced, you know, one was hoping, in this sort of more participatory democracy, over the past, or at least up until about 2012, before things started to completely fall apart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We can criticize the actions of the Maduro government and we can say some of them are betraying Chavez&#8217;s legacy, but they&#8217;re not the only ones who matter here. And we can also come out against any kind of U.S. intervention or efforts to impose regime change, as would be the same in any country around the world, you know, violating the sovereignty of another nation is unacceptable. But, at the same time, there still are millions of people in grassroots movements who are fighting for their democracy, and they have their issues as well with the people who are in power, but they&#8217;re not willing to let go and give up and cede their space to those on the far right-wing who would take power were this present government to lose power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean Venezuela doesn&#8217;t have any middle ground at this time. And that&#8217;s why I think there&#8217;s a lot on the people on the outside, on the left, who are saying let&#8217;s just criticize, and speak up against foreign intervention in Venezuela, and say nothing about Maduro. There are those who are saying, &#8220;No, no, we need to talk about the increasing authoritarian characteristics of this government. The betrayal maybe of aspects of Chavez&#8217;s legacy and all that was achieved under a Bolivarian Revolution that we&#8217;re now seeing come unraveled.&#8221; And you know there are those saying, &#8220;No, we need to stick by Maduro and just back him and keep our mouths shut.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of that debate needs to be had. At the same time, you have to look at, what is the role of people who are not directly involved in that movement, and which are the voices and the people who really matter who are in that movement. Is it Maduro himself and the people right around him in the structure of power at the top? Or is it the grassroots, the social movements, the workers, the community organizers, the people who are actually the ones trying, struggling, to hold on to anything that&#8217;s left of this movement that they have been building and empowering themselves with now over the past, you know, fifteen years or so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We hear from the opposition and the U.S. media all the time, we hear from all the critics, but we never hear from people. I&#8217;m not saying people who come out and say, &#8220;Oh, I love Maduro, I support Maduro.&#8221; But people in communities: poorer people and the working class. I mean that&#8217;s the majority of people really who comprise the Chavez movement in Venezuela. It&#8217;s this elite power structure that&#8217;s corrupted at the top.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now with the exception of designating Maduro, the Trump Administration seems to be essentially continuing, albeit with its own sort of spin, the basic U.S. policy toward Venezuela, at least publicly. What does this mean that Maduro has been designated and that assets have been frozen?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Well it doesn&#8217;t mean much inside Venezuela. In fact, it&#8217;s seen as a badge of honor. Every time someone has been singled out by the U.S. government in recent years and given one of these sanctions, they have been awarded by Maduro himself, recently, this sword of Bolivar, which is a replica of Simon Bolivar&#8217;s sword, the founding father of Venezuela. It seems to kind of backfire because it really rallies the people and the troops around the government in the face of an external threat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Western world can come out against Venezuela. First of all, they&#8217;re not cutting off the oil supply. Were they to do that, they would harm more U.S. interests probably than Venezuela, practically, since it&#8217;s 30 percent of the oil supply to the United States and they have six refineries here in the United States. And Venezuela owns the Citgo gas chain, which has, you know thousands of gas stations throughout the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But as long as Venezuela maintains their commercial ties and their strategic alliance with countries like Russia and China they&#8217;re not going to back down in the face of an external threat. They&#8217;re just going to get stronger in terms of doubling down. And I think that&#8217;s something that it seems that to me that the U.S. government or the those who have the ear of whoever&#8217;s conducting that particular foreign policy fail to understand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and if you know Venezuela was producing vegetable oil instead of black gold, I think we&#8217;d see a very different situation. What do you think would be the most effective path forward given now that the United States has publicly taken this very hostile position toward Maduro, and that you have an increasing chorus of voices including people that are certainly not on the U.S. payroll, basically saying, &#8220;Look, Maduro, you&#8217;re tilting toward authoritarianism here.&#8221; What should happen going forward in order to resolve this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Holding elections. The problem now is that because of the fact that the electoral system may have been compromised, most likely was, in this past election, and because of the fact that now there&#8217;s a supra-government body in place that could decide whether or not elections take place  —  or, even, if those elections take place, they&#8217;ll still have power above whoever wins office. So, you know, it seems as though there needs to be some negotiating going on in terms of, you know, setting clear lines and a structure for how things are going to evolve. There has to be an electoral way out. There cannot be a regime change, not a coup, not any kind of anarchical, violent protests in the streets to push the country further to a civil war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Venezuela is a country with a lot of guns and you know it&#8217;s grown increasingly violent over the years. People have become more and more sort of radicalized in their positions, and I think all efforts, internationally, as well as those internally should be looking for a negotiated way out that would have to include some kind of truth and justice commission, amnesty for those who have been involved in all the events and developments over the past couple years, because you can&#8217;t find a way out of the situation if people feel as though they&#8217;re going to be persecuted once they&#8217;re out of power.  Despite, you know, on both sides there have been crimes. And it&#8217;s just an unfortunate reality. So that way at least, you know, there will be a feeling that people can move on and pass this without persecution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right. Eva Golinger, we&#8217;re going to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Eva Golinger is an attorney and author of several books. Among them, &#8220;The Chavez Code.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> To close today&#8217;s show, our producer, Jack D&#8217;Isidoro, spoke to Venezuelan singer and songwriter Claudia Lizardo of the band La Pequeña Revancha.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Claudia Lizardo:\u003c/strong> Hello, I&#8217;m Claudia Lizardo. I&#8217;m 29 years old. I live in Caracas, Venezuela. I&#8217;m a musician and a copywriter, and I have a band that&#8217;s named La Pequeña Revancha — &#8220;the little revenge.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Apache” by La Pequeña Revancha]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CL:\u003c/strong> The crisis in the music scene has been very, very harsh because a lot of people have immigrated, so that impacts directly on any plans you can have to develop a band and to have a stable band. I dream that my country goes out of this in a peaceful way, and through elections and through the vote which is, I think the biggest tool and the most powerful tool we democrats have — democrats, I mean people that believe in democracy. So that would be the ideal scenario for me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The thing is, this country has a history of military action. So I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen. I mean there are a lot of people that think that the way out of this is the most violent, aggressive way. I&#8217;m not a politician, I&#8217;m not an expert but I do wish that we go out — that we can come out of this peacefully because there have been a lot of people that have died and a lot of people incarcerated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s a lot of fear on the streets. I have a lot of fear. I&#8217;m scared, I&#8217;m scared to the core, you know, I&#8217;m not going to lie to you. I&#8217;m the daughter of a very important musician in Venezuela. My father, he had a legendary band, a rock-and-roll band called “La Misma Gente,” which translates to &#8220;the same people.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“La Misma Gente” musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The day that Chavez passed away, that day, I have like a very blurry memory of it, because that same day my father was having a massive stroke. It was very interesting, because my father just stepped, kind of stepped out of the music scene and I finally got the chance to do my thing. You know? And I kind of inherited all of this, all of it all of his guitars, et cetera.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it was kind of a — yeah it was interesting, that like a switch happened there and this is a song that I wrote about my father. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;Yo Era El Sol,&#8221; Yo era el sol means &#8220;I was the son.&#8221; As I was telling you, my father suffered a severe stroke, a massive stroke back in 2013, and he was, as I was telling you, a very a legendary musician. He was a very charismatic musician and he was a songwriter and he&#8217;s, and he talked a lot and he was very outgoing. And it was very ironic and very sad because the stroke — he didn&#8217;t die, he’s very good — the thing the thing is that the stroke eliminated his speech and his and his ability to play his guitar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it&#8217;s very ironic that life takes away when you need to identify yourself. People that don&#8217;t know the story often tell me that the song is about the country because it&#8217;s a song about longing and about the nostalgia for something that was — that&#8217;s not there anymore. So that — that happens with Venezuela. We don&#8217;t recognize ourselves in the mirror anymore. And there&#8217;s a lot of melancholy and nostalgia about what we were. So that’s &#8220;Yo Era El Sol&#8221; and I hope you like it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Yo Era El Sol&#8221; by La Pequeña Revancha]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That is &#8220;Yo Era El Sol&#8221; by Claudia Lizardo, a musical artist from Caracas, Venezuela.

But he probably wasn’t so hot on this year’s Miss Texas who called him out during the Miss America competition for his horrid response to the neo-Nazi violence against protesters. This week on Intercepted, we talk Trump, Confederate monuments, and racism with activist and commentator Shaun King. He also lays out his argument for boycotting the NFL in response to the blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick after his very public protests on and off the field. We also get analysis from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on the massive data breach at the credit reporting agency Equifax, as well as his current assessment of the evidence of Russian interference in the U.S. election. And we talk about Chicago housing projects and hear music from alt-rap artist Open Mike Eagle.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Jill Colucci &#8220;The Funny Things You Do&#8221;]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>You&#8217;re the red, white and blue\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>The funny things you do\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>America, America this is you\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J.

Hurricanes, climate disasters, climate change deniers, Trump tweeting about the hurricanes like they&#8217;re a sign of his greatness because of how massive they are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> They were just happy. We saw a lot of happiness. It&#8217;s been really nice, it&#8217;s been a wonderful thing. As Trump — as tough as it was, it&#8217;s been a wonderful thing, I think even for the country to watch, and the world to the watch. It&#8217;s been beautiful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Neo-Nazis killing people in broad daylight. Neo-Nazis shooting at people in broad daylight. Confederate statues coming down. Overt racists rising up to defend them. In some cases, comparing them to 9/11 memorials.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ryan Zinke:\u003c/strong> And also talking about the change that 9/11 brought to all Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Brian Kilmeade:\u003c/strong> Do you worry 100 years from now someone&#8217;s going to try to take that memorial down like they&#8217;re trying to remake our memorials today?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The cruel war against undocumented immigrants and documented immigrants, and the very real threat to deport more than 700,000 people who were promised that they could stay in this country. The escalation of the failed war in Afghanistan. The continued U.S. sponsored slaughter in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We live in a time where we have a dangerous, unhinged narcissist in the White House, and we face the most grave risk of the use of nuclear weapons in recent world history. On any given day, it&#8217;s difficult to decide who actually is more nuts: Kim Jong Un or Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yet major publications, including the New York Times, chose to run stories recently emphasizing that Donald Trump is an independent, that he&#8217;s willing to defy the Republican Party to chart his own course. That&#8217;s utter bullshit. Donald Trump represents the most dramatic, extraverted version of a sizable portion of the Republican Party. He says things they believe and that they want legislated or that they want decreed by fiat, but that they don&#8217;t want to be caught saying openly. Or, at least not as plainly as Trump says them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump has radical, ideological zealots running major U.S. agencies. People like Mike Pompeo at the CIA, Betsy DeVos at the department of education, Mike Pence as his vice president. Trump has handed the state department over to Rex Tillerson and Exxon Mobil. And for all the talk of James Mattis being one of the adults in the room, his record in the U.S. military and his role in massacres overseas, that should have disqualified him from any higher office. But that would have required backbone or actual opposition to Mattis&#8217;s past actions from the Democrats, and there simply was none to be found.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, no — Trump is not an independent. He&#8217;s a vehicle, a sort of Trojan horse for some of the most extreme right-wing radicals and radical ideas to ascend to the highest levels of power in this country. And Trump has emboldened racists and white supremacists he has welcomed them to his staff in the White House, he&#8217;s pushed them out on national television to speak for him, he named one as his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The violence we&#8217;re seeing from these neo-Nazis does not exist in a vacuum. They&#8217;re so-called defense of Confederate monuments — which, by the way, were built specifically to terrorize or harass black people well after the Civil War was over — that doesn&#8217;t exist in a vacuum, these actions are being encouraged and empowered because of how Trump speaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what is amazing, and I don&#8217;t know how many of you watched the Miss America pageant last week, I don&#8217;t normally watch the Miss America pageant — I actually didn&#8217;t watch it, but I did watch clips. And as all of us know Donald Trump normally loves these pageants — he gets to harass young women and fantasize about them. And Trump loves to talk about how much he loves Texas and vice versa. Well those two things came together at this year&#8217;s Miss America Pageant. Check out what happened when Miss Texas was interviewed as part of the contest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jess Cagle:\u003c/strong> Last month, a demonstration of Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the K.K.K. in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent and a counter protester was killed. The president said there was shared blame with &#8220;very fine people on both sides.&#8221; Were there? Tell me yes, or no, and explain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Miss Texas, Margana Wood:\u003c/strong> I think that the white supremacist issue, it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack. And I think that President Donald Trump should have made a statement earlier addressing the fact and making sure all Americans feel safe in this country. That is number one issue right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s amazing that Miss Texas was able to make a point that Trump and his supporters pretend that they don&#8217;t get, they have no understanding of where this is coming from. But maybe that&#8217;s a good indication of where we are right now in this country. I&#8217;ll also add that another Miss America contestant, Miss Missouri, addressed another major issue in the news in a much smarter and more nuanced way than most of the pundits you&#8217;ll see on MSNBC and that was on the issue of Trump and Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jordin Sparks:\u003c/strong> There are multiple investigations into whether Trump&#8217;s campaign colluded with Russia on the election. Well, did they? You&#8217;re the jury: guilty or innocent, and please explain your verdict.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Miss Missouri, Jennifer Davis: \u003c/strong>Right now, I&#8217;d have to say innocent because not enough information has been revealed. We are still investigating this and I think we should investigate it to its fullest extent. And if we do find the evidence that they have had collusion with Russia, then they should, the justice system should do their due diligence and they should be punished accordingly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was Miss Missouri, Jennifer Davis. Well, this week I had a chance to check in with N.S.A. whistleblower, Edward Snowden. He was not in the Miss America Pageant, he continues to live in exile in Moscow, Russia. I did a public interview with him at the Free Library of Philadelphia and I asked him about this massive data breach at the credit monitoring firm Equifax where upwards of $150 million people&#8217;s personal data was exposed. And I also asked him for his current take on the investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> From all of the publicly available information that you&#8217;ve seen, and I know you monitor these issues extremely closely, are you convinced that there was a campaign directed from the highest levels of power in Moscow to seek to influence the outcome of the U.S. election? And you&#8217;re speaking to us of course from Moscow right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES:\u003c/strong> Right, right, right. If the feed gets cut short, you guys know why. (laughter) You know this is one of those things where it&#8217;s frustrating because there&#8217;s so much smoke, and nobody&#8217;s willing to point to fire. And I come from the NSA, right? My last position, I was working counter-cyber, finding exactly the kind of hackers that are being sort of alleged in this current moment, but for China rather than for Russia. And I got to tell you, it wasn&#8217;t real hard to find these guys.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So we had this report that came from the DNI and basically three agencies: I think it was the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA. And they said in their finding that they had you know confidence that that was the assessment, but there were some really weird things this is led to this sort of ongoing drama that everybody&#8217;s focused on and it&#8217;s consuming nation with kind of a passion where we can focus on anything else. Because we&#8217;re elevating Russia to a position where they can sort of control our political outcomes. And I think that&#8217;s actually giving Russia too much credit. I don&#8217;t think Russia is that strong, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But when we look at this report, and we think about, obviously, Russia would have interest, any country would have interest in changing electoral outcomes in other countries, I mean we do it, why wouldn&#8217;t the Russians. But the main thing here is the FBI and the CIA both said we have high confidence in this assessment, basically the Russians did, and the NSA, who is best positioned to actually make this judgment, so they had medium confidence in this assessment. But why discrepancy there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the only reason that I can think about, and again I don&#8217;t know this. This the problem when we speak about these things we need evidence. You can track sort of these, let&#8217;s call them hacking attempts, from where they’re launched, even if the hackers are trying to hide their footsteps, when you have the powers of the NSA —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re going out there, Ed. The feed actually has become choppy now that you&#8217;re getting into the details. [Audience laughs] As you were, Ed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES:\u003c/strong> To simplify things, and to sort of tie up the point here, when they were looking at the hacking into the DNC&#8217;s servers. This is a high value target. Whether we&#8217;re talking about the United States, whether we&#8217;re talking China, whether we&#8217;re talking Russia, everybody is targeting these institutions, if they have the resources, if they have the people, that&#8217;s their job.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And former director of the NSA and CIA. Michael Hayden says this — he&#8217;s actually described this as honorable espionage, which I think is a bit much, but that&#8217;s his perspective, right? This is what intelligence agencies do. And the problem with this is so the DNC didn&#8217;t actually provide their service to the FBI. They contracted this third party company that&#8217;s basically paid to provide an explanation that goes, look this matches these attack indicators, right? Fair enough. We&#8217;ve seen these before. They&#8217;re attributed to the Russians, we think Russian —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But that&#8217;s all that they provide. The reality here is if the NSA didn&#8217;t have the same level of confidence, it&#8217;s very likely it&#8217;s because there are more people on the system, right? There could be multiple actors there. We can have the French, we can have the Chinese, we can have the Israelis, we can have the Germans all on the same system. And this happens all of the time, it happens so frequently that in NSA we have an actual term of art for this. Instead of hacking somebody, we&#8217;ll just watch what the hackers who already hacked them are taking, and then we just save a copy of that. It is called fourth-party collection.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And because there was so much traffic on this, they couldn’t really de-conflict it. But this raises the big question of, &#8220;Ok, well if the Russians didn&#8217;t do it, who did it, right?&#8221; And I think this is where it gets dicey— and where I start to think alright is probably Russians —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hold on a bit, Ed. You said the word ‘Russia’ again, and it started to go choppy. [Audience laughs] Either that or someone — someone&#8217;s downloading porn here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES:\u003c/strong> Right. Right. Right. So we&#8217;ll tie this off then, because it’s going on for a while. There is this allegation, right, that Vladimir Putin and Hillary Clinton basically hate each other, like they&#8217;re mortal enemies, right? And he wouldn&#8217;t want to see this. So when you start seeing a qui bono, you know maybe it&#8217;s possible. But here&#8217;s the central problem with everything we&#8217;ve discussed right now: it&#8217;s entirely speculation. Absolutely none of it is reliable. And previously when the United States government has seen hacking efforts that they considered threats to national security, they released evidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is what&#8217;s missing. The NSA is spying on everyone, everywhere, all of the time. That&#8217;s how mass surveillance works. So why is it that we aren&#8217;t getting evidence about what is arguably the most important public policy question, when it comes to sort of foreign intelligence efforts in recent history?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ed, we only have a few moments left and I think I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t ask you about this Equifax breach, but it&#8217;s also emblematic of the powder keg that is all of this private data about us that is held by so many private corporations. And what&#8217;s particularly, you know, insane about the Equifax situation is that these are the people that can like prevent you from ever buying a house because you didn&#8217;t pay your credit card bill once, and it&#8217;s like they can&#8217;t even fucking keep our Social Security numbers safe. You know it&#8217;s like, who are they to tell anyone that they shouldn&#8217;t be eligible for a car loan ever again?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it, but it reveals something I think, you know, that I think should be of deep concern to all of us. So many people have willingly given enormous quantities of private personal information to a variety of corporations and government entities, if you look at what&#8217;s happening with our healthcare system in the digitization of our medical records. But also unwittingly huge corporations have developed enormous dossiers on all of us that are lying there waiting to be exploited someday, or a breach happens and it ends up out in the open.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But in this whole landscape and the data breaches, what is your assessment of that and what can people do, what should people do to try to confront what is this unprecedented amassing of information about all of us and our private lives?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ES:\u003c/strong> Well first. there&#8217;s two parts to this question. there&#8217;s the specific case and there&#8217;s the general case. When we talk about Equifax, right, the last count that I saw was the records of 143 million Americans were lost. There&#8217;s no way that this doesn&#8217;t happen without negligence, because the volume of data that has been moved from a system that should not be pushing that much data, right, is very trivially detectable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Imagine you have a hose, leading out of your house, right? And somebody can have a hose turned on and water flows out of the house, but it takes a long time right to create thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of water charges. Now imagine, somebody snuck in your house when you were, you were sleeping and they increased the water pressure on that system so that you have a stream of water shooting out of that hose that&#8217;s so powerful, it actually rips your house off the foundations, pushes it down the block. And you just go out of your house in the morning and drive to work, don&#8217;t notice it, you don&#8217;t tell anybody about it, you just go and you drive back at the end of the day and go, &#8220;My house isn&#8217;t there!&#8221; [Audience laughs.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s what happened, right? It is ridiculous that this could occur at a company that is so powerful, so influential, so rich. It&#8217;s naked negligence. But then there&#8217;s the larger general case here. We are living through the greatest crisis in computer security that we have ever seen. This is the atomic moment for computer science as we had for nuclear physics in the last century, the last generation where people who had developed a science, a technology for the empowerment of humanity found only a few short years later, people began mastering this technology to use it to subjugate people, rather than to lift them up, to press them down. Right? And you have to care about this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yes, we should be angry with the hackers, right? But we should think about how the ecosystem got to this point. We should think about the fact that there are liability laws for every other sector of the American economy. If you build and sell a car, that car has to meet some minimum safety standards. If you develop and sell a new medicine, it has to meet certain minimum safety standards. If you sell a burrito on the street, it&#8217;s got to meet minimum safety standards. But if you create a credit monitoring system that impacts the lives of basically everyone with a credit card in the United States, there are no minimum safety standards that they&#8217;re having to deal with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this goes double for the people who actually write software in the first place. Now I don&#8217;t know where to set the law. I don&#8217;t know how to change these things. I&#8217;m not going to pretend to be the guy with the magic wand in the policy prescription here. But I think we can all recognize that if industry will not regulate itself here, someone else is going to have to do it for them. [Audience claps.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. I talked to him on Monday in an interview that I did at the Free Library of Philadelphia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Coming up on the show we&#8217;re going to talk to activist and columnist Shaun King about the boycott that he&#8217;s leading against the NFL, as well as his crusade to catch the neo-Nazis, who gang beat an African-American man in the parking garage of the Charlottesville police station. We will also hear from the art-rap artist Open Mike Eagle. This is Intercepted. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hey everyone. This is the time of the show where there would normally be an ad for some mattress or mail order food or a razor that your face just has to feel. Well, not anymore. On the show, Intercepted is going ad-free. Instead, we&#8217;re going to ask our listeners to help support this show and keep it available to everyone. We&#8217;re going to be launching a community fundraising effort soon and we hope that you&#8217;ll consider chipping in if you&#8217;re able to. We&#8217;re also going to announce some cool thank you gifts for our supporters. Oh, and we just launched a new Facebook group for listeners who still use Facebook. It&#8217;s simply called Intercepted Listeners. Ok, now I&#8217;m gonna shut up. Back to the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok. We are back here on Intercepted, and the NFL season is now underway. There&#8217;s a lot of discussion about the political stance that a handful of athletes have begun taking, namely protesting during the national anthem. Some players have raised a black gloved fist. Others have sat or knelt during the national anthem, and several of the players who have chosen to protest have said that they&#8217;re doing it in response to racism and police brutality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the players engaging in protest is the Seattle Seahawks star defensive back Michael Bennett. He explained his motivation last month on CNN.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Michael Bennett:\u003c/strong> I won&#8217;t stand until everything&#8217;s equal. I won&#8217;t stand until everybody has justice. I won&#8217;t stand until everybody has freedom. The things that America has built on, I think protesting the national anthem begins a conversation about the truth of America. I&#8217;m not protecting the flag. I&#8217;m actually trying to honor what we&#8217;re supposed to be honoring: the freedom of America, the equality of America, the justice for all, and the liberty. Those are things that I&#8217;m trying to remind people that we all fought for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Just days after that interview, Michael Bennet was attending a boxing match in Las Vegas. And after the match there was an incident in a casino where Las Vegas police responded to what they say they thought was a shooting incident. And in their response, they went after Michael Bennett. They pointed a gun at him. They ordered him to the ground. And they handcuffed him as he protested that he had done nothing wrong. And parts of this were caught on video tape.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After the incident, Bennett released a statement saying that an officer told him that if he moved, the officer would, &#8220;blow my fucking head off.&#8221; Bennett said that the excessive use of force was unbearable and he wrote in a statement that he released, &#8220;I felt helpless as I lay there on the ground, handcuffed, facing the real-life threat of being killed. All I could think of was: I&#8217;m going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin color is somehow a threat.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After Bennett went public with this story, the Las Vegas police attempted to get the NFL to punish Bennett, saying that he had unfairly accused them of racism. The league said it wasn&#8217;t going to do that. Bennett&#8217;s teammate, NFL star Richard Sherman, spoke to reporters about the incident.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Sherman:\u003c/strong> Mike is literally, you know, sitting, taking a stand, protesting, and doing everything he can to combat the exact thing that he experienced. And people are so worried about him sitting down during the national anthem that they that completely missed that message a lot of times. They want to be more angry at the action than the message, and that&#8217;s an important part in part of the world we live in nowadays. I wish that people would take it for what it is and make a difference and go out there and try to combat against racism, fascism, unnecessary violence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The current media discussion of athletes daring to engage in protest seems to completely ignore several crucial points. First, NFL games are already dripping with politics and militarism, and they encourage a worship of the military and weapons of war as the one true form of patriotism. Second, they ignore the historical roots of athletes protesting. The black fist raised at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Muhammad Ali&#8217;s resistance to the war in Vietnam, and on, and on. And third, these commentaries act as though the First Amendment has some secret clause that says athletes cannot engage in nonviolent protest. Like, like they&#8217;re supposed to surrender their humanity or their principles when they put on their helmet and uniform.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This debate isn&#8217;t new but it&#8217;s flared up over the past year because of an action that was taken last year by then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He refused to stand for the national anthem and then had the audacity to speak out about racism and other systemic injustices when asked why he did it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Here&#8217;s Colin Kaepernick explaining his motives last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Colin Kaepernick:\u003c/strong> Yes, I&#8217;ll continue to sit. I&#8217;m going to continue to stand with the people that have been oppressed. To me this is something that has to change and when there&#8217;s significant change and I feel like that flag represents who is supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way they&#8217;re supposed to, I&#8217;ll stand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Kaepernick’s action sparked reaction from pundits, celebrities, President Obama, and of course Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> But there was an article today that was reported that NFL owners don&#8217;t want to pick him up, because they don&#8217;t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump. Do you believe that? I said if I remember that one, I&#8217;m going to report it to the people of Kentucky, because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump was also joined by his ally and apparently rising GOP political star Kid Rock, in attacking Kaepernick at a concert.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kid Rock:\u003c/strong> Man, fuck Colin Kaepernick!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Colin Kaepernick was a highly ranked quarterback in the NFL, yet he no longer has a team. In fact, he wasn&#8217;t even invited to training camp. His critics say it&#8217;s because he had a bad season last year, which is debatable: the 49ers were terrible, but Kaepernick&#8217;s stats were pretty solid. But others say it&#8217;s because he is a liability because of his politics. Here&#8217;s an example of how all of this was discussed recently on Fox News, on its show The Five.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jesse Waters:\u003c/strong> The guy&#8217;s a loser on the field, he&#8217;s a loser off the field, bottom line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Juan Williams:\u003c/strong> How are you going to call him a loser off the field?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kimberly Guilfoyle:\u003c/strong> I know, it&#8217;s John Madden over here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jesse Waters:\u003c/strong> Everybody hates him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Greg Gutfeld:\u003c/strong> I feel like this is another arena where identity politics invades and divides, because it creates a prism that only allows for one perspective. It&#8217;s got to be racist, if they do this, you&#8217;ve got to you have to hate this person because of their skin color, that&#8217;s what identity politics does.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Supporters of Kaepernick, including the NAACP, have alleged that the reason the Colin Kaepernick is not currently on an NFL team&#8217;s roster is because of racism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This past weekend, activist and columnist Shaun King issued a public call for a boycott of the NFL, and he spent NFL Sunday hanging out with Colin Kaepernick. Shaun King joins me now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Shaun, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Shaun King:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m glad to be here, man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain why you&#8217;re calling for a boycott of the NFL.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Well I decided several months ago that I wasn&#8217;t going to watch any of the games, in huge part because I&#8217;ve become friends with Colin. and it was just painful personally for me to see what I thought was a grave injustice happening to him. It was really like a friend seeing a friend lose, not just his job, but his dream. This is something he&#8217;s fought for his whole life, he&#8217;s in the prime of his career, he&#8217;s 29 years old. And he took this peaceful stand against injustice, which I encouraged him to take, not thinking that he would be blacklisted from the league. Like I thought it might change his reputation. I thought he might get a cold shoulder.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But my thought was he&#8217;s too big to fail in a sense. Surely they won&#8217;t do this to Colin. Quarterback is the most in-demand position. He&#8217;s solid. He&#8217;s smart. He has great character. And even though I knew there was a possibility that he might struggle to find a job, I didn&#8217;t think it would come to this. And when I saw over and over again teams kind of strangely contorting themselves to justify not giving him a job even though they desperately needed a quarterback, I made a personal decision in June, like, “Ok, I can&#8217;t watch this. This is, I don&#8217;t support how they&#8217;ve done it. I don&#8217;t support how they&#8217;re treating him.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I had other issues with the league, be it CTE, or how they were would constantly give other guys a pass for genuinely horrendous behaviors. And so I made the decision but I wasn&#8217;t really ready to ask other people to follow me. And there was a part of me that thought from June until September that, that he would get a job. And I think it&#8217;s the foolish optimist in me that thought people would be able to look past his protest and the few things that he said to the media, and look at their need as a team. Be it the Jets, or twenty different teams in a league that at least need a strong backup quarterback.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Here we are in September and he didn&#8217;t have a position and it looked like he&#8217;s not going to get one. And I literally made the decision at the last minute, just maybe three or four days ago, that I wanted to encourage people to take this stand with me. And while there are many reasons, for me it&#8217;s very personal. And it&#8217;s that we live in a time where a man very quietly, peacefully, and intelligently just stated his problems with police brutality and injustice in America, and had his career taken from him because of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now for people that didn&#8217;t follow this closely, explain how this started with Colin Kaepernick. What action he took, why he took it, and then what he&#8217;s done since then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Colin said he&#8217;s always been bothered by police brutality, but he never understood it as the systemic problem that it was. And he&#8217;s a young guy, he was 21 when he came into the league, and he literally started auditing a few classes at Berkeley, and from those classes began understanding what systemic racism was. Began understanding the systems behind mass incarceration or white supremacy or police brutality. And he was doing this with very few people, including myself, not knowing. I had no idea he was auditing classes. He was kind of undergoing a personal metamorphosis, and he was doing it while he was recovering from the surgeries that he had had.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And during last summer he saw the deaths of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and they just affected him personally. And really without talking to anybody, he decided at a pre-season game that he wasn&#8217;t going to stand up for the national anthem. And so Colin and I had been talking for couple of months at that point, and I think it really was a spur of the moment, gut decision where he heard the anthem and just decided like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to stand up for that. I don&#8217;t feel like it. I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221; And when they noticed, a local reporter asked him about it at the end of the game, and that he hadn&#8217;t prepared any bullets and he just said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CK:\u003c/strong> I mean, ultimately it&#8217;s to bring awareness and make people, you know, realize what&#8217;s really going on in this country. There are a lot of things that are going on that are unjust, people aren&#8217;t being held accountable for. And that&#8217;s something that needs to change, that&#8217;s something that you know this country stands for freedom, liberty, justice for all. And it&#8217;s not happening for all right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> And, you know that he was doing this to be in solidarity with victims of police brutality. And I was working with those families: Philando Castile&#8217;s family, Alton Sterling&#8217;s family. And they were deeply moved by it. And I think when he learned that these families who rarely get anything that resembles justice, when he learned that they were touched by his demonstration, I think he decided to stick with it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it became a national conversation where after games there be dozens of reporters there just to ask him what he was thinking. And people were taken aback because what they found was a bright, brilliant young man who had ample reason to do what he was doing and could explain it very articulately. And I think people thought maybe there was no depth there, like a stereotype of an athlete.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I, I had the thought man that he was so careful and methodical about how he handled this that — not that the country would change, but I had never thought he would be, in essence, banned from the league. And that&#8217;s what we have here, a guy who, in the prime of his physical career, was not even brought in for a serious look.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And I want to talk about that, because the flip side of this argument, I don&#8217;t mean to say that there&#8217;s only two ways of looking at this, but you have NFL commentators and others who are saying, &#8220;Look at the stats that he put up last year, he had a terrible season.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> He didn&#8217;t, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m saying, but this is what is said. That he clearly had peaked, and sort of was on his way down. What&#8217;s interesting is that you have, I&#8217;m from Wisconsin, so I&#8217;m biased, the best quarterback in the country, Aaron Rodgers, who is not known for being a political guy, actually very recently came out and said, &#8220;No, I think that Colin Kaepernick should be on a team, and that this is political. This is not about his skills.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Yeah, when I saw Aaron say this, like he&#8217;s not a guy that takes hard stands on political issues. And so when he said something I was very curious as to what he was going to say. And he said emphatically, without hesitation, like, “no this is not a football decision, that had he not taken the stand that he that he took, he would be on the team right now. He would be the quarterback of the 49ers, and so he works out six days a week and has been. He&#8217;s in incredible shape. He&#8217;s, he could start for a team right away. Yet, here we are. He has not even been given a backup position.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so there have been a lot of lies about him, like people said that he wouldn&#8217;t take a backup position. That&#8217;s a lie. He would. People said he also would not even accept a smaller contract. That&#8217;s a lie. He also hasn&#8217;t even been offered any contracts. And —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And you, and you have guys who have criminal convictions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who have done time in prison, I mean Michael Vick and the whole, you know, dog torturing thing, and he you know he comes back into the league and there is there was also a lot of racism in the way that Michael Vick was covered. But, but these guys, and some of them are white players who have all sorts of trouble with the law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And we&#8217;re not talking about a guy who broke the law here, we&#8217;re talking about a guy who nonviolently took a political position.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Well, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s disturbing man, is he is the stereotype of what black men are told they have to be to be successful. Like he, he is quiet. He literally stays in at night, he doesn&#8217;t party or go to the clubs, he&#8217;s never been in legal trouble a day in his life. He&#8217;s a college graduate, a bright guy, he&#8217;s in a committed relationship with an upstanding woman. I mean I hate to even list these things, but he is everything young black men are told they will need to be to rise up any type of corporate ladder. And—\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, except —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Except black.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> But here&#8217;s the thing: other black men in the league, as you noted, have done horrific things. And I think it gets to the fact that the decision is actually extremely political. At least seven team owners in the NFL have given a million dollars or more to Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign. People can universally agree that NFL ownership is the most conservative ownership group of any sports league in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> In the audience we have somebody that&#8217;s under no pressure whatsoever because he&#8217;s got a great quarterback named Tom Brady, and a great coach, and a great coach named Belichick. Bob Kraft. So good luck, Bob.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> And I think what they&#8217;re trying to do is to make an example of Colin. And I think it&#8217;s working. Last year on any given day, you would see dozens, as many as 50 people demonstrate. And now yesterday I think there were five. Now that the season has started, that number may even go down to four, three. And I think guys are spooked. Guys have told me, particularly guys on rookie contracts, guys that don&#8217;t have Colin&#8217;s name or reputation have told me, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this man. If they do to me what they did to him, I haven&#8217;t made the money he&#8217;s made and I have no backup plan.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it effectively did what I believe those owners wanted to do. It spooked the majority of guys, so basically the only guys who are doing it at this point are guys who are firm in their position. But all the other guys who are doing it, they&#8217;ve been spooked and they&#8217;re backing down. I think that that was what they wanted, was to freak enough guys out that they&#8217;ll back down. The only people that are left are kind of revolutionary guys, guys who, you know, are radicals at heart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, it&#8217;s also interesting, this kind of mealy mouth line, &#8220;Well, these guys shouldn&#8217;t be political.&#8221; The entire framing of the NFL for many years has been overtly political in celebration of the U.S. war machine. You have the jets that are flying overhead, Ted Cruz was at a game this weekend celebrating with this American bald eagle that went over a huge American flag tarp —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> And it was like a bald eagle on steroids, it was the largest bald — when I first saw it I was like, &#8220;Is that real!” And he was but he was bragging because the flag took up the entire field from corner to corner. I think they literally found the world&#8217;s largest bald eagle, and the world&#8217;s largest flag. And there&#8217;s money being exchanged here between the military and the NFL. They actually are paying for a lot of these demonstrations that people didn&#8217;t even understand that marketing dollars are at play.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Also, and it&#8217;s not like, &#8220;Oh look, we&#8217;re all coming together to celebrate our country.&#8221; It is overtly about celebrating the part of our country that wages wars.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That increasingly a majority of people are against. So the politics is already drilled. into the whole apparatus. It would be one thing if we had some massive celebration of the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment, you know, as part of the patriotism but it&#8217;s just one part of America that&#8217;s being honored and that is the militaristic component of this country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Yeah, I agree, and in spite of that people aren&#8217;t looking at the nuanced nature of really what&#8217;s at play here. Even the fact that they brought back Hank Williams, Jr., who for the first time in almost six years will be doing his Monday Night Football anthem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Hank Williams Jr. “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Well it&#8217;s Monday Night and we&#8217;re ready to strike\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Our special forces are in full flight\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>We&#8217;re coming by air and on the ground\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Monday night football&#8217;s taken over the town\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>We gotta get ready, we gotta get right\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>It&#8217;s going to be a battle in the NFL tonight.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> They literally waited until President Obama left office, because he said horrendous, racist things about President Obama, they waited until Obama left office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gretchen Carlson:\u003c/strong> You mean when he went to John Boehner played golf with President Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hank Williams, Jr:\u003c/strong> Oh yeah, yeah and Biden and Kasich, yeah. Aha.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GC:\u003c/strong> What did you not like about it? It seems to be a really pivotal moment for you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HW, Jr:\u003c/strong> Come on, come on. It&#8217;d be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu. OK?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GC:\u003c/strong> OK.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HW, Jr.:\u003c/strong> And the country this shape is in, the shape this country&#8217;s in, I mean.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BK:\u003c/strong> So I don&#8217;t understand that analogy actually.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HW, Jr.:\u003c/strong> Well I&#8217;m glad you don&#8217;t, brother, because a lot of people do. You know, they&#8217;re the enemy. They&#8217;re the enemy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BK:\u003c/strong> Who is the enemy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HW, Jr:\u003c/strong> Obama!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> And then brought him right back to open up for Monday Night Football. And so for anybody to say, &#8220;Hey, Colin shouldn&#8217;t be bringing politics to the field.&#8221; It&#8217;s already there. And I think the we have crossed a point where if nine months ago people were saying he shouldn&#8217;t be political, or other people are saying this is just a football decision. I think with comments from guys like Aaron Rodgers, but a few dozen athletes across the league, many of them who have been lifelong competitors of Colin, have all come out to say, &#8220;Listen, cut the crap. This is just about him not liking his politics and not liking the stand that he took.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that&#8217;s why I thought a boycott was necessary. Like that&#8217;s not OK. It&#8217;s not OK for a place like this to boot a man in the prime of his life because he took a peaceful stand against something that millions of us believe we should all be taking a stand against and that&#8217;s police brutality. It&#8217;s not a stand against police but a stand against police brutality, it&#8217;s a stand against injustice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to talk to you about Charlottesville and about this — what has become a very widespread campaign to try to take down these memorials of Confederate figures which many of them, as you well know, do not date back to the time of the Confederacy. They were built at key moments in much more recent American history as a way of directly confronting demands for equal rights or progress that was made on local levels in some of these municipalities. But I specifically want to ask you about this campaign that you spearheaded that seems to be gaining traction. And that is to identify and have charges brought against some of the men who were involved with this beating a young black man named Deandre Harris in a parking garage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> The parking garage of the Charlottesville Police Department, which is crazy. Like they were literally adjacent to the Charlottesville Police Department. Deandre Harris, a great kid, 19 years old, he serves as a special assistant in a special education classroom at a local elementary school. I hate to say it like this, but no criminal record, you know, great reputation and like thousands of counter protesters who wanted to just go there to show white supremacists who have showed up in huge numbers in their home — he lives in Charlottesville, he&#8217;s from there. And all these protesters who came there to demonstrate as white supremacist, as neo-Nazis but came from out of town, they came from all over the country, literally flew in from I&#8217;ve counted as many as 25 different states. This was a huge gathering.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and the car that killed, the car that was driven by the man who killed Heather Heyer was from, it was an Ohio licensed plate a car.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Absolutely and so these guys came in from out of town and so Deandre and Heather and others who lived there locally just said, &#8220;Hey, we have to show up.&#8221; And they had no plan, no strategy, they had never seen, like most of us, they&#8217;d never seen something like this with their own eyes, but they just wanted to be there to let people know, &#8220;Hey, this is not OK.” So there was a march of white supremacists who were going through the streets of downtown Charlottesville and Deandre and a group of others were also walking on the sidewalk alongside them, constantly yelling back and forth at them. And one of the white supremacists had a flag or flag pole with like a speared tip on the end of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And not Deandre, but another guy and a white supremacist started wrestling over that flag. And the white supremacist, who we have not been able to identify, gets the flag and gets ready to ram the tip of it into Deandre&#8217;s friend. And as they do that, Deandre takes a swing at a guy and misses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And all of a sudden, in an instant, a group of guys who are marching many of who didn&#8217;t even see what I just described to you. Like, all of this is on film in four different angles, you see it literally from every side, they just converge right on Deandre. And one guy knocks him to the ground, and then at least five guys maybe six, just began to pummel him and literally jumping in the air, coming down with their feet, their fist, with pipes, flagpoles, and just mauled him for what Deandre said felt like minutes but in a probably being more like twenty seconds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it was twenty seconds of nonstop beating. And, he finally was able to scramble out and then he stumbles literally right to the doorsteps of the police department. And you see, in the videos, the police are right there. They saw the incident unfold, and if you see any videos from that day, police had taken such a hands-off approach, that they were letting almost anything go, to the point that we saw just a few weeks ago another member of the KKK. literally pulled out a gun and shot at someone and the police were right there and just let him shoot. And he just kept on walking. Just an insane — an insanely mismanaged moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How many of the individuals who beat Deandre Harris have been charged?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> So this is what&#8217;s crazy. So the day it happened, people from Charlottesville started messaging me right away and saying, &#8220;Listen, there&#8217;s a guy who was very badly beaten.&#8221; And several guys even said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got photos, I&#8217;ve got videos.&#8221; And I posted the first image that I found on my timeline on Twitter and Facebook, and said —and it was, to me, what will become an iconic image because you see him on the ground, you see two men whose feet are completely off the ground as they jump up to come down on top of him, you see two weapons in midair coming down on him. And I just tweeted, &#8220;Let&#8217;s find out who these guys are.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My thought was because of the size of my network and as tense of a moment as our country was in, that it would probably be a few days and we would find everybody there. Because within three days I had clear pictures of almost everyone involved.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Some of them had some obfuscation of their face, but most of them were just openly —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Yeah there&#8217;s one guy who has on really heavy goggles and a hat and ironically he is that, we&#8217;re now closer to finding him, but the first man that we found was a young man named Dan Borden, also from Ohio, a lot of these guys did come in from Ohio, and Dan Borden, it was actually a member of his family who contacted me and said, &#8220;I know who that is.&#8221; And several of his high school classmates, he literally just finished high school year ago, and so once we clearly identified it was Dan Borden I tweeted, &#8220;Hey, we have identified Dan Borden.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he three days after we&#8217;d identified Dan Borden, several people began saying to me personally that they knew who another guy was and his name was Michael Alex Ramos. And they sent me videos of him saying that he was a part of it. And we also had a video of Dan saying he did it. And so I felt very comfortable identifying Dan Borden and Michael Alex Ramos because we had videos of them admitting it. We had a treasure trove of photos from their own profiles of them there and several days later someone from the Charlottesville Police Department contacted me and asked me if I would give them all the information I had, and I did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A few days after that, two different agents from the FBI reached out to me and asked me if I would give them everything I had and I did. And still, was probably a week later and they had not arrested Dan Borden or Alex Ramos, and finally they issued arrest warrants, first for Dan, then for Alex and arrested them and charged them. And what was disturbing about it was that it&#8217;s clear that the only people they have identified are the people that we identified. And, even in my conversations with the FBI agents, it was clear like they explicitly told me that everything they knew about the incident that they got from my timeline.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And let&#8217;s, for people that aren&#8217;t, Shaun King has more than three quarters of a million people following him on Twitter. And I mean, to me, it&#8217;s evidence of what Twitter is best at. You know, obviously it&#8217;s a cesspool of awfulness in some ways, but what you did there was you basically did this networked autonomous network of people that were investigating it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> So yeah, so that can go wrong in a thousand different ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And it does. Like, Reddit. Reddit is like, constantly identifying the wrong people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> And so I knew that and I also had a friend of mine and who was identified as the shooter of police officers in Texas, he was there in Dallas and he was a peaceful protest, but he had an AR-15 with him. And he was literally put on television stations all over the world including CNN for almost two hours as being the shooter who killed multiple police officers there in Texas. His life has never recovered from being misidentified as that. He has been— he had nothing to do with the shooting. He never knew the shooter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, same was true with Boston Marathon bombing, you know, you had the New York Post with a very racist, not that it&#8217;s like uncommon for them to have a racist front page, but a racist front page completely flagrantly misidentifying as suspect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> So, seeing all of that, I was extremely careful to not put out who I thought it might be or who it could be. So I literally, I kid you not, I Skyped with multiple white supremacists, who were there, who looked very much like the other guys, because I couldn&#8217;t — I couldn&#8217;t confirm if it was them or not. And so I literally found guys, found their information, asked if they would FaceTime or Skype with me. And once, once they said yes, I assumed it&#8217;s probably not him. But sure enough, these were white supremacists who were there, who I Skyped with and interviewed to determine if it was them and it wasn&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You should do like a video series, “Shaun King Skypes with white supremacists.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> [laughs] The calls were terrible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I can&#8217;t even imagine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> It was comical in this sense, that they were terrible guys who were there who were also very terrified of the idea of being misidentified. They didn&#8217;t have anything to do with it. And so I&#8217;m not too compassionate for white supremacists who are misidentified, I just knew I wasn&#8217;t going to be responsible for it. And so I thought that once I shared the photos that it would take a few days, particularly once local, state, and federal authorities got involved, here we are a month later and the only two people they arrested were the people we crowd sourced on Twitter. So, crazy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you believe, based on what we know about Donald Trump, his past, his public record and his nine months of the presidency, do you believe that he is a white supremacist?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> I do. Yeah, I really do. I don&#8217;t think he would, of course, he would never say that. When we say white supremacists, we immediately get an image in our mind of someone in the KKK or we get a like a bearded redneck from Mississippi, but I think over the long haul of his life, dating back to lawsuits from the federal government in the 70s, he has consistently been racist. And to me the foundation for American racism is this philosophy of white supremacy that some people are better than others. There are some fascinating clips of him talking about “some people are born better than others.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Oprah:\u003c/strong> Is it possible for everybody to be what you become?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> No, it&#8217;s not, but it&#8217;s possible for a lot of people to become successful and even very successful. I mean you have to be given, and this is where luck comes in, you have to be born lucky in the sense that you have to have the right the right genes to go out, and if it&#8217;s in my business, if it&#8217;s making deals —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> The world is not fair. You know, they come with this statement all men are created equal — well it sounds beautiful and it was written by some very wonderful people and brilliant people, but it&#8217;s not true because all people and all men aren&#8217;t created — Now today, they say all men and women, of course they wouldn&#8217;t change that statement that was made many years ago. But the fact is: You have to be born and blessed with something up here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Whether we use the term white supremacist, white nationalist, or racist or bigot, they all have distinctions that are important. But I do, I believe that he believes some people are better than others. I think it&#8217;s the foundation of his immigration policies, it&#8217;s the foundation of why he wants to build an enormous wall. So it&#8217;s not me and you in a room guessing. Neo-nazis, Klan members, and others see him and believe he is one of them. He has not done nearly enough to dissuade them from their support. And many men including David Duke were in Charlottesville saying —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>David Duke:\u003c/strong> We are determined to take our country back. We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That&#8217;s what we believed in. That&#8217;s why we voted for Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Trump basically gave them coded language that he supported them in so many ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> If you look at both sides, I think there&#8217;s blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don&#8217;t have any doubt about it either. What about the alt-left, they came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right. Do they have any semblance of guilt?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that we very fine people, on both sides, you had people in that group, excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures that as you did. You had people —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> I think Ta-Nehisi Coates, he has a new piece calling Donald Trump the first white president. I disagree with Coates on a lot of things, but I actually thought that piece was brilliant. And he talked about how of course there were 43 white presidents before Barack Obama. But none of them ran on being white. There whiteness was just inferred, it was just a part of who they were, they had power because of it, but they weren&#8217;t running on whiteness. But that Donald Trump in many ways was the first person to win the presidency off of whiteness. And I think Ta-Nehisi is right. I just hadn&#8217;t considered it in that way, and Donald Trump knew that, and doubled down on it, saying he would, if people at his rallies injured protesters, he said he would pay for their legal defense. And so they did. And he didn&#8217;t pay for their legal defense because he&#8217;s a liar, but he encouraged the violence. He even said he wanted to hit people. You know? And so he has appealed to the worst instincts of our country and I think we&#8217;re just now understanding the harm that he&#8217;s caused and I think it will be decades trying to work ourselves out of the damage he&#8217;s done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Shaun King, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SK:\u003c/strong> Yeah, thank you man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Shaun King is an activist and an independent columnist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical Interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, we&#8217;re going to end today&#8217;s show with the Chicago-born art rapper Open Mike Eagle. He has a new album dropping this week called Brick Body Kids Still Daydream. It&#8217;s a concept album of sorts about his memories of the Robert Taylor Homes, a group of buildings built by the Chicago Housing Authority, and considered to be the largest housing complex in the country. They stretched two miles across the South Side of Chicago and the buildings were an ominous symbol of segregation, even in the northern parts of the United States, as well as the brutal failings and contradictions of the public housing system that was a linchpin of the liberal agenda in the aftermath of World War II.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The last of the Robert Taylor Homes were demolished in 2007, but the spaces that they once inhabited remain vacant and undeveloped. Our producer Jack D&#8217;Isidoro spoke to Open Mike Eagle, who now lives in Los Angeles, about his inspiration for his new album and what is left when a community of color is displaced amidst a rising tide of gentrification.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Open Mike Eagle &#8220;Dark Comedy Late Show&#8221;]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Open Mike Eagle:\u003c/strong> My name is Open Mike Eagle. I make rap songs. And I live in Los Angeles, California.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The album is about existential dread that is specifically rooted in the experience of having spent time in the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago which now no longer exist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>News Anchor:\u003c/strong> A Chicago skyline, five miles south of the one most people know, this is Robert Taylor Homes, the largest housing project in the world, the poorest urban community in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>OME:\u003c/strong> My aunt and a bunch of my first cousins and my great grandmother lived there. I was on an airplane and I thought about those buildings and thought about how when you drive along the Dan Ryan Expressway now, you used to see those buildings lined the side of it. And you don&#8217;t see that anymore because, they&#8217;re not there, and I thought about, &#8220;Dang, what&#8217;s there now?&#8221; Cuz I drive through those neighborhoods right now and I don&#8217;t see anything new. And so I was on the airplane and I looked up what became of it. And I learned that nothing became of it and I started looking at videos that they have of the buildings being demolished and it came with these trigger warnings, you know, for people who lived there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was thinking about the projects and the demolition of them with an adult brain that understood business and public policy and the forces that went into those buildings being erected and the forces that went into them being demolished and just being horrified to find it that land had not been redeveloped at all. That was the feeling that made me want to write more and explore more about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>News Anchor:\u003c/strong> Today, virtually all of its 3,543 families are black. All are poor, with a median family income of $5,182. That&#8217;s fifty percent below the poverty line and only 1/6 the national median income for a family of four. Most families here are totally dependent on public aid. Most are headed by unmarried women. More than half the population is children.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>OME:\u003c/strong> And those are fascinating to me, and I also found a bunch of television documentaries that have been made about the Robert Taylors while they existed, profiling families there and those are fascinating, and I really just jumped into all of it like kinda right there on that airplane.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Eva Nash:\u003c/strong> I didn&#8217;t want to move into CHA but I didn&#8217;t have no other choice. It&#8217;s really not safe here, and I used to always say, all the time, when I used to see on TV before I moved in the projects, that I would never move in the projects. But the other buildings were we stayed at, they got condemned or the water was cut off, we didn&#8217;t have no way to flush the toilet. And the lady from the Urban Progress Center came out and asked us if we&#8217;d like to move. And we told her yeah, so that&#8217;s how we got to move into the CHA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>OME:\u003c/strong> When you knock a building down and you put a freeway there or you put a football stadium there, it gives people at least something else to look at, and some sense of purpose for them having lost that emotional touchstone of having a place where you lived or grew up. That&#8217;s just not a thing that really happens a lot in America. If you look at a community you look at a place thats been there for that many years and you know these buildings stood for 50 years, and to just have that erased, I don&#8217;t think you can possibly account for what you lose.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Open Mike Eagle, “95 Radios”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>OME:\u003c/strong> To me, it speaks to this his overall conversation about trauma, especially the trauma experienced by black people in America historically, and how, you know, you lose things and nobody really wants to have a conversation about them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think the crime is to expect people that have experienced trauma to just pick up and move on without any sort of taking a moment to stop and address it and heal, and I feel like that&#8217;s the overall frustration in the narrative of black American history, is just people going through the worst things and just always being expected to just buck up and move on. That&#8217;s not how humans operate. And it&#8217;s just constantly added to and not addressed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Open Mike Eagle &#8220;Dark Comedy Late Show&#8221;]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>OME:\u003c/strong> When I say my body is a building I am attempting to humanize a demolition in one sense, but I&#8217;m also attempting to like draw a line between the apathy I sometimes perceive to the destruction of black people&#8217;s bodies by like police brutality or even violence in the community, like that sort of apathy life. Like the same apathy where people are just like, &#8220;Ok, we&#8217;ll just, we&#8217;ll just vote the projects away.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know even the people inside of them, just not having a connection to the pain of that, not having a connection to understanding that that&#8217;s something that needs to be processed. And I feel like that&#8217;s a parallel you can draw to when you know a black man is killed by police and has a lot of people in society whose first thought would be, &#8220;Well, what did that person do wrong?&#8221; rather than identifying with the pain of like a mother having lost a child. You know, like whatever obstacle that is to empathy I feel like it&#8217;s kind of the same process by which people don&#8217;t think about the human lives of people in those sorts of community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This song is called &#8220;Brick Body Complex&#8221; and it&#8217;s from the album Brick Body Kids Still Daydream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Don’t call me nigger or rapper\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>My motherfucking name is Michael Eagle\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I’m sovereign I&#8217;m from a line of ghetto superheroes\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I holler\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I got something to bring to your attention\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I promise you\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I will never fit in your descriptions\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I’m giant\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Don’t let nobody tell you nothing different\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>They lying\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>A giant and my body is a building\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>No services underground\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>No sound when I’m\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Calling home\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>City broken my brothers down\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Now I’m standing here all alone\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Sun weathered my monochrome\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>My hollow bones\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>David Bowie told me I’m not alone\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I’m overgrown with these model homes\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Still here if it’s hot or cold\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Still here if my body move\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Still standing on Cottage Grove\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Still do what I gotta do\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Stone tablet on stone tablet\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I’m old granite\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I’m not a tomb\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Y’all can move this whole planet\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I’ll hold fast and I’ll follow through\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>I promise you\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>They took us to shelters, basements, hallways\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Early morning Sundays, midnight all day\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Do what the adults say, don’t engage in horseplay\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>People speak in tongues\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>My other name is 3925\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Make sure that my story’s told\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>16 or so stories high\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Constructed 55 years ago\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Winter weather yeah here we go\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Chi-Town in building code\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Stood here for 10 million snows\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Windchill is all in my bones\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Indivisibile in divisible kids and criminals young and old\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>No radiator my dungeon cold\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Thunder humming you something slow\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>20 down and just one to go\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>City say they gonna knock me down\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Still wearing my iron hood\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Told y&#8217;all you wont stop me now\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>They took us to shelters, basements, hallways\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Early morning Sundays, midnight all day\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Do what the adults say, don’t engage in horseplay\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>People speak in tongues\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Momma’s in the basement, smoking something\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>We grew up in hazes, projects, dungeons\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Graduation luncheons, try to make us something\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>See what we’d become\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That does it for this week&#8217;s show.

But it&#8217;s a form of dumb that is so unbelievably dangerous for the entire world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And of course, you know, Trump did his customary bragging, &#8220;Oh the stock market&#8217;s doing so amazing because of me&#8221; and &#8220;America&#8217;s finally getting on its way back to greatness, blah, blah, blah.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the speech Trump also boasted that the U.S. was finally going to have a massive military budget — finally — as though it&#8217;s been relying on like GoFundMe or Kickstarter for all that war and drone bombing and occupying countries that the Kenyan socialist Obama was doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Last month I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations. Not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But what Trump was referring to is that the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved $80 billion in increased military spending. A $700 billion budget for the military.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this wasn&#8217;t some super-secret White House operation sponsored by Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange. No, this was done with the support of almost every single Democrat in the Senate — only four Democrats voted against that funding bill, as did Bernie Sanders and three Republicans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This bill that the Democrats supported, it gave even more money to the military than Trump had asked for, for things like fighter aircraft and extra ships. Bring this up the next time you hear one of these Democratic leaders or their supporters pooh pooh Bernie Sanders and his allies and their Medicare-for-all plan, because, oh! How are we going to pay for it? They gave Trump more than he asked for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Or like when Hillary Clinton was chastising Bernie Sanders over his plan to offer free college. She said it was like Sanders asking America to buy a pony. Hello? Sanders&#8217; proposal for free public college tuition, that was estimated to cost $47 billion a year. But the Democrats just gave Trump $80 billion in increased funding, $700 hundred billion total, for more wars and weapons and sweetheart deals with big defense corporations. That&#8217;s real principle there. That&#8217;s fighting for the little man. None of this “Buy America, pony shit.” Let&#8217;s get more cluster bombs and cruise missiles and boots on the ground. Yeah, let&#8217;s give the insane lunatic in the White House more than he actually asked for. #resistance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To kick off the show today, we&#8217;re going to take a deep dive look at one of the most powerful voices in Donald Trump&#8217;s head when it comes to economic issues and that is the voice of Goldman Sachs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Remember how Trump attacked Hillary Clinton for giving big money speeches at Goldman Sachs? I mean it was a totally legitimate criticism of Hillary Clinton, and Wall Street loves the Clintons, but then Trump, once he becomes president turns around and brings in more Goldman Sachs people to the administration than Bush or Obama ever had at a given time during their entire two-term presidencies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Among the Goldman Sachs Mafia Don’s masquerading as public servants in the White House is Gary Cohn. Gary Cohn was the president of Goldman Sachs before Donald Trump named him as the head of the National Economic Council and Trump&#8217;s top economic adviser.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss what some people call “Government Sachs,” I&#8217;m joined now by Gary Rivlin. He&#8217;s a reporting fellow with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute. He&#8217;s also a former New York Times reporter. And along with Michael Hudson, Gary has a fascinating story up at The Intercept this week, called &#8220;Government by Goldman: Gary Cohn is giving Goldman Sachs everything it ever wanted from the Trump Administration.&#8221; Gary Rivlin, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gary Rivlin\u003c/strong>: It&#8217;s great to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s start with kind of, I think what for most people is the obvious hypocrisy here, the sort of top level hypocrisy, which is that Trump railed against Hillary Clinton, characterizing her as the Goldman Sachs candidate when they were fighting each other for the presidency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> She got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all our friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs, and everybody else. And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out. And she lied.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And yet, as you point out in your piece, Trump at its peak had six people who had worked for Goldman Sachs in his administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Right, actually, technically five, because the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was a lawyer for Goldman Sachs and married to someone who works at Goldman Sachs, so I don&#8217;t know if we can include him as one of them. It&#8217;s interesting you always hear the —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s give it a half. We&#8217;ll say five and a half.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Five and a half. It&#8217;s interesting because, you know, you hear that “oh Goldman Sachs wins no matter who wins the White House,” and there&#8217;s a lot of truth to that. You go back and every administration has one, maybe two. George W. Bush at his peak had three Goldman Sachs veterans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, having the five and a half, if we determine that that&#8217;s what it is, is much more of a Goldman contingency. Elizabeth Warren had a very funny line, you know, the White House is now a branch office of Goldman Sachs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. They can have their own wing of the White House. Especially with all these people leaving and getting fired, there definitely is the space in the White House for it. But why do you think it was that Hillary Clinton, that that hit her and it stuck with her that she was the candidate of Goldman Sachs?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> It started with Ted Cruz, who was in quotes in bed with Goldman Sachs, his wife had worked for Goldman Sachs at the time. To me, Goldman Sachs for Donald Trump was just the easy shorthand. I think we all use that. Goldman Sachs is almost a stand-in for Wall Street, manipulating money in, you know, businesses that really don&#8217;t do anything then help take apart other businesses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> But you know for Hillary, you take $650 grand, whatever the exact number was, for three speeches. That&#8217;s going to stick to you. And, you know, besides that, her policies were generally very friendly. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO, and Gary Cohn, the president, were supporters of Hillary Clinton. Much of Wall Street supported Hillary Clinton. You know, we&#8217;ll have our nice little social liberal policies, but, you know, when it comes to business let&#8217;s calm down this financial regulation stuff, let&#8217;s be a little bit more in quotes, &#8220;friendly,&#8221; to business.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total, total control over him, just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton, they have total. But they have no control, they have no control over Donald Trump. I don&#8217;t want to their money, I don&#8217;t need their money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think will be really helpful to explain what Goldman Sachs is and what it does.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> So it&#8217;s an investment bank, and traditionally what an investment bank does is arrange financing for corporations and governments. So, the startup that goes public, initial public offering, a company needs to raise money to build a new factory, a government needs money for a bridge, or what have you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Interestingly, in the 1990s, I covered technology, I covered Silicon Valley. And Goldman Sachs, I always respected the Goldman Sachs guys back then, or people. Because they&#8217;re all smart and they had what they called long-term greed, rather what we see nowadays which is short-term greed\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Gary Cohn and Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman started there, that still was the main way they made money. But over the years it’s gotten much more into trading into derivatives, into buying and selling currencies, in interest rate swaps and these increasingly more complicated things — commodities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In large part because of the influence of Gary Cohn and Lloyd Blankfein, it turned from gentlemanly Goldman Sachs, which, again, I had some respect for back then, into this rip your face off, we no longer have customers, we just are trying to make as much money as we can in a short term greedy way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and part of that, as you write, was when Goldman itself went public, then this ethos of the client or the customer comes first, was replaced by, &#8220;Shit, we want to make a lot of money ourselves, too,” and that, and the priority was sort of the institution itself and making a lot of money for the people that run it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> When Goldman Sachs, before they went public in 1999, they were a partnership and so if the government fines you a few hundred million dollars for misbehavior, for bending the laws, for breaking the laws, you, as the partners, had to pay that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once it&#8217;s a publicly traded company, the company pays the fines and there&#8217;s no personal consequence for the misbehavior.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Talk about Gary Cohen&#8217;s role in the subprime mortgage catastrophe and Goldman&#8217;s key role in it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Cohn took over as president of Goldman Sachs, the number two spot, the president and chief operating officer in 2006, but most interesting to me were the four or five years leading up to 2006.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He, by happenstance, in the early 2000s, took over the mortgage-trading desk, the desk that would do mortgage-backed securities that, you know, these complex packaging of subprime loans, of loans of any kind, but what got all the attention, where it grew phenomenally was subprime loans. And it was Gary Cohn himself who aggressively got Goldman Sachs into mortgage-backed securities. They were a minor player when he took over this role within Goldman Sachs, and he turned them into a major player, meaning they were doing $100 billion of these or more every single year. And Goldman Sachs, which had barely been a player, became one of the major players in the securitization. At the same time, and this isn&#8217;t Gary Cohn, this is a company more generally, they were providing the lines of credit to AmeriQuest, one of the biggest subprime lenders to New Century, another one of the biggies in subprime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, they were both providing the capital to allow what turns out to be some nefarious players to be making these loans, and then they were a big player in buying up these loans right after they made, putting them into big packages and selling them to pension funds, to wealthy people, to whoever wanted to buy a piece of these. It was, it was quite the thing and you were making money for a while until you weren&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, explain that. What is the product that they were essentially asking these pension funds or other you know quote-unquote investors to buy into, when they were engaged in these subprime mortgages and the securities behind them?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> So, investment banks, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, all the major banks you&#8217;ve heard of that were involved in investment banking, they would buy up huge quantities of loans, largely subprime loans from lenders. And they would package them together in a single mortgage-backed security and then sell off small slices.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t sharing with their clients, what other banks were not sharing with their clients, is that what they were purporting were very safe investments, were not very safe investments. And we all saw the hard way, once it fell apart, loans that they were selling were suddenly worth 80 cents on the dollar, 50 cents on the dollar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so holding these packages, the underlying investment was worth less and less and less, to the point where they were virtually worthless.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> People were just defaulting left and right on the mortgages.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Right, default rates were huge on subprime mortgages.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And also, that we should remind people, that they basically eliminated almost any requirements for people to get a mortgage. But a big part of this was that they were taking advantage of poor people or people who had a desire to live beyond their means and shoving these mortgages at them and saying, &#8220;You could afford this mansion.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> And, you know, here again, we&#8217;re kind of — the old-fashioned way of banking versus the newfangled way of banking. In the old days, a bank really cared if you can afford to pay it back, because the bank held the mortgage for the 30 years that the terms were for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once you start with securitization, which became much more popular in the 80s and the 90s, suddenly the lender didn&#8217;t care, they&#8217;re going to get rid of this in a month anyway. Let me make the loan, make some quick money and let the next person down the line worry about whether the people are actually pay back the loan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Gary Cohn&#8217;s specific role in the subprime mortgage catastrophe?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> At the end of 2006, there&#8217;s a meeting inside Goldman, Gary Cohn&#8217;s not added, but he&#8217;s getting e-mails afterwards and then from then on is following very closely, there&#8217;s a whole e-mail trail that the Senate investigative committee looked into this, and so there&#8217;s a trove of e-mails, you could just dip in and see Gary Cohn and others in Goldman Sachs, but they said that, &#8220;Uh oh! We see this going south rather quickly, the subprime market.&#8221; And that&#8217;s where they came up with the big short, and that&#8217;s saying that, &#8220;Hey, those companies that we&#8217;ve been providing lines of credit to, AmeriQuest, New Century, let&#8217;s short those stocks, let&#8217;s bet against those stocks. Let&#8217;s find other ways of betting against the subprime market, because we think it&#8217;s going to go down and if we put this bet down, we&#8217;re going to make a lot of money because we&#8217;re shorting the market.&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, that&#8217;s what investment bankers do, they&#8217;re smart about money, they figure out what the trend is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The part that I think is unforgivable is that they never shared this information with their own customers. In fact, they had a problem. They&#8217;re buying up subprime loans all the time, they have billions and billions of dollars in subprime loans in their inventory, and so they have to get rid of them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>December of 2006 they say, &#8220;Ok, the big short, we believe the market&#8217;s going to go south.&#8221; Through the first half of 2007 through the summer of 2007, they&#8217;re still selling these mortgage-backed securities to their clients. There are e-mails that came out that they&#8217;re, in quotes, &#8220;shitty products.&#8221; “Hey, great job guys, making lemon out of lemonade.” With their job, as they describe it, is to provide information to their customers so they can make wise investments. They&#8217;re offloading these securities because of course they don&#8217;t want to own them, who wants to own mortgage-backed securities? They themselves have decided that these things are not going to be worth nearly what we paid for them. And so, they were secretly selling them the big short.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CARL LEVIN:\u003c/strong> How much of that shitty deal did you sell to your clients after June 22, 2007?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DANIEL SPARKS:\u003c/strong> Mr. Chairman, I, I don&#8217;t know the answer to that but the price would have reflected levels that they wanted to invest —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CL\u003c/strong>: Oh, they don&#8217;t know, you didn&#8217;t tell them you thought it was a shitty deal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DS:\u003c/strong> I didn&#8217;t say that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CL:\u003c/strong> No. Who did? Your people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> In fact, there is an e-mail that was sent to Gary Cohn from his chief financial operations officer, CFO, calling it The Big Short. I mean it&#8217;s become this famous expression that most people know nowadays. It was actually famously used within an e-mail to Gary Cohn, while he was president of Goldman Sachs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CHRISTIAN BALE (AS MICHAEL BURRY):\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m going to buy swaps on mortgage bonds, credit default swaps that will pay off, if the underlying bond fails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GOLDMAN SACHS SALES REP\u003c/strong>: You want to bet against the housing market.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CB (AS MB):\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GOLDMAN SACHS QUANT:\u003c/strong> Why? Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don&#8217;t pay their mortgages. That&#8217;s never happened in history.

Who went in and basically said, &#8220;I want you guys to allow me to short subprime loans.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I mean it is more than one character if you talk about all the banks, but in the case of Goldman Sachs, the one character was this guy John Paulson, he wasn&#8217;t well known then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Not related to Hank Paulson?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Right, Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush, who had been the CEO of Goldman Sachs right before that. It was one of George W. Bush&#8217;s three Goldman Sachs people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>John Paulson is this unknown hedge fund guy, or unknown to Goldman Sachs people. He comes in and is describing in early 2006, he wants to short the subprime market. And they&#8217;re thinking he&#8217;s a whackadoodle. Like, Ok, sure you want to do that, we will arrange this. You are gonna pay us fees for it? Ok. They did several of these for him and they suddenly realize they, hey, wait a second, he&#8217;s onto something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he goes from being, a customer to a rival. And they start doing what John Paulson did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, in fact there was one guy who taught them or, you know, opened their eyes to like, &#8220;Hey, this is not going to turn out very well.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump, you know, for all of his railing against Goldman Sachs in the context of Hillary Clinton, when he then starts appointing these Goldman people and then publicly has to sort of defend it, earlier this summer you write, &#8220;Trump boasted about his team of economic advisers at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> This is the president of Goldman Sachs. Smart. Having him represent us, he went from massive to paydays, to peanuts, to little tiny —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> He actually does. He went from $20 million a year, and has a very low salary, something like, 30, 40 grand a year. So, I guess, I guess he went from peanuts. There was a big advantage in him leaving. I don&#8217;t know if people know this, but when you take a government job, there&#8217;s this magic window where you can sell your stock and not pay capital gains, because, because you half to do it to satisfy ethics regulations. So, Gary Cohn, at this point, owns like $250 million of Goldman stock and he was able to sell it without paying capital gains, which you could rough, roughly estimate saves himself about $50 million.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, in that quote, he talks about the great pains and the great sacrifices, it cost him all this money, like, well, yes, he&#8217;s not making a salary, but boy that was, that was a nice little moment for him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But my favorite quote here that you guys point out of Trump&#8217;s is this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> So, somebody said, &#8220;Why did you appoint the rich person to be in charge of the economy?&#8221; [Laughter and clapping] I said — no, it&#8217;s true. I said because that&#8217;s the kind of thinking we want. I mean, you know, really because they&#8217;re representing the country. They don&#8217;t want the money. They&#8217;re representing —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump said he needed, &#8220;great, brilliant business minds, so the world doesn&#8217;t take advantage of us.&#8221; You write: &#8220;How else could he get the job done? Trump continues, &#8216;I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions I just don&#8217;t want a poor person. Does that make sense?&#8217; Trump asked. And the crowd cheered.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> You know, I mean, on the one hand, it&#8217;s the one and only time that Donald Trump has explained how he used Goldman Sachs on the campaign trail as a cudgel. Like, I&#8217;m going to beat you over the head, if you have any ties to Goldman Sachs. And then he turns around, and, you know, the treasury secretary is from Goldman Sachs. His chief political adviser for seven, eight months was from Goldman. I always wanted an explanation from that. I guess you could say that was an explanation. At least he acknowledged that there was this contradiction here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, I mean, isn&#8217;t that the Trump Administration. I&#8217;m going to fight for you, little guy, and if you look at what Gary Cohn is doing as Trump&#8217;s chief economic advisor, it&#8217;s a pretty radical agenda. It&#8217;s not radical in the sense of Steve Bannon radical, but he wants to cut corporate taxes by 57 percent. From 35 percent corporate tax to 15 percent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I went back and I figured out what kind of advantage would that be for Goldman Sachs. He had saved $1.5 to $2 billion a year. Goldman Sachs is, more than any other firm on Wall Street, is big in what&#8217;s called prop trading. That means using their own money to buy shopping centers and hotels and invest their own money. Under Dodd-Frank, the financial reform bill in 2010, they greatly limited prop trading. And about half of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s business to now, even though there&#8217;s a law against it, you know, is prop trading and of course he wants to do in Gary Cohn. You know all of Dodd-Frank, which includes prop trading, that&#8217;s worth billions and billions of dollars every single year to Goldman Sachs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, they talk about a different approach to infrastructure, the $1 trillion dollar infrastructure plan, it&#8217;s kind of left, right, middle. Everyone understands that we need to be dealing with our infrastructure problem in this country, but the Goldman Sachs plan, the plan that Gary Cohn gave President-elect Donald Trump when he was just Goldman Sachs&#8217;s president meeting with Donald Trump, before he was named to the White House, he said, &#8220;You know, why don&#8217;t we put up a little bit of money, in this case a couple hundred billion dollars of government money, and the rest will be private financing from Wall Street firms.&#8221; And guess what firm is among the three or four largest in the public infrastructure business? Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs is huge in IPOs. When Gary Cohn was president of Goldman Sachs, he was lobbying to loosen the initial public offering laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, six months into the administration, the FCC has loosened the IPO rules, which is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Goldman Sachs alone. And so here was a president who said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to represent you, little guy, because it&#8217;s the big firms like Goldman Sachs that are draining the economy, that are enriching themselves at your expense.&#8221; And in the position as, to head his economic policy team, is a guy who, down the line, you look at every policy, is trying to perpetuate the Goldman Sachs&#8217;s of the world. The Wall Street firms draining the economy at the expense of the little guy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump is on the one hand speaking with this, what&#8217;s meant to be kind of populist rhetoric that resonates with the middle class, and then when that seeps out into it, you start to see a revolt from some of his core supporters on the right. Not just this, but more of these conservative or alt-right type figures seem to be paying attention to the revelations in your article than people on the left thus far, in part because they feel betrayed by Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Right. I mean, if you voted for Trump because, wow! Someone&#8217;s going to finally fight for the little guy. And it&#8217;s not just like the president of Goldman Sachs is the chief economic advisor, but one of the main villains in the subprime meltdown, is now your guy? To help turn around the economy? I actually think one of the reasons Donald Trump won is because there are a lot of Tea Party people on the right, who are really angry at Wall Street for what happened in 2008. So taking one of those main villains and putting him to top your economic team, I think it really infuriates people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What does it feel like to be, this happened to me, too, but I just wanted to ask you, what does it feel like to be retweeted by Ann Coulter?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> (laughs) First of all —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It happened to me, too, I said I felt dirty as fuck, but let&#8217;s hear your version.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> First off, you sort of like, kind of rub your eyes, like, ok. I&#8217;m reading this wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Maybe it&#8217;s a parody account?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> No, no I actually had to go to Ann Coulter&#8217;s account and like, &#8220;Oh, wow, OK that&#8217;s Ann Coulter.&#8221; But to me one of the shocks is that, I mean, hear, Donald Trump, everybody there could be a whole newspaper about him. The coverage is crazy. And, you know, it&#8217;s never come out what we&#8217;re talking about that he&#8217;s one of the main villains of the subprime meltdown. Except for in one place. In the few months I&#8217;ve been working on this, I saw one place that talked about Gary Cohn in that context and it was Breitbart. You know? It&#8217;s like, they do get it. They do get that the swamp in their mind is Wall Street. Big money, big finance, and the power big industry and the power they have in Washington, and they&#8217;re trying to fight that, just like people on the left are trying to fight that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So yes, I was shocked, but then when I started thinking about it, sorta — I would say is about even, left and right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In the kind of one part of what sometimes characterized as a civil war within the White House between varying camps of influence around Trump, where does Gary Cohn fall. Like, who is he close to in the Trump Administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> So, almost from the start, he&#8217;s been part of the JIvanka — you know Jared, Ivanka Team. You know there&#8217;s — Cohn has been a Democrat for his adult life until now. If you look at his corporate, his political giving, until financial reform and Dodd-Frank in 2010, he skewed very much more Democrat than Republican. Since 2010 in financial reform, he&#8217;s skewed much more Republican than Democrat. But I would call him a Democrat up until now. So he&#8217;s the one that Steve Bannon would be railing against: “Globalist Gary” was an insult that they use for him. Or just, you know, one of the New York Democrats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Then it makes sense, too, that Breitbart would start beating the drums against Gary Cohn, also, I mean and Bannon, who, who knows what Bannon is going to do now that he&#8217;s, you know, he&#8217;s officially out of the White House. But it does seem like his campaign against the people that he identified as globalist is certainly going to continue unabated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> Well, but I think one thing that’s really important to say is in the shorthand of what we&#8217;re talking about, you know, Gary Cohn is a moderate. And yes, on climate change, on immigration, on other issues, he&#8217;s a moderate. But I think it&#8217;s really important that people don&#8217;t lose sight that there is a radical agenda here, a radical deregulation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we&#8217;ve seen this play out before. You know, Dodd-Frank ain&#8217;t perfect but it&#8217;s sure a hell of a better than what was there before.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And if the Trump administration is successful in taking apart Dodd-Frank, we&#8217;re going to have deregulation and we&#8217;re going to see the same thing happen again. Things like you can&#8217;t be leveraged 30-1. You can&#8217;t like, loan out 30 times the amount of money. When things fall apart, they fall apart disastrously. And you can&#8217;t just have banks betting their own money, prop trading, like it&#8217;s federally insured deposits. You know? Yeah JP Morgan Chase lost, in quotes, “its own money.” But if they can afford to give the depositors their money back, it&#8217;s our money, they&#8217;re losing. And there&#8217;s a, you know — it&#8217;s a radical agenda of deregulation that started in the Reagan years and played through the Clinton years and led to subprime. And I really fear that it&#8217;s going to be a radical agenda of deregulation that&#8217;s started during the Trump years and who knows how it&#8217;s going to play out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And just to repeat: cutting corporate taxes by more than 50 percent, you know what that&#8217;s going to do to our budget? I mean talk about deficits. We&#8217;re what, $20 trillion now. It&#8217;s radical. I don&#8217;t want to call it moderate because it&#8217;s not what a moderate would be pushing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What does it mean to have someone like Gary Cohn from Goldman Sachs in the key position that he&#8217;s in with Trump as president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> So, it&#8217;s a really interesting position he&#8217;s in. The National Economic Policy Director, and so, OK, Treasury has its view, Congress has its view, I&#8217;m supposed to take everyone&#8217;s point of view and give advice to the president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Traditionally, that position is someone from Wall Street who quits. And then goes into public service and I think some have legitimately at least tried to say, &#8220;OK, I&#8217;m no longer from Goldman Sachs or whatever company I&#8217;m from. I&#8217;m now going to wear a different hat and give advice. And the part that is really stunning to me, and it&#8217;s not just me speaking, it&#8217;s not just The Intercept speaking, you see in the Financial Times, you see it in The Economist criticizing this like, &#8220;Wow, that is not supposed to be, &#8216;Hey, this is now our chance to help run government and you know now we&#8217;re Government Sachs instead of, you know, Goldman Sachs.'&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Record a snippet of it in the story, where there&#8217;s actually an interview he&#8217;s giving, or a speech he&#8217;s giving, where he&#8217;s using &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221; and it&#8217;s just kind of obvious to me that he&#8217;s still kind of thinking Goldman Sachs. Like, no, no, no, &#8220;we&#8221; is &#8220;we,&#8221; dude. Here it&#8217;s not Goldman Sachs. All of his interviews that I found: CNBC, Wall Street Journal, you know, Bloomberg, it really is interesting, he&#8217;s still the president of Goldman Sachs, in his approach to the job, in his philosophy. I have been paying attention this guy intensely for seven, eight, nine months now, and he has not said a word that is different than the what he was saying as the president of Goldman Sachs. His policies prior to his appointment seem to me exactly the same as his policies and priorities since his appointment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, we going to leave it there. Gary Rivlin, thank you so much for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GR:\u003c/strong> My pleasure. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Gary Rivlin is a reporting fellow with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute. He&#8217;s the co-author of a story up at The Intercept this week called: &#8220;Government by Goldman.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this is Intercepted. When we come back, we&#8217;re going to talk about the paramilitarization of police in the United States and how Israel is training cops across the US. We&#8217;re also going to be joined by the brilliant poet and activist, Aja Monet. She&#8217;s also going to share some of her spoken word. Stay with us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Wow, there are so many more incredible things you could be listening to rather than The Intercept. Alex Jones or how about survival food bucket infomercials. Jim Baker&#8217;s all over that stuff. Listen to an air conditioner hum. That&#8217;s going to be better than this show. But don&#8217;t listen to The Intercept, because it&#8217;s truth, and we can&#8217;t handle that. I can&#8217;t handle it. Listen to the earlier podcasts. You&#8217;ll get the joke.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We are back here on Intercepted and that was Anthony Atamanuik doing Trump. Anthony is the host of Comedy Central&#8217;s, &#8220;The President Show.&#8221; But before that, Anthony was doing Trump for Intercepted. A new season of his Comedy Central show premieres this Thursday, September 21st at midnight. And when Anthony dropped by our studio to do the Trump segment for the beginning of this show, I asked him for his thoughts on all the love that was showered on Trump&#8217;s recently departed press secretary, Sean Spicer, at the Emmys.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> I was very disappointed by the disconnect between the rhetoric of a lot of wealthy people in that room and their actions at a moment where they could&#8217;ve taken an opportunity to distance themselves from essentially the Lenny Riefenstahl of the Trump Administration, with none of the photographic talent, which is even more disappointing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Stephen Colbert:\u003c/strong> I mean, is their anyone who can say how big the audience is? Sean do you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sean Spicer:\u003c/strong> This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SC:\u003c/strong> Melissa McCarthy everybody, give it up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s sort of a split thing, which is that I don&#8217;t believe that those types of things do massive influence in terms of voting and decision making, like I think we overestimate the value, in a way, of TV entertainment influencing people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But that&#8217;s a separate concept from sort of the moral compass that we&#8217;re setting for ourselves in terms of associating with people who are reinforcing, really directly white supremacy in the United States. And I think at a core level, if you strip away, although they&#8217;re all intertwined, economic policy, education policy, energy policy, foreign policy, if you strip all that away, there is a movement that is dangerously percolating, not only in our country but around the world, in a way that it hasn&#8217;t for 80 years, you know, 70, 80, 90 years and we are not taking it seriously. And I, I feel like each of these moments of this tacit endorsement and, I don&#8217;t want to say humanizing, but normalizing and forgiving of someone&#8217;s participation in elevating a type of thinking that&#8217;s destructive to civilization, I think is offensive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s Anthony Atamanuik. He&#8217;s host of The President Show on Comedy Central. He&#8217;s also the resident Trump whisperer here on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we&#8217;ve said repeatedly on this show, one of the key components of fascism and authoritarianism is stomping out free expression. Crushing cultural and creative independence. That&#8217;s why we play the music of artists and performers who stand for something, whose work contributes to making the world better or understanding the times in which we live. And we&#8217;re going to continue to air these voices and share their work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the Brooklyn-born, Cuban-Jamaican poet Aja Monet has emerged as a powerful voice of struggle. Struggle for justice against police violence, violence against women, racism, capitalism, and war. She&#8217;s also spent time on the ground in Palestine and she&#8217;s become an outspoken critic of Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aja Monet&#8217;s weapon is her poetry and her spoken word, and she has a new collection of poetry that&#8217;s just been published by Haymarket books. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;My Mother was a Freedom Fighter.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aja Monet joins us now. Aja, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Aja Monet:\u003c/strong> Thank you, thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s a lot I want to ask you about, but I first wanted to go in on the title of your latest book, &#8220;My Mother Was a Freedom Fighter.&#8221; Maybe you could just explain where the inspiration for that title came from?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> So the title is from a poem that is called &#8220;My Mother Was a Freedom Fighter&#8221; and the poem essentially covers what I feel is the story of the trajectory of women who have nurtured and who have had to take care of other people and raise society and raise cultures and raise civilizations. And we think about mothers in such a, like we say it in a very romantic way, like, &#8220;Oh, my mother, I wouldn&#8217;t be here without my mother, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t think we talk about it very practically. Like, what women do and what specifically women who bear children and take care of children, or maybe not be able to bear children, but nurture and take care of other people&#8217;s children, they teach the values of society.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, I feel like every woman I know who has tried to exist in contemporary society, at least, or in any society in their time, has struggled to be and exist and to love and to nurture, and to raise up other nurturing loving people. And I think we haven&#8217;t really seen, at least in America, we haven&#8217;t seen a lot of support around what women do for society and the values that they instill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the first poem is called, &#8220;The Emerging Woman After Aborting a Girl&#8221;:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Eight A.M. in September, my daughter chose to show up at my doorstep, unannounced.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Had the nerve to come talk to me about being a mother when I wasn&#8217;t ready for no giving up my life to mother no ungrateful child. Wasn&#8217;t in no place to open no doors, to let her see my empty cupboard, to open my empty fridge, I ain&#8217;t got time to explain to no child why I write poems to relic the ruckus, why I collect Sallie Mae letters in bags and post collages on walls, or why I can&#8217;t love the way nobody taught me how. Or why my flaws show up in her face, or how my dimples fall deep in her cheekbone. Ain&#8217;t got the heart to reason with her, my selfish choices are all the ways I couldn&#8217;t be of sacrifice,\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I couldn&#8217;t be nobody&#8217;s Christ, I ain&#8217;t got enough hours in the day to be somebody&#8217;s God.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I look at her face, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to open the door, I couldn&#8217;t stand to see her through the peephole. All my life flashed before my eyes and one day — one day she&#8217;ll be a woman, or not. Have some children of her own, or not. She&#8217;ll understand, or not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Not till she does will she know the depth, how we raise our heartaches and love the world whole, healing through snatches at glimpses of ourselves, while we offer pieces of flesh to this earth. Nah, there ain&#8217;t no mother here. You best be on your way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hmm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> And, this is &#8220;Dream Deferred&#8221;:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I wear a wreath of miscarriages, the right and wrong of it. Heavily drugged, I bled and bled watching droplets of me swirl down the drain. My breasts were voltaic to touch, shouting words at doorknobs, I cry my worst cry. Ugly, my mouth is frightened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My partner cannot face me, he is on call. Everywhere we go, I am a single mother mourning in public. My joy is short-lived. I mutter confessions to strangers, &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, I promise. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So those, you chose those pieces in the context of this conversation, what was the — what was going through your mind or what, what&#8217;s the connection.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> The first one was a poem that I wrote trying to reconcile the things that were told to me about having a child, and how that might have shaped the moment where I didn&#8217;t want to have to have a child, and I didn&#8217;t think I was ready, and I didn&#8217;t think the life was really. I mean I say, &#8220;Eight AM in September, my daughter chose to show up at my doorstep unannounced,&#8221; you know? &#8220;Had the nerve to come talk to me about being a mother/when I wasn&#8217;t ready for no giving up my life/ to mother no ungrateful child.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Part of that is, you know, these are things that are said from, from mothers that, and my mother, you know, that I know had she had more support had she been around a better relationship with her mother, that perhaps it would have been a very different response to having a child.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s a very different woman who emerges after a woman decides to not keep a child. I think you have come into questions about what does it mean to be a woman, why are you bestowed this responsibility, quote-unquote, why does your body change, and what does it do and how does that affect you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, I think it was a moment where I felt mostly transformed and also that I needed to find a way to process what I was feeling. You know, that sometimes words help you communicate that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Dream Deferred,&#8221; was for me, it has a lot of meanings and, I don&#8217;t know, without crying, I don&#8217;t know how comfortable I will feel speaking about it but, my partner is the head of an organization called, &#8220;Dream Defenders&#8221; and Langston Hughes wrote a poem called you know — speaking on a “dream deferred&#8221; and &#8220;a raisin in the sun” and “what happens to a dream deferred?&#8221; And he speaks about it from the perspective of a black person in America, what happens to someone when they don&#8217;t fulfill their dream. And, for me, this was a time when I was in a different place in my life and I thought I would have loved to have a child and I was at the best place to in my spirit and ability and I couldn&#8217;t. And I didn&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And everyone around me had seen the hysteria of what I was engaging in, or what that felt like, but they couldn&#8217;t understand it, and so that&#8217;s why I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a single mother/mourning in public.&#8221; Something about it was, you felt like, he couldn&#8217;t understand it, he couldn&#8217;t empathize, there was no, you know, as sad as it is, there was little to no compassion, I think men have very little understanding of what women — what questions women are forced to face in light of how their bodies are. In light of what their bodies do and speak and say for them, and the spirit of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there was a moment for me in this poem where I felt like I, I spoke up, feeling so silenced about the whole such situation. A lot of my poems are the ways that I kind of speak to the situation and I try to resolve something in it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In terms of the world that you live in and the work that you do and the creativity of your work, does it change from president to president? Particularly in the case of having, I mean you wrote you wrote a poem that really cut to the heart of the hypocrisy of some key parts of Barack Obama&#8217;s legacy, which also is one of my favorite poems that you wrote in terms of the overly political work. Has it changed you or your view of the world at all to have someone like Donald Trump in power and saying some things overtly and plainly that are considered a little more couth if you only whisper them in the corridors of power in Washington, rather than tweet them or say them out loud?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s not different. It&#8217;s no different. I think it&#8217;s different for a lot of white people. A majority felt like this country was progressive because it had a black president. And so, I think people were really blind to what&#8217;s actually going on in this country and what&#8217;s always been going on. And so, for me I think Trump is only a reflection of their quote-unquote worst, but there&#8217;s even worse out there. I think white folks have to face who Trump is, you know, they need to face what he represents and what he&#8217;s spewed to the world and the values that he&#8217;s demonstrating that he believes are American.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve always known America was not him and I&#8217;ve always known that America was not great. And so, it&#8217;s not lost on me that, you know, we have a lot of work to do. We&#8217;ve always had a lot of work to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think now it just gets more people at the protests maybe. People are trying to find their own ways of making a difference, in a more profound — because I think for a lot of America it was all about how much money can I make, and when you brought up race or sexism or any of those things it was like, &#8220;Oh, you did, you get in the way of money, so shut up.&#8221; You know? And so, we have to find ways to really redefine what it means to be human. We&#8217;ve always had to do that. And what it means to love one another, and to truly stand for freedom, equality, justice, those are all things that only the people who have been fighting this country really know, because they&#8217;ve been pushing the country to really stand for what it means.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Maybe you could share, &#8220;it is what it was.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> &#8220;it is what it was&#8221;:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When your president bails out the banks not the students, it don&#8217;t make no difference if he&#8217;s black or blue. All you care about is how much money you got before you overdraft your account. For reading books and writing essays and all you got to show for it is garnished checks, cups of noodles, fancy friends, and terms your family don&#8217;t understand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They just want to know why you got two degrees, and no health care and no decent income.

Talk about your involvement with making some people think of it as a hashtag, #sayhername, because it went viral on Twitter and on social media. But maybe talk about that campaign, if you can call it that, and your role in it, and what was at the center of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AM:\u003c/strong> I was reached out to by Eve Ensler, who was working with, I believe it was Kimberly Crenshaw she was working with on it. Rachel Gilmer, who now is the co-director of Dream Defenders in South Florida, who was helping to organize this event that they wanted to do that would share and pay homage to all the women who have been murdered by police.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Because, I don&#8217;t think it matters whether you&#8217;re women or men, who&#8217;s murdered by the police, it&#8217;s just wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, you know, we do tend to memorialize and lift-up the names of men a lot more than we do women, I think that&#8217;s just, in all scenarios that happens, and in this specific situation, the mantra was &#8220;Say Her Name.&#8221; You know, there&#8217;s power in a name. There&#8217;s power and people&#8217;s spirits are carried through names, and so how do we lift-up these names and let them know that one, they&#8217;re not forgotten, and two, the world is going to do something about it and their lives weren’t lost in vain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, Eve Ensler asked me if I would read a poem, and at the at the time I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to say or what I was going to read, and so I wrote this maybe about a few hours before the, the actual rally in Union Square.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I was, I think there&#8217;s a lot of pressure when you&#8217;re a writer, just in general, to write things on a deadline. But there is always even more pressure when it’s for the people, and you want the people to feel it, and you want them to know where you&#8217;re coming from and you want people to feel elevated or risen in some way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, I think there was a, there&#8217;s still issues I always have with my writing, where I&#8217;m constantly grappling with, did I communicate when I really want? Did people really get, come away with what I hope they did, and did I, did I speak truth to power for myself?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so &#8220;say her name&#8221; for me was a poem that I felt needed to be written. And I was grateful I was asked to read it because it was my marching order, it was what I was called to do so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, &#8220;#sayhername&#8221;:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I am a woman carrying other women in my mouth.

That&#8217;s a government scheme under which local and state police agencies in the United States can purchase excess military equipment, including armored vehicles and grenade launchers from the military.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, this program started in the 1990s, but it only really started to catch attention of a wider swath of the population in in recent years because of the massive paramilitarized operations that have become commonplace during large protests as occurred in Ferguson or in Baltimore, where you see these paramilitarized cops facing down against people who are coming out to protest the killing of black and brown people by police.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, for most of Obama&#8217;s presidency, the 1033 program operated as it always had, it operated at full steam. But then in 2015, Obama decided to place some restrictions on it in direct response to the images of these militarized police confronting protesters. While Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the announcement on behalf of Trump that they would be getting rid of Obama&#8217;s restrictions and sessions made that announcement in a speech in front of the Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff Sessions:\u003c/strong> President Trump, this day, is issuing an executive order that will make it easier to protect yourselves and your communities. He is rescinding restrictions from the prior administration that had limited your agency&#8217;s ability to get equipment through federal programs, including lifesaving gear.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> To discuss all of this, I&#8217;m joined by my colleague at The Intercept, Alice Speri. Her most recent piece, which we&#8217;re also going to discuss, is called, &#8220;Israel Security Forces Are Training American Cops Despite History of Rights Abuses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alice, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alice Speri:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So let&#8217;s begin with the very big picture here: explain the roots of the 1033 program and what it is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> The 1033 program has actually been around for many years. It was signed into law by President Clinton in the 90s, but it&#8217;s really been talked about more recently and specifically in the aftermath of the Ferguson protests. Basically this is a Pentagon program by which police departments across the country can buy excess supplies from the military, including grenade launchers and armored vehicles. And we really saw a lot of that equipment in Ferguson and in following protests against police brutality from 2014 onwards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audio from Ferguson protests]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Then, so in 2015, President Obama actually signed restrictions into place so that not all police departments would be able to get as much material. That was really one of the programs that was key to the militarization of police departments. And, of course, president Trump is, you know, in his effort to undo many of the efforts of police reform, really president Obama hasn&#8217;t done a whole lot of police reform, but there were programs put in place that Trump has very promptly rescinded, and the 1033 is one of them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;ve seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there&#8217;s an occupying force, as opposed to a force that&#8217;s part of the community that&#8217;s protecting them and serving them. Can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message. So we&#8217;re going to prohibit some equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How widespread is the transfer of this kind of equipment to state or local law enforcement agencies?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> It was pretty massive, you&#8217;ve seen departments across the country, not just the big cities, but really everywhere. And you see that these SWAT teams coming in, you know, with full body armor and full military equipment in small towns on drug raids. And that, which some of that has been exposed in recent years. There&#8217;s also been a few incidents in which you know, like, full SWAT teams would break into somebody&#8217;s home looking for a presumed drug dealer, and just finding kids and grandmothers and, you know, shooting up the place. So like, there has been some attention brought to the programs, it&#8217;s really, they&#8217;ve really made it across the country to all police departments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audio of police raid]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s really interesting to see how, particularly in the post-9/11 world, the United States has all of their new toys and weapons of war. And we&#8217;ve seen this increased use of technologies that were developed by the CIA or the Defense Department, used for surveillance of people that were determined to be terrorists or terror suspects, like Stingrays and other surveillance gear that&#8217;s being used to go after so-called common criminals. And this is a pretty ominous development because of the U.S. role in the world, because of the leading edge of technology that the U.S. finds itself at with the weapons of war and surveillance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now it&#8217;s being used in everyday drug busts, but also increasingly to face down against nonviolent protesters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Yes. Absolutely. That&#8217;s actually where we&#8217;ve seen most of this, and this is how a lot of the attention was brought to these programs. In Ferguson, we saw armored vehicles coming through the suburbs of St. Louis, and since then, we&#8217;ve seen that repeated, that scene repeated in Baltimore and Chicago in other cities across the country. Not always big cities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Of course, during the conventions there&#8217;s always a big fear that, you know, police will show up, as they have in the past with full military gear. And for instance, I covered the Republican convention in Cleveland where there really, ultimately weren&#8217;t that many protesters. But the city was on lockdown and police were armed as if they were going to war, so that&#8217;s very much the image they&#8217;re putting out there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I remember when I was starting off in journalism; I was in Seattle in 1999, for the World Trade Organization meetings where there was this huge uprising. And there I think was the first time that a new generation of activists faced down against this, it&#8217;s not even paramilitarization, really, it’s the militarization of the police.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so what Trump is doing right now is basically saying, &#8220;Ok, they put a little bit too short of a leash on this program, let&#8217;s just take the leash off completely.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Mhmm. And it&#8217;s very important to notice, you know, the militarization of police is not a partisan issue in any way, it&#8217;s not that Democrats really ever opposed it. And that&#8217;s why, when I talk about President Obama&#8217;s reforms on policing, I always say, those are very limited, very belated reforms that he was able to pass. They really just kind of began to tackle the issue, but they weren&#8217;t nearly sufficient and, you know, Trump rescinding many of them is predictable, but—\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But, see, if you get a job at one of these, like, venture capital firms or hedge funds that Obama is getting paid a half a million dollars to speak at, maybe you could ask him a question about that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;ll try!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s turn to this really fascinating story that you published at The Intercept. I think for a lot of people in this country, they would have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about. Israeli security forces training American cops? What does Israel have to do with local policing in the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Well, Israelis are actually training local police and private security forces all over the world, that&#8217;s really one of their, one of the big businesses. But what&#8217;s so fascinating to me about this story is that it&#8217;s been on my radar at least for a decade, if not more. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not a secret by any means, I mean these trips are advertised on the websites of the groups that sponsor them. And yet it is never talked about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s really fascinating to me that, even now, that we have so much attention on police departments in the US, on the militarization of police, the fact that these officers, and we&#8217;re talking about hundreds of them, are going to Israel yearly to train with military forces there, is just not talked about, and I think that&#8217;s quite fascinating.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean I first encountered Israeli private security in 2005 when I was in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. There was a firm called Instinctive Shooting International, ISI, that was hired to guard a wealthy, white enclave in New Orleans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And when I was researching at that time, I was sort of stunned to see how deeply embedded Israeli firms are in every level of the U.S. Homeland Security apparatus, in terms of training, and also the national security apparatus. That to me I think is one of the most disturbing aspects of this. That Israel is viewed in the world as one of the most efficient assassins that exists on the international scene, and now they&#8217;re increasingly working with American police forces armed with what are clearly weapons of war, not policing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Right, you think American cops don&#8217;t need any further militarizing, but I guess you can always get better at killing, I suppose. But no, I actually met Israeli security forces in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake there in 2010, so they&#8217;re everywhere. This is a huge business for Israel. It makes sense, right? When your entire country has gone through the military and everybody has military experience. That&#8217;s, you know, a great thing to have on your resume if you&#8217;re going to look to make money. That&#8217;s something you can market.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what&#8217;s really interesting is they&#8217;ve been able to market their experience in the occupied territories. And the occupation of Palestine has become this selling point, really, that&#8217;s put on brochures that sort of highlight Israel&#8217;s strength as a counterterrorism force. But when they train American cops on counterterrorism, a majority of what they&#8217;re teaching them ends up being used against civilians in the U.S. I mean, most police departments in the U.S. do not face serious terrorism threats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is an incredible part of your story, I just want to share this with our listeners. You write: “In the aftermath of 9/11, Israel seized on its decades-long experience as an occupying force to brand itself as a world leader in counterterrorism. U.S. law enforcement agencies took the Jewish state up on its expertise by participating in exchange programs sponsored by an array of pro-Israel groups, like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, and the Anti-Defamation League.&#8221; What on earth are those lobbying entities doing arranging counterterrorism, so-called counterterrorism training for U.S. police forces?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> I mean and I think perhaps the most ironic of them is the Anti-Defamation League, which really presents itself as a civil rights organization, that here in the U.S. counters, supposedly abusive policing, and they in the aftermath of Ferguson have been very strongly opposed to people that draw comparisons between the occupation of Palestine and, and the militarization of police in the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, a lot of people in Ferguson were sort of comparing themselves to Gaza, which is questionable in many ways, obviously, but, but there is definitely a solidarity that&#8217;s being built between occupied people in different ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right and you talked about in recent days, there was this delegation of top U.S. law enforcement officers, in Israel, for a seminar that was sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, it was a national counterterrorism seminar, topics such as leadership in a time of terror, balancing the fight against crime and terrorism, more than two hundred law enforcement executives from over one hundred departments in the U.S. participated in this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Having participated in this, since 2004 when it first launched, this week there were several top US officials, sometimes immigration enforcement agents also participate. Sometimes campus police participate in these trainings. They go to Israel and they learn from Israeli Police as well as the IDF, the Defense Forces military, as well as security forces that really work on border patrol.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think the most important thing to remember here is that these are U.S. cops that are tasked with enforcing civil law and criminal law here in the U.S., but they&#8217;re learning from people that are enforcing military rule over occupied people. So that the parallel is really quite interesting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean Israeli security forces operate in a non-democratic context and these are U.S. public servants that are learning those tactics, presumably to bring back and use against U.S. citizens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You specifically talk in your article about the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Commander Morgan Kane who attended the training. What did the D.C. police say to you when you reached out to them?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, so, well first of all, we only know about Morgan Kane, who&#8217;s a female commander actually in D.C., and she — we only know about this trip because Jewish Voices for Peace, which is one of the organizations that&#8217;s been exposing this, was able to find her name in a document they FOIA&#8217;ed. And so I reached out to the police department in DC, and basically they as many others really framed this trip as a counterterrorism opportunity. An opportunity for D.C. police to learn, you know, techniques that will keep DC residents and tourists safe. That&#8217;s really what they present.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Never mind that D.C. also has major problems, as many other cities do, with policing its own poor black brown citizens. It has a history of abuses, there have been a number of police killings there, as there have been in other cities. And so it&#8217;s really difficult to kind of draw a line and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m learning about counterterrorism and I&#8217;ll come back and not use it against everybody else and still police in a constitutional manner.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean these things really are connected. You can&#8217;t separate one from the other. There&#8217;s kind of this idea that counterterrorism is OK, but unconstitutional policing isn&#8217;t. And even on the counter terrorism front, I mean there&#8217;s plenty, obviously of abuse that comes out of these trips.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For instance the NYPD infamous Muslim spying program a few years back. That was pretty much modeled on the surveillance of Palestinians in the West Bank, and one of the officers, one of the top commanders actually in the NYPD, that was behind it, had participated in one of these trainings in Israel. So you really see these techniques and how these methods are brought back home and put in place against US citizens, in this case, Muslim citizens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But one other thing I would point out is that the exchange also goes both ways. I mean you think Israelis don&#8217;t have anything to learn from Americans in terms of oppressing populations, but they, they do. And one thing that, for instance, happened last year in Israel is that the government passed basically the equivalent of our stop and frisk law, which of course has been very much contested in a number of U.S. cities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Meanwhile, in Israel, this new law is essential to doing the same thing. And, of course, because the law itself is so vague, basically any officers can stop anyone they suspect of being up to something, essentially. That&#8217;s being applied very discriminately, and it&#8217;s, you know, with racism towards Palestinians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely a lot of cohesion between how the U.S. conducts itself in the world and how Israel conducts itself in Palestine, and increasingly we&#8217;re seeing those two merge in the U.S. And I wanted to get your analysis on, once again, the violence that we saw of the police in St. Louis in recent days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> I mean, I always feel like St. Louis is just a little bit ahead of the rest of the country in terms of finding out the flash points and really sort of showing you in a nutshell what policing and relationship between police and black and brown communities in this country is. As you know, I was in Ferguson three years ago. I&#8217;m kind of beginning to see to same thing happening again. I don&#8217;t know if you saw from people that were on the scene, there was a moment when after making a number of arrests, police reportedly started chanting:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Whose streets? Our streets!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Whose streets? Our streets!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Police shouting, &#8220;Whose streets? Our streets!&#8221;]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which is, of course, the protester anthem by default. And the fact that police would have really the arrogance and the nerve to chant this, in the streets, that they are supposed to serve, is just astounding to me. So really, St. Louis, I think captures this kind of conflict. St. Louis has, in the past, been an indicator of how these conflicts will play out. We&#8217;ll be watching, for sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alright, Alice Speri, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alice Speri is a reporter at The Intercept.

This week on Intercepted, physicist David Wright from the Union of Concerned Scientists discusses Donald Trump and the nuclear football and explains how easy it would be for Trump to launch a nuclear strike. We look back at the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, nearly 3,000 Americans — many of them immigrants, workers, dissidents — who tried to stop fascism in the 1930s before it spread in Europe. Professor James Fernandez of NYU explains why these volunteers didn’t just write their members of Congress or campaign for politicians. We speak with the directors of Death in the Terminal, a haunting new film about a terror attack in an Israeli bus station that leads to the brutal mob killing of an innocent Eritrean immigrant wrongly identified as a terrorist. And Donald Trump gets a visit from the two Bobs in his Office Space.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bob Slydell: \u003c/strong>Oh, there you are. Uh huh. Terrific. I&#8217;m Bob Slydell; this is my associate, Bob Porter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Anthony Ataminauk as Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> Hi, Bob, Bob.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Why don&#8217;t you go ahead and grab a seat and join us for a minute or two? You see, what we&#8217;re actually trying to do here, is we&#8217;re just, we&#8217;re trying to get a feel for how people spend their day at work. So, if you would, would you walk us through a typical day for you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS\u003c/strong>: Great.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA as DJT:\u003c/strong> Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late after watching TV and toilet tweeting. I use the side door, that way General Kelly can&#8217;t see me. And after that I just sort of space out for about an hour.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Uh! Space out?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I just stare at my desk, but it looks like I&#8217;m working. Sometimes I press my red button for a Diet Coke just to make sure it&#8217;s still there. And I do that for probably another hour after lunch, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then I say, I don&#8217;t know, in a given week I probably do about fifteen minutes of real actual work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Would you be a good sport and indulge us and just tell us a little more?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA:\u003c/strong> Oh yeah. Sure. Let me tell you something about this Twitter account, @fuctupmind. But it is not what you think. It is f-u-c-t…but we don&#8217;t sell a hat that big. You have to see it for yourself. Believe me. It&#8217;s just the best, it&#8217;s a MAGA hat on an actual train. But it doesn&#8217;t talk…\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The thing is, Bob, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m lazy, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t care.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t care?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA: \u003c/strong>It&#8217;s a problem of motivation, alright? Now if I work my ass off and read the Constitution and the presidential daily briefings — those are the worst, terrible, terrible ratings — I don&#8217;t see a golf course for days. So, where&#8217;s the motivation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And here&#8217;s another thing Bob: I have eight different personalities, right now!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Beg your pardon?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA: \u003c/strong>Eight of me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Eight?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA: \u003c/strong>Eight, Bob. So that means, when I make a mistake, I have eight different me’s coming to tell me whose fault it should be. That&#8217;s my real motivation. Is not to be hassled! That, and the fear of losing my hair, but you know Bob? It will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired. Believe me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Would you bear with me for just a second, please?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA: \u003c/strong>OK.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> What if, and believe me, this is a hypothetical, but what if you were offered some kind of a stock option, equity-sharing program. Would that do anything for you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AA: \u003c/strong>I don&#8217;t know. I guess. Listen I&#8217;m shorting America, creating subprime government. Listen I&#8217;m going to go golf, maybe put up a tweet about how unbelievable it would be to have another hurricane. Wasn&#8217;t that great? It broke all the records. Anyway, I hope you had a good time like the people in Texas, especially the blacks. Blacks love Trump, but the lying media won&#8217;t show you that. OK. Enjoy! It&#8217;s been really nice talking to you guys.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BS:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. The pleasure&#8217;s all on this side of the table. Trust me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill:\u003c/strong> This is Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City, and this is episode 29 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And it&#8217;s the most difficult job because it&#8217;s on the island, it&#8217;s on an island in the middle of the ocean. It&#8217;s out in the ocean. You can&#8217;t just drive you trucks there from other states.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Donald Trump has seemed to be totally unaware that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Unlike, say, the people of Texas and Florida. When Trump finally got around to acknowledging the horrible destruction that Hurricane Maria has wrought on the people of Puerto Rico, it was five days after the hurricane began its rampage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And when Trump did make a statement, it was, of course, on Twitter and he sounded like a heinous Wall Street asshole chastising a poor person for losing their home. This is what Trump tweeted: &#8220;Texas &amp; Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure &amp; massive debt, is in deep trouble&#8230;&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump couldn&#8217;t be bothered to talk about the destruction of Puerto Rico or the wellbeing of its 3.5 million people who are American citizens for five whole days. That&#8217;s because Trump was too busy obsessively using his presidential platform to attack other Americans — black athletes — and trying to get them fired because they&#8217;ve chosen to nonviolently protest the killing of black and brown people by police.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT: \u003c/strong>Wouldn&#8217;t you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, &#8220;Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He&#8217;s fired! He&#8217;s fired!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Trump&#8217;s attack, of course, was specifically aimed at Kaepernick and other black football players. Kaepernick&#8217;s mom responded to Trump by tweeting, &#8220;I guess that makes me a proud bitch.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump also had time to lie about NBA star Steph Curry of the NBA champions, the Golden State Warriors. Trump claimed that he was going to disinvite Steph Curry to the White House, you know, the championship teams get invited to the White House, but the thing is, Steph Curry had already said he wasn&#8217;t going to go to the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>NBA superstar LeBron James then tweeted at Trump saying: &#8220;U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain&#8217;t going! So therefore, ain&#8217;t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LeBron James:\u003c/strong> You bum! Me and my friends call each other that all the time. I&#8217;m not his friend, though. I don&#8217;t want to see that on the note. He&#8217;s not my friend. He doesn&#8217;t understand the power that he has for being a leader of this beautiful country. He doesn&#8217;t understand how many kids, no matter the race, look up to the president of the United States for guidance, for leadership, for words of encouragement. He doesn&#8217;t understand that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On Tuesday, at a brief press conference outside the White House, Donald Trump defended his obsession with black NFL players.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Well, I wasn&#8217;t preoccupied with the NFL, I was ashamed of what was taking place. Because to me that was a very important moment. I don&#8217;t think you can disrespect our country, our flag, our national anthem. To me the NFL situation is a very important situation, I&#8217;ve heard that before, about, &#8220;Was I preoccupied?&#8221; Not at all. Not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work. And, to be honest with you, that&#8217;s an important function of working. It&#8217;s called respect for our country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, let&#8217;s contrast Donald Trump&#8217;s words — and calling black athletes “sons of bitches” — and how Trump speaks about race and free expression with the words and the sentiments of the coach of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team Gregg Popovich.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gregg\u003c/strong> \u003cstrong>Popovich: \u003c/strong>You know whether it&#8217;s LGBT movement, or, you know, woman&#8217;s suffrage, race, it doesn&#8217;t matter, people have to be made to feel uncomfortable, and especially white people. Because we&#8217;re comfortable. We still have no clue of what being born white means.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump is using this moment as part of his culture war strategy. That this isn&#8217;t about respect for the flag. This is about race. This is about police killings of black people. This is about Trump wanting black people, particularly high-profile black people, to shut up, and just entertain us. And this is about a White House that has made clear that it&#8217;s fine with neo-Nazi marches and police killings, but wants protesting those very things outlawed sort of by proxy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump believes it should be mandatory for players in professional sports to stand for the flag or the national anthem. That&#8217;s the shit of dictators and despots. Trump doesn&#8217;t really believe in free speech. I honestly don&#8217;t even think Trump is capable of correctly paraphrasing or characterizing what the First Amendment says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But let&#8217;s be clear—this isn&#8217;t really about free speech. This is about racism. This is about police killings. This is about a White House that has set a tone on race that is being openly celebrated by vile fascists and racists. We all need to be vigilant in not falling into the Trump trap of changing the narrative or making this about supporting the troops. Because it&#8217;s not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We are totally prepared for the second option, not a preferred option, but if we take that option it will be devastating — I can tell you that — devastating for North Korea. That&#8217;s called the military option. If we have to take it, we will. He&#8217;s acting very badly. He&#8217;s saying things that should never ever be said. And we&#8217;re replying to those things, but it&#8217;s a reply. It&#8217;s not an original statement, it&#8217;s a reply.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, while Trump continues to attack black athletes he is simultaneously pulling the United States and the world closer and closer to the terrifying possibility of a war involving nuclear weapons. A war involving North Korea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump has said he would consider &#8220;totally destroying North Korea,&#8221; a nation of 25 million people. Kim Jong-un&#8217;s government says it has interpreted Trump&#8217;s recent statements about North Korea as a declaration of war. North Korea has threatened to detonate a hydrogen bomb in response to the threats from Trump and to shoot down U.S. warplanes. Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and Kim called Trump a dotard. None of the North Korean reaction or counter threats are surprising, but it is hard not to view Trump as erratic, manic, and, frankly, dangerous, particularly when you consider the vast nuclear arsenal at Trump&#8217;s fingertips. Now, during the election, a lot of people talked about, &#8220;Oh, my God, what would happen if Trump had his, you know, finger on the nuclear button.” But what does it really mean?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, all of this got me to looking into how easy would it actually be for Trump to use a nuclear weapon. And the answer is that it would be unthinkably easy. Frighteningly easy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;m joined now by physicist David Wright. He is co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Global Security Program. David, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>David Wright:\u003c/strong> Nice to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is the current system for initiating a nuclear strike within the United States government? How does it work, who holds that authority, what oversight is there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> Surprisingly there&#8217;s less oversight and, it&#8217;s more streamlined than I think most people realize. Ultimate authority lies with the president of the United States. There are various pieces of the procedure that are put in place to make sure that it&#8217;s the person the President communicates to knows that it&#8217;s the president. And that kind of thing. But if you, if you strip out those sort of authentication steps, it basically comes down to the president talking to advisers, which he or she may or may or may not do, deciding to launch, choosing an option either from a prepared list of options that the military has put together, or developing a new one. And then calling what&#8217;s called the “War Room” or the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon, telling them what option he&#8217;s chosen. Telling them when he wants the launch to take place, and that&#8217;s basically it. the War Room then prepares a short message that&#8217;s sent out to bomber bases, missile bases and submarines. And, as long as they get the right authentication codes, their job is to launch the attack they&#8217;ve been told to launch.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gen. Ripper (Dr. Strangelove)\u003c/strong>: A decision is being made by the president and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon. And when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the Wing, there will be only one course of action open. Total commitment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know you mentioned that he may or may not talk to advisers, but when you boil it down to it, authority to use a nuclear weapon is solely held by the president of the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW: \u003c/strong>That&#8217;s right. And, in fact, there are no legal grounds for somebody else stopping an order that was made legally.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>J\u003cstrong>S: \u003c/strong>And is the president required to communicate with anyone in Congress before launching a nuclear weapon?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW: \u003c/strong>No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is the president required to confer with the secretary of defense about this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> No. I mean it&#8217;s assumed that the president would, but there&#8217;s no requirement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It sounds like what you&#8217;re saying is that if the president of the United States, if Donald Trump, decided that he wanted to use a nuclear weapon, that the only thing that could potentially stop it would be if individuals violated that order, and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not gonna do this.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And they would be breaking the law in doing that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And some people have argued that people would have to decide, do they think this was made by the proper processes and things like that but if they had no reason to believe that there was something wrong with the process, they would have no legal authority to do that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>There&#8217;s kind of this lore around what&#8217;s called the nuclear football. Maybe you can explain what the nuclear football is and what its current iteration looks like.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> The procedure I just described assumed that the president was able to communicate with the people that he needed to through secure channels. If he&#8217;s in the White House or the Pentagon, he can do that. If he&#8217;s out on the road, you need to find another way to do that, and so the football is basically a bag that weighs about forty-five pounds. It has secure communications equipment in it. It has a black book of options. And it has a card which is called the biscuit which has codes on it that allows the President to convince the person at the Pentagon he&#8217;s talking to that he is in fact the president who is sending this message.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, basically the idea behind the football is to allow the president to order a launch no matter where he is, and for that reason there has to be a military officer with him, essentially at all times, carrying this football.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So as Trump travels around when he&#8217;s at his golf courses or you know when he&#8217;s at a political rally calling NFL players &#8220;sons of bitches,&#8221; the nuclear football is somewhere not far away.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right. Not too long ago he was at Mar-a-Lago, at a dinner with some supporters, and people were taking selfies with the military officer who had the football. This really is always near him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Because of the hostile rhetoric emanating from Trump&#8217;s Twitter feed, as well as from Pyongyang, you know, we now have North Korea saying that they view Trump statements of late as a declaration of war and they&#8217;re asserting the right to shoot down U.S. war aircraft, you know, for the first time in the lives of young people, they have to face this notion that we live in a nuclear world in a much more real way than we did, say, you know, four or five years ago. What does it mean when nuclear weapons are on hair-trigger alert.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> There are basically two ways that people talk about a nuclear war starting. One is if the president decided to launch a first strike, first use of nuclear weapons. The other case is where there is warning of an attack coming in from another country and the United States through its early warning sensors, its radars and its satellites, detects what they see as an incoming attack, and then the idea is to be able to get a retaliatory attack off the ground in a very short amount of time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This was really set up at a time when the U.S. and Russia were facing off, back in the early days of the Cold War. There was a concern that what the United States relied on for deterrence at that point was its land-based missiles, and that its land-based missiles were potentially vulnerable to a Soviet attack because the Soviets knew where they were. And so, the idea was that if you saw an attack coming in you didn&#8217;t want to sit and wait until those warheads landed because it could knock out your missiles, and therefore they set up a very streamlined process of launching a retaliatory attack to get the missiles off the ground before the incoming missiles could land.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That is still the situation that about 900 U.S. warheads are on. U.S. has currently about 1,800 nuclear warheads, so about half of them are on hair-trigger alert. And what that means is that within the sort of half an hour that it would take for a Russian launch, for example, to reach the United States, that a U.S. attack could be launched and sent back on its way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, so, the problem with that is that you&#8217;re relying on warning of an attack from sensors from radars and satellites and there have over the years been any number of times, when those systems have given false warning or there&#8217;s been a problem in some cases with the people in the loop, when people have thought that there was a launch and started to prepare for retaliation and when it turned out there wasn&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There was that film with Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, Crimson Tide, and the plot of it basically is that the commander and the XO on this submarine are on hair-trigger alert and there&#8217;s instability in Russia and communications get blocked and they don&#8217;t know whether or not they&#8217;re in a drill or they actually have been given the authority to use a nuclear weapon.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gene Hackman as Ramsey (Crimson Tide):\u003c/strong> Cob, arrest this man and get him out of here!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Denzel Washington as Hunter (Crimson Tide):\u003c/strong> &#8230; the operating procedures governing the release of nuclear weapons, we cannot launch our missiles unless both you and I agree.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GH: \u003c/strong>Cob, what are you waiting for?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> This is expressly why your command must be repeated. It requires my assent. I do not give it. And furthermore, you continue upon this course, and insist upon this launch without confirming this message first, I will be forced, backed by the rules of precedence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GH:\u003c/strong> As Captain, commander of the USS Alabama, I order you to place the XO on your —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> Major regulations —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GH:\u003c/strong> I order you to place the XO under arrest under charge of mutiny.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s the kind of scenario you&#8217;re talking about where maybe it is, maybe it isn&#8217;t and you have to make a decision on it very quickly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> Well that&#8217;s right. I mean one of the classic scenarios was the Pentagon has a room where they monitor all the early warning systems. And back in 1979, all of a sudden it lit up basically saying that a full-scale Soviet Attack, just like the ones they had practiced against, was underway. People checked and rechecked and all the data that was coming into the computers, you know, was perfect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At that point they got a hold of various people at the Pentagon, tried to make sure they knew what they were doing, and they were just about to what wake up the president, to, you know, tell the president that there was incoming, large-scale Soviet attack, when somebody realized that there was a training tape, the command centers that was being run, and somehow the data from that training tape had gotten into the operational computers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, in fact, it looked like just the kind of attack that people had had trained against because in fact it was, it was a training tape.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As I understand it, to this day, nobody really understands how that information got from the training tape computer to the actual operational computers, but that was a case where if you think about the very short amount of time that you&#8217;ve got — I mean again, you&#8217;re talking about less than a half an hour that&#8217;s trying to make sense of the data that&#8217;s coming in, getting the people together to talk about what it means, get ahold of the president, get the president briefed and all that kind of thing — there&#8217;s very little time to make a decision. And that&#8217;s a case where, you know, you could have imagined, based on that, that the United States would have launched a very large retaliatory strike.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What would be the case if senior people at the White House or in Congress questioned the mental stability of the commander-in-chief — maybe he&#8217;s acting very erratic, he is watching a lot of TV, he&#8217;s arguing with strangers on the internet, he doesn&#8217;t seem to be weighing in on important issues of the day, doesn&#8217;t seem interested in reading his intelligence reports, you know, generally acting kind of nuts while in the White House — has that ever happened before, where there&#8217;s been a discussion about “hmm maybe the president&#8217;s not of sound mind?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> Well, in fact, it did happen, late in the Nixon administration Nixon was depressed from the Watergate hearings, he was apparently drinking heavily. And people in the White House, in particular, Secretary of Defense Schlesinger, was concerned about his mental state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Nixon (in the Nixon Tapes): \u003c/strong>The nuclear bomb. Does that bother you? I just want you to think big, Henry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> And told people at the Pentagon, &#8220;If you get a launch order or something like that from the President, I want you to check with me before you carry it out.&#8221; That was extra-legal, that was not something that he was actually allowed to do, but I think there was a sense that this was an extraordinary time and that it was probably justified\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, it&#8217;s a question of personalities then. How do you decide when that is justified, and how do you decide whether, if you are a launch officer who is well down on the chain of command, what command will you follow? The one from the president or somebody trying to contravene that order?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you make of the way that Trump and Kim Jong-un are sort of duking it out on social media and, you know, with this sort of name calling rhetoric. It&#8217;s like, insane, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> I would say insane is pretty good word for that. I have to say, it&#8217;s just incredibly disturbing that when you&#8217;re talking about having tens of thousands of lives, especially in South Korea, at risk if something happens. I mean as I think people have probably heard in the press, that if there is something that happens on the Korean Peninsula, for example, if the United States decides to try and launch an attack, say a conventional attack to take out bunkers or things like, that North Korea has a very large number of artillery tubes that are aimed at Seoul, which is, as you know, unfortunately quite close to the border between North and South Korea. And then in a very short amount of time, that could cause huge amounts of damage to South Korea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, from my point of view, having watched North Korea for a long time, I&#8217;m concerned that as, as people let their personality get into this, and start to see these things as personal affronts, and start making, you know, drawing red lines and backing themselves into corners, what they really start to do is reduce the number of options they have for moving forward. And I think that that&#8217;s what I see is the real tragedy of the current situation, is I think both President Trump and Kim Jong Un have made some very strong statements that it&#8217;s going to take a lot to get them to walk away from.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yet the consequences of sort of taking, you know, step by step going forward in the direction it&#8217;s going is incredibly dangerous. When Kim Jong Un came out a couple days ago and basically made some very strong statements, one of the concerns is that what that essentially did, I think, is undercut any sort of quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy. Because when Kim Jong Un comes out and says, you know, &#8220;We can&#8217;t talk with this country that&#8217;s essentially declared war on us,&#8221; any kind of officials under Kim Jong Un who are trying to carry out some sort of, you know, behind-the-scenes dialogue, puts them in a position of having to sort of cut those off if they&#8217;re going to follow official position.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And once that happens, I don&#8217;t see what means you have to try and walk yourself back from the situation. I&#8217;ve watched North Korea for 25 years and I&#8217;ve never been as worried as I am now about what may happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> David Wright, thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DW:\u003c/strong> Very nice to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> David Wright is the co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists&#8217; Global Security Program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now. before we go on with the show, I just want to give people a quick update on the alleged whistleblower Reality Winner. She, of course, is in jail right now facing charges under the Espionage Act. The government claims that she was the source of a report that was published by The Intercept, NSA top secret document that dealt with Russian cyber-espionage efforts in the 2016 presidential election. Winner is being held without bond, and part of the reason that the judge agreed to hold her without bond is that the U.S. Attorney claimed in court that the government had recorded Reality Winner while she was in jail saying that she had “documents,” plural, and that the concern was that she may have other documents and if she&#8217;s free she might be able to share those as well or leak those as well. And they also claim that they overheard her directing the transfer of $30,000 from her savings account to her mom&#8217;s account, because she wanted to have free legal counsel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, now, the U.S. Attorney is saying that she has listened to the tapes before she was just going off of the FBI&#8217;s characterization of them, and says that Winner doesn&#8217;t say anything about documents, but that it&#8217;s “document” singular. And, as for the $30,000 wire transfer, the U.S. Attorney is now saying, well, Reality Winner was concerned that her bank account was going to be frozen, and that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay for a lawyer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it seems very clear here that the FBI misled the U.S. Attorney in that case to keep Reality Winner in jail without bond. This deserves more investigation and more attention.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;A Toast to Those Who Are Gone Lyrics&#8221; by Phil Ochs]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was the late folk singer Phil Ochs singing &#8220;A Toast to Those Who Are Gone,&#8221; specifically a verse about what is now an almost never discussed episode in American history and that is the story of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 1936, young Americans began heading over to Spain to confront the rise of fascism in Europe. At the time, Spain was viewed in the world as an early front line in the battle against fascism in Europe. And those Americans who operated under the banner of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade joined volunteers from across the globe who also came to Spain to fight against fascist forces, led by General Francisco Franco.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Franco was a murderous thug and an ally of Mussolini and Hitler. And eventually, Franco would become a great ally of the United States government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, while the story of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade is not often told or recalled in the modern era, it should be. It&#8217;s the story of young Americans, many of them immigrants, laborers, workers, who saw the dangers of fascism years before the United States government got militarily involved in war against Hitler and his allies, and well before the point where the mythical history of the fight against fascism in Europe is taught in many American schools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On Tuesday, Donald Trump held a joint press conference with the Spanish prime minister. The timing of that is interesting given that the Spanish government is, at this very moment, forcefully seeking to stop a referendum on independence in Catalonia. Donald Trump made clear where he stands on this issue:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to, because you&#8217;re talking about staying with a truly great, beautiful, and very historic country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now it&#8217;s interesting that while Trump uses his generic filler for countries he doesn&#8217;t know much about— “oh it&#8217;s great, historic, beautiful” — the U.S. relationship with Spain for many decades was one of normalizing the dictatorship of General Franco.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I doubt Trump knows much of anything about Franco, but I&#8217;m certain that Trump would have loved the dictator who ruled Spain until his death in 1975. You see, Franco&#8217;s whole agenda was framed around making Spain great again: shielding Spain from foreign influence, preserving its conservative brand of religion, fascism masquerading as proud nationalism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s a lot of debate and discussion today over the tactics of the groups and people that are generically referred to as Antifa, and it&#8217;s become a regular talking point including of Democrats and some liberal pundits to kind of equate Antifa, with the so-called alt-right, or with the neo-Nazis and white supremacists being more and more empowered by the Trump Administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This both sides are wrong mentality has been used throughout history to forgive the crimes of right-wing fascist movements. The veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were celebrated initially as heroes and visionaries who saw the threat of fascism early on and tried to stop it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And today, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade is seldom mentioned at all. This history is actually vital for all of us to study, particularly in this moment that we currently find ourselves in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We&#8217;re joined now by James Fernandez. He&#8217;s a professor of Spanish and Portuguese at New York University and he is on the board of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archive. Jim, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jim Fernandez: \u003c/strong>Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, let&#8217;s start at the beginning. Give the political context of what was happening in Europe in the mid-1930s that ultimately spurred so many young people to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> In the case of Spain, 1931, Spain tries this experiment in democracy, which is really its first real experiment in modern democracy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>1936 Newsreel:\u003c/strong> But in Europe, monarchy fell. Turbulent Spain, ended the rule of the Bourbons and exiled her popular king, Alfonso, the unlucky 13th, becoming a Republic under President Zamora.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> And the country chooses the worst possible moment, because democracy and capitalism are being called into question all over the world. So, we&#8217;re in the throes of the Great Depression, it looks like liberal democracy has maybe reached the end of its course, these alternative ideologies are getting strength all across the ideological spectrum, and, in the context, fascism rises in Italy and Germany, and eventually with the coup that Franco and his generals unleashed on July 18, 1936 it raises its head in Spain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>1936 Newsreel: \u003c/strong>From our cameramen, in the vital Northeast sector of the Spanish warfront, comes news that is no less important than the attack on the Capital. But with the world&#8217;s spotlights on the fight around Madrid, they&#8217;re apt to forget that Catalonia and its capital, Barcelona, are by no means conquered. Day after day, along a 100-mile front, these men hold the lines against fierce attacks by the forces of Moors, used by General Franco’s main spearhead. But the line holds and here in the Northeast is the government&#8217;s main center of hope. Day after day, our cameraman face grim scenes. Day after day, they live to the tune of pinging bullets, of the throb of gunfire, of the roar of warplanes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> So, in the States, there were thousands and thousands of folks that were following very closely what was happening in Europe and in Spain. The horrors of World War II have totally eclipsed our memory of Spain. But in 1936, &#8217;37, &#8217;38, Spain was Syria, Spain was the place on the map where it looked like the future of the planet was being played out. And all thinking people were talking and thinking and worrying about Spain, in their literature and newsreels and radio broadcasts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there were vast communities of intensely mobilized folks that started mainly as pacifists they were, they were, &#8220;Against War and Fascism&#8221; was the organization and slogan of a lot of these folks up until &#8217;36, let&#8217;s say, but once things evolved some more, they realized that the only way to put down fascism was to, in this case, they kind of put brackets around being against war, and actually taking the war to the fascists in Spain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The volunteers that went is almost 3,000, we think 2,800 is our best guess now. And like I said, they came mostly from intensely mobilized communities all over the United States. A lot of them were immigrants or children of immigrants, most of them were from large cities, they were trade unionists, a lot of them were members of the Communist Party, the socialists, anarchists, but generally leftist folk who saw the menace of fascism and took the incredible step of trying to do something about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, what was the posture of the United States government at the time toward these fascist elements that were starting to quite rapidly rise in Europe, with Spain being the first major front?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Right, I mean the stance was pretty much wait and see. The story that we tell ourselves about the history of the United States is that we are this anti-fascist force, this force that put down fascism in the world, World War II.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, we have guys who in December of &#8217;36, December 26, 1936, a bunch of guys walked to Chelsea Piers and got on a ship to France and eventually crossed into Spain to put down fascism, a full five years before Pearl Harbor. In the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives we have the letters that they were writing back to their families. The clarity is unbelievable. Their clairvoyance of why they were going and what was there, and what it was that they were fighting is really amazing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And they knew exactly what they were going to fight against.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why would young Americans decide to actually leave the United States and go to Spain? Like, what was so important to them about what was happening in Spain that they would risk their lives to go and fight and potentially die there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Their reasons are diverse. And it&#8217;s interesting to see how a lot of them project on to Spain their own anxieties. So, for a lot of the Jewish volunteers, Spain was a shot at Hitler, directly. They might not have known anything about Spain, they supported the republic because it was the thing to do. But really Spain was a place for certain Jewish volunteers to defend their people and their lives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>African-Americans, it&#8217;s an amazing story, about 90 African-Americans volunteered to fight in Spain, and they, for the most part, saw fascism as an extension of Jim Crow, as an extension of institutional racism and white supremacy. And they say this very clearly in their letters\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And in fact, Langston Hughes, who, at the time, was writing for The Baltimore Afro-American, one of the great black newspapers from American history, he wrote, &#8220;Give Franco a hood and he&#8217;d be a member of the Ku Klux Klan.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s awesome. I hadn&#8217;t heard that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean obviously, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was a largely white population, as you point out. And it was the first actually integrated militarized unit in United States history. Why did they choose the name Abraham Lincoln Brigade?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> We don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s a standard explanation, which doesn&#8217;t satisfy me, which is basically that he was the president who presided over a nation that was in the midst of a Civil War. Other people say that along the lines of the Popular Front Strategy, the tendency was to try to name after national heroes. There was this attempt to claim that there&#8217;s nothing incompatible between, say, communism and Americanism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some people on the right say that it was a ruse, they were trying to trick people that these were dirty communists who just used this name to pass as something else. But that&#8217;s definitely not true. The reason I have doubts about it is because we recently found a photograph with volunteers with a banner with the name on it, which is earlier than any of the accounts that we know about, and it&#8217;s being held by a bunch of Cuban volunteers who had been in New York. So, we&#8217;re trying to figure that out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain who Franco was and the ideas that he was advocating when he essentially attempted to just put a complete halt to any kind of a democratic process in Spain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Franco was astute and shape changing and he was around for a long time and he rewrote himself many times. And so, he was a general who had been seasoned in Spain&#8217;s colonial wars in North Africa, putting down the Moroccan plea for independence from Spain. That accounts, in part, for his incredible brutality. And a lot of historians talk about how his army inflicted on Spaniards the kinds of torture and warfare that in the past had never been used in Europe, only on colonial peoples quote-unquote. And he basically carried out a campaign of annihilation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>1936 Newsreel:\u003c/strong> After a bullet-studded journey across the North of war-torn Spain, our cameraman reached the fight headquarters at Burgos. There, they succeed in getting a camera interview with General Franco, smiling, maybe, at the news of his victory in San Sebastian. With his troops seemingly moving forward on all fronts, there&#8217;s special significance in their leader&#8217;s statement that if they win the war, he&#8217;ll establish a military dictatorship, to last as long as is necessary to restore order.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> He wasn&#8217;t interested really at any point in truce and negotiation. He realized, especially once he had Hitler and Mussolini&#8217;s support, he realized that he could go for the whole enchilada and try to basically annihilate the people that were in Spain that were contaminated with this anti-Spanish zeal for democracy, is basically the way that he saw it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So the Republic was trying to take measures to bring Spain into modernity. Before the Republic education was in the hands of the Church, the land was largely in the hands of a small number of families, the Republic had the incredible task of not only trying to institute democratic institutions in the hostile climate of 1931-36, it also basically had to create Spanish citizens. Because there were no modern citizens in Spain in the 1930s, there were subjects of a monarchy; there were people who didn&#8217;t see themselves as stakeholders in any kind of common Republican process.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, the Republic is trying to build schools, do land reform, eventually put down a coup that later gets help from Hitler and Mussolini, and create a sense of belonging and stake holding among the Spanish citizens. That&#8217;s a tall order.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the U.S. posture toward Franco at the time?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> The official posture was one of nonintervention, and, in fact, an embargo on the sale of arms to either side in Spain was approved by Congress, which, of course, only favored the fascist side.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve heard it said that is the first and only time in American history where the United States has refused to sell arms to a legally elected democratic government with which it had diplomatic relations. But, no they decided, Roosevelt decided in Congress to declare neutrality and nonintervention, and, on top of that, to impose an embargo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Secretary of State Cordell Hull:\u003c/strong> The American government expressed the complete impartiality of its attitude, and that it&#8217;s public that they did that in conformity with the well-established policy of noninterference with internal affairs in other countries, either in times of peace, or in the event of civil strife, it will, of course, refrain from any interference whatsoever in the unfortunate Spanish situation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When the volunteers from the United States started to go to Spain, talk about that. Like, how did they get there, who were the first groups of people to go, and how many went initially?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> So the war starts in July of &#8217;36. Franco and his generals really thought that in a couple of weeks they could impose martial law, kind of reset the government, roll back some of the reforms, and just, they thought they were going to hit the reset button. But it didn&#8217;t turn out that way. There was incredible popular resistance, especially in the major cities, to the fascist uprising, so the thought that this might escalate into an international conflagration, I don&#8217;t think was on anybody&#8217;s mind.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>1936 Newsreel: \u003c/strong>Madrid takes to the barricades, as this fortnight of frantic combat drives Spain&#8217;s death tool well into the third 100,000, the capital&#8217;s stubborn defenders fortify all positions for the final climactic struggle. Everywhere is the evidence of the grim resolve never to surrender. Street banners proclaim they shall not pass. Men, women, and children, flaunting the determination to fight to a finish. Today they parade, tomorrow they may die.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> But by October of &#8217;36, the battle for Madrid is, they&#8217;re there, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be a longer war than anyone thought, Hitler and Mussolini were already helping Franco. The first Americans boarded a ship right after Christmas, December 26, &#8217;36, and got there about a week later. And the typical route from here was to take a ship to Paris, a train to southern France, and then, because the border was closed for most of the duration of the Spanish Civil War, most of the guys hiked across the Pyrenees at night, led by smugglers. Catalan or Basque smugglers who knew their way around the Pyrenees, lead into Spain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Did any of them have military experience or fighting experience?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Very few. Some did but most of them, no, there&#8217;s very little military experience. These guys were workers, factory workers, you know, union organizers, things like that that. Not much military training.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At the Abraham Lincoln Brigade archive, there&#8217;s a growing collection of letters that these individuals that joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade wrote during their time, or as they were going, or while they were there. Share some of the kinds of reasons that these people joined the Brigade and went to Spain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> What for me is one of the richest documents in all of the archive, which is a letter that James Lardner wrote to his mother. James Lardner was Harvard-educated correspondent for the International Tribune in Paris, and this guy had a good job in Paris and went to write a story about Spain, and fell in love with the cause. And against everyone&#8217;s advice, including his friends —Hemingway, and everybody else — very well-connected family, he enlisted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we have the letter that he wrote to his mom, as she received this letter from her son that she thinks is in an office in Paris typing out stories, and he says, &#8220;Mom I&#8217;ve decided to go to Spain, and for my own edification I&#8217;ve made a list, in no particular order.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then the list is like 22 or 24 items. And it&#8217;s a gem because he&#8217;ll say things like, &#8220;Well my French is pretty good, but I need to improve my Spanish.&#8221; Or he says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a girl in Paris who needs to realize that she can live without me.&#8221; But then he says, &#8220;Because I feel that in modern times, war is one of the things, unfortunately that all of us need to prepare for. And I intend to do that. And that fascism needs to be put down.&#8221; And he says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to replace it, maybe it&#8217;s communism, I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221; And then he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of wearing a tie.&#8221; It&#8217;s a beautiful text because it shows the complex motivations of a single person.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But he was a blue blood, and there were some like him, but the vast majority, like I said before, were working class ethnics who were going to put down what they saw as a planetary menace.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When they arrived, who did they report to? Like how does one just go to a place where there&#8217;s a rise of fascism and even know where to go?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> The Communist Party took care of the logistics. Here, they helped to get the passports and book the tickets. Because they were travelling illegally right? Their passports were stamped, &#8220;Not Valid for Travel in Spain.&#8221; That&#8217;s how important Spain was, it was an actual rubber stamp on your passport.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They were OK, because they were taking a ship to Paris, right, and then they would figure out how to get into Spain with the help of the, of the Communist Party of France.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And when they finally make it through France and enter Spain, how does the involvement of the Brigade begin in terms of actual fighting or assisting others in the rebellion against Franco?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Well they&#8217;re quickly organized into a battalion, eventually a few battalions, so technically the Abraham Lincoln Brigade is a, is a misnomer, there was never such a thing. There was an Abraham Lincoln Battalion and a George Washington battalion and then a third battalion that was Mackenzie–Papineau, that was mixed Canadian and American. But we use the brigade term to refer to all of them. They were organized into battalions, and with very little training, they were thrown into the first battle, was the battle of Jarama, which is on the outskirts of Madrid and it was a struggle to keep open the road between Madrid and Valencia, which was going to be the supply line for the Republic for most of the war, for the Mediterranean.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Jarama Valley&#8221; by Woodie Guthrie plays]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was the fate of some of the people that ended up going to Spain? Like maybe you could just give some examples of kind of the experience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> On the whole, it was pretty terrible, because they were used as shock troops and because they were not as well equipped as they should have been and they certainly didn&#8217;t have the experience and training that they should have had. So, the actual combat experience was pretty harsh and awful. Especially the first battles: they were they were decimated in Jarama, and they had morale problems because of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But they stuck it out and we think that of the 2,800, probably a third are in Spanish soil, died there. And then another third came back and go off the radar. We don&#8217;t really have much of a beat on them. The other third are people who kind of made their experience in Spain a centerpiece of their life in one way or another. And we know an awful lot about those guys. But there&#8217;s two-thirds that kind of escaped us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> By no means was it just people from the United States coming to join. I mean, you had people from all over the world. Maybe you can describe how Spain then became this, it was like flypaper for people who were gravitating to the anti-fascist struggle that was emerging in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right. Yeah. The International Brigades we think was made up of about 45,000 volunteers, so the Americans were a drop in the bucket. The most amazing statistic I&#8217;ve heard is that a thousand Cubans were there. I think 3,000 Americans, and 1,000 Cubans —a tiny country, I don&#8217;t know what the population of Cuba was in &#8217;36, but it&#8217;s a small country. France probably contributed the most volunteers, Germany — there were a lot of people who were already political exiles, kind of stateless people, that went to Spain because they wanted to fight against fascism and they couldn&#8217;t live in Italy, or Germany.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And you also had people that would become very serious literary figures. I&#8217;m thinking of &#8220;Homage to Catalonia&#8221; by George Orwell, and, of course, Hemingway was on the scene. What was the experience of some of those people that ended up becoming very famous or already had something of a reputation versus the working class, rank-and-file labor guys who went over from the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> I know that Hemingway is a fascinating case, right? Because he comes back and writes what is billed as the great American novel about the Spanish Civil War. And it is a great novel. But it drove the veterans crazy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The volunteers emerged out of immigrant, working class communities that were deeply mobilized. Hardly any of them was a loner. Hardly any of them was a professor of Spanish, hardly any of them had a name like Robert Jordan. These guys were Fishman, and Pekowski, and Fernandez and things like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, he writes this great American novel about the Spanish Civil War and his hero is this loner WASP who&#8217;s there for unknown reasons, and who speaks Spanish, and who&#8217;s just — I think eventually the veterans came to think, well, maybe his heart was in the right place, but he kind of did us a disservice by portraying, you know, the American volunteer in world literature is this guy Robert Jordan who doesn&#8217;t really look like most of the volunteers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gary Cooper as Robert Jordan (For Whom the Bell Tolls):\u003c/strong> You have to understand Maria, I&#8217;m in this war to the finish. I can&#8217;t have anything serious in my life. A man doing what I&#8217;m doing never knows what&#8217;s going to happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ingrid Bergman as Maria (For Whom The Bell Tolls):\u003c/strong> Whatever happens to you, will happen to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How were the battalions covered in the media in the United States at the time?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Until the Cold War heats up, they were seen as anti-fascist heroes.

Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine (Casablanca):\u003c/strong> And got well paid for it on both occasions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CR:\u003c/strong> The winning side would&#8217;ve paid you much better.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HB:\u003c/strong> Maybe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CR:\u003c/strong> Aha!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> So, here&#8217;s a Hollywood film from, I guess it&#8217;s 1942, where having been in Spain is credentials for knowing how to do the right thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That then starts to change, though, as World War II comes to an end and you had volunteers that were targeted by the government, particularly through the lens of the House on American Activities Committee and anti-communist, kind of, fever that was sparked in the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Yeah that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really amazing. And again, the Archive is so valuable because we can see that happen in time. Right, these people go from being seen as anti-fascists, being on the on the right side of history, for that moment, to being subversive communists that need to be surveilled and persecuted. And it happens in the span of years. And it happens right before your eyes, you know, if you follow the papers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to ask your thoughts on the debate over what is generically being called right now Antifa in the United States. And, you know, part of it centers around the clashes with neo-Nazi fascist elements that are trying to defend Confederate monuments. And, of course, we have incidents like the murder of Heather Heyer where, you know, this guy runs her over in a car. Or the beating of Deandre Harris by these, you know, neo-Nazis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But there is this trend of you know responsible progressives, Democrats, that sort of view Antifa as just this uncouth group of troublemakers that are going to ruin it for the rest of us that are trying to responsibly confront the realities of a Trump-governed United States. What are your thoughts, though, about this discussion, and the punching of Nazis that&#8217;s become a meme, and the way that Antifa is sort of equated with neo-Nazis, including by self-identified Democrats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In a lot of ways, it&#8217;s funny to see this happening in the, States because that&#8217;s precisely the image that Franco and his regime eventually promoted of the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish Civil War was the result of these two brutal and excessive forces going at it, and it&#8217;s best to just do everything we can to make sure that never happens again on both sides. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, Spain has pretty much done this already this kind of cleansing of history so that it looks like it was this moment of collective craziness that led to this bloodletting that we&#8217;ve happily now overcome. And that&#8217;s what I see at the bottom of the rhetoric here, of equating these two sides and saying, &#8220;Oh no, you know, they&#8217;re both, they&#8217;re equally, they&#8217;re good guys on both sides.&#8221; Or whatever, however you want to put it. It&#8217;s a way of disarming history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Given your scholarship on Spain, I&#8217;m wondering if you sense whiffs of Franco in Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> I recently showed a different class that I teach, a photograph that was taken at a right-wing rally in Spain. I think was right after Trump was elected and there was a guy, a Spanish guy in this big rally, holding up a sign in English that says, &#8220;Make Spain Great Again.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Wow!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Kind of sums it up. Where is the Spain that he wants to go back to, right? And the first answer is this, the Spain of a dictatorship, and the second answer, a longer take, is Imperial Spain, when, you know, Spain ruled the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was sort of Franco&#8217;s argument with the people about why what he was doing was right? Like what was his sort of promise to Spain as he sought to stop any kind of a democratic movement in Spain and take power himself? Like, what was the core argument he was making to average Spaniards?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> The core argument was that Spain had been infected with this foreign ideology — part of Spain, the part that sided with the Republic — that there was an anti-Spain living within Spain. That people had been infected with the virus of disorder and communism and all of that, and he promised to return to law and order and to return to this Spanish essence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which means what?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> Oh, inequality, Catholicism, pride in a kind of invented imperial past. Law and order.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It sounds so familiar, and so, now I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, but it sounds so familiar to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> For this generation of young people in the United States, what do you think is the historical lesson to take away from the history of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JF:\u003c/strong> It can&#8217;t be a lesson in what to do when, because people really have to reach that decision on their own. But here&#8217;s a historical example — a shining historical example — right, of a world kind of a drift, and some people who realize that some lines have been crossed and actually, OK, it&#8217;s time now to abandon pacifism and to do something else. When do you cross that line? That&#8217;s the thing. Nobody can be sure it&#8217;s time. And that&#8217;s the scary thing, that&#8217;s the terrifying thing really of living in times like these. You know? There&#8217;s a t-shirt you see once in a while that says, &#8220;Is it fascism yet?&#8221; It&#8217;s not like fascism is going to arrive on a steed. We&#8217;re going to drift into it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Who are going to be the people who are going to say, &#8220;You know what? We&#8217;ve drifted too far. And normal tactics and normal institutions might not be able to get us out of this.&#8221; When does that happen?

A gunman killed a soldier and injured ten civilians. Of course, violent incidents like this aren&#8217;t uncommon in Israel. In that year alone, there were a number of similar attacks. But there was one unusual thing about this one. In the midst of the chaos, a security guard shot a man that he believed was one of the attackers in the bus terminal. And after the man was shot and on the ground bleeding out, a crowd formed around him and started beating him repeatedly: shouting, cursing him, throwing a chair on his head.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Meanwhile, the actual gunman was at the other end of the station. It turned out that this man who was beaten for 20 minutes as he lay bleeding on the floor was innocent. He was an Eritrean immigrant by the name of Habtom Zarhum, and he died after being shot and gang beaten by security forces and Israeli civilians alike.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is the subject of a haunting documentary called Death in the Terminal. It has just been released in the US, and you can stream the whole movie for free at Topic.com. That&#8217;s a new media platform just launched by First Look Media.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This film, Death in the Terminal, combines the raw surveillance footage and eyewitness interviews with people who you actually see also in the footage, in an effort to reconstruct what happened that day in the Be’er Sheva bus terminal.

We were at home, it was 7 o&#8217;clock in the evening, the children were off to, you know, bath and were watching TV and, you know, putting on the pajamas. And, then there were breaking news on the television and suddenly pictures started coming from Be’er Sheva bus terminal and the news were saying there was a terror attack. And we were at home with the children and said, &#8220;Whoa, what&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; And actually, it happened live, so and we saw the whole thing live. And we started seeing pictures of the terrorist, assumed terrorist, being held inside the bus terminal, and people started sending clips from their iPhones, from the cellular phones, that the crowd is beating one of the terrorists.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And they started broadcasting this footage, and I was at home with the children and I was shocked, I started taking out the children. And I called Asaf, I told him, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here? Look!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we understood, like everyone else, you know, it was still going on, the terror attack. Inside there were shootings, but reporters were standing outside the terminal and broadcasting from outside. And saying there was two terrorists inside, maybe three, and we hear gunshots and here we get this footage from the inside and they catch one of the terrorists, and they started showing this terrible footage of the beating, you know, beating a man in the ground. 22 minutes, he&#8217;s lying there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> For people who haven&#8217;t seen this film yet, explain to people what happens during those 22 minutes? Like basically, walk us through what happened that day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Well, the moment you hear the shots, it&#8217;s echoing in a really cruel way. And immediately you see a stream of people shouting and running all directions, and seconds after the first gunshots, you see the security guard coming into the frame and shooting a black guy. The black guy is coming, the Eritrean citizen is coming —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> He’s running away.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s running away from outside, inside, because he doesn&#8217;t know where the shot&#8217;s coming from.

He&#8217;s being shot by the security guard of the bus terminal and it&#8217;s taking second so you don&#8217;t actually digest what you&#8217;re seeing, so!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do we know why the security guard believed that Habtom Zarhum was the terrorist?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Well, I think this is, you know, this is part of the experience we wanted their viewers to go through. At first, no orientation, really the information really coming fast. Your eyes are busy, you know, watching people running. And suddenly you see this action, you know, of someone taking out a gun and you don&#8217;t, and you&#8217;re sure. He is the terrorist? Did he do something? Did he pull out a gun? You&#8217;re not sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then when you watching it again, you see there is nothing. He&#8217;s just running out, inside, and, he&#8217;s, the security guard, watching him, seeing him, and immediately taking out the gun and shooting him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> It was in an instinct I think, he just, it was just two seconds, he just shot him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> But there were a lot of people running.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, yeah. Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> And he shot him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> And he shot him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And so, he&#8217;s shot by the security guard, he&#8217;s on the ground, and then —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> And then immediately, you see a few more guys with rifles coming again and pointing at him. From this second on, he is the terrorist and you have to remember there&#8217;s more shots being shot simultaneously, because the real terrorist is —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s not there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s not there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> A couple of feet —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s near the restroom. The story is immediately in people&#8217;s head: there is two terrorists. We caught one, we neutralized one. And there is the second one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, you interviewed several people who were part of the incident that day and one interesting character in your film is this young man who actually intervenes to try to stop people from attacking someone that he also believes is a terrorist. So, he, it&#8217;s not that he was saying, &#8220;Hey, you have the wrong man here.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Talk about who that young man is and what his perspective was that day and why he tried to stop other people from attacking this Eritrean man as he lay bleeding on the ground?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Well, Moshe Kochavi. This guy served in Israeli Special Forces, is a really like a hard core military soldier. And he&#8217;s coming from a religious family. And special kind of family, really into contributing to community, really into a socialism and living in a commune, he had this education from really being from, young boy, as an idealist, actually.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You see, his action is also, one, as an instinct, one optional way to take action.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Describe what he did when the beating of this Eritrean man begins?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS: \u003c/strong>Well, actually trying to stop it. You know, he was trying to stop people. And people were furious. &#8220;You&#8217;re betraying us. You&#8217;re protecting the killer.&#8221; And you have to be really strong to stand against a crowd.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s risking, he&#8217;s risking his life. He could be outside. He&#8217;s risking his life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Being hurt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> By protecting Habtom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Could be hurt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Actually, takes beating, and people pushing him, and Moshe&#8217;s shouting back, &#8220;You&#8217;re savages. You&#8217;re killing your soul. You have to stop.&#8221; Surrealistic things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I found that also kind of a startling reality of how someone would react in that situation where you have this guy telling all of the other people that by participating in this you&#8217;re killing a part of your own mortality, a part of your own soul.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You interviewed a number of people from different perspectives, including someone who was a participant in the attack against this Eritrean man. In fact, one of the people who actually threw the bench on top of him is one of the main characters of your film.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Yeah. We looked for all the eyewitnesses and we were, you know, at the beginning, very interested in the people who were active in the beating of Habtom Zarhum. And they were very hostile, you know, against media that time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it was very hard in the beginning to convince them, but we got to this person who is the main, now in the trial that is going on, is one of the main characters. He has three children, and he&#8217;s in a prison officer in the south.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he was driving his car, with another, you know, another prison officer and he heard a shot, shooting outside, he was driving and he saw people screaming and coming out from the bus terminal. And he stopped his car outside on the on the road and he run inside, people running out, and he&#8217;s running inside, and he&#8217;s saying to himself: &#8220;There&#8217;s a terror attack, I&#8217;m going to help.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he gets there and it&#8217;s already after Habtom is shot, and Habtom is on the floor, and he gets near. And then there&#8217;s another shooting, and everybody&#8217;s running, and Haftom is alone on the floor and, Ronen, who is a prison officer, tells himself, &#8220;Oh, this is the terrorist, I must neutralize him.&#8221; He&#8217;s moving, nobody&#8217;s here. And he&#8217;s taking this bench and throwing it on him. And from there he&#8217;s starting being also very violent with this guy who he thinks is it is the terrorist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And before we met Ronen Cohen, me and Asaf, too, we had this image of those guys, you know? And he looked to us like a monster, like who is this guy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the minute we met him, after like ten minutes, we understood that he&#8217;s the same just like us. He&#8217;s not a monster, he&#8217;s not a terrible man, he&#8217;s very nice. He&#8217;s the hero, even, I guess much better than me. Because he wouldn&#8217;t hide, he goes inside, you know, he wanted to save people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then we started listening to him, you know, this was the whole point for us to understand how Ronen Cohen can go inside as a hero and come out as this terrible man, who is lynching this poor guy. You know? How, where is this place that you become cruel? There&#8217;s a place. Everybody has this place, I believe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> This is in a film about cruelty not about, you know, the hero that is taking the right step and everyone&#8217;s you know having the catharsis of the good prevail. No, this is about cruelty coming out of normal people, of good people, of something evil coming outside of us — of us — and this is, you know, what we emphasize here. There is no the bad guy. There is no the evil guy. It&#8217;s us, we are the evil, in one point or we could be, you know, hero in different points.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we saw like, regular people that could be our friends, that could be our relatives, and they were really acting as you saw it, in an animalistic you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Like a mob, mob violence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Exactly. Exactly. And this is the complexity of the human, you know, the human soul that could go in extremes. And this is one of the extremes, you know, that we met.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was the reaction in Israel when it became clear that a mob attacked this man, an Eritrean migrant, and that he had nothing to do with the terror attack that day?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> It was the same day, actually, you know, it happened. It was two hours after the first shooting, and it was very interesting also to see it, amazing actually, because while everyone thought this is the terrorist, they react actually like the mob. Even the newscast, you know, they were saying, &#8220;This is the terrorist.&#8221; And they were showing footage you would never show, because they thought this is terrorist. OK? So they were acting the same way like the mob. This is what I felt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The minute the mistake came out, they started saying, &#8220;Lynch, lynching, lynch.&#8221; Started blaming — the other day we saw Ronen Cohen like an animal, laughing in the television you know, a shot of him in the jail. And the minute it starts saying, &#8220;Lynching, animals!&#8221; exactly like the people inside, and people were talking about it for two days. And that&#8217;s it. Why? Because, at that time, we had here, every day, we had like three terrorist attacks a day, three terrorist attacks a day, so people forgot about it after two days. The next tragedy: stabbing here, running people over with the cars, you know it was every day. Every day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the government here told people, this is why it also happened, told people, you know, Bibi, I remember Bibi, you know, saying to us, &#8220;Listen, you have to protect yourself.&#8221; We have three times a day terror attacks. Take out your knives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Carry your guns with you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Carry your guns and knives and protect yourself. I remember this. So, this was the, you know —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> The atmosphere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> The vibe here. Protect yourself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, Bibi himself, I guess, bears some responsibility, it&#8217;s like legitimizing this kind of people taking matters into their own hands even if they don&#8217;t have any evidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, they were encouraging the people to protect themselves, but, you know, but there was a reason for that. Because I just try to imagine what you see now in Europe, yeah?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> There was this terror attack —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Every day. Every day, here. For a month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What happened to the people who ultimately participated in the murder of Habtom Zarhum?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>AS: Well, it was determined, you know, at the hospital, that Habtom was killed by the gunshots. The gunshots really, destroyed the liver totally and this is the cause of death. So, they&#8217;re not being accused of murder, they&#8217;re being accused of this special —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Like you want to hurt someone severely, to cause him, you know, even death. So, the punishment on this it&#8217;s up to 20 years. It&#8217;s very, and it&#8217;s, for the first time in Israel, there&#8217;s a trial going on —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> For a lynching.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> For lynching.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Yes, first time. The trial is still going.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Yes, the trial is going on for almost two years, now. And only in October, they&#8217;re starting hearing the witnesses. Only in October.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we close the interview, I want to as each of you for your final thoughts, and whether your personal views changed over the course of making this film, from the moment seeing this breaking news on TV, through interviewing everyone involved in getting the footage, did your personal views change of it, of this incident? We can begin with you, Tali.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> My views before we started making the film was completely different. I thought there was bad guys and good guys. I didn&#8217;t understand the chaos. I didn&#8217;t understand the lack of orientation, the panic, I saw the attackers as animals. I didn&#8217;t think, even, that I can be in their position. And after we started talking to people, seeing the footage, I understood that there is no me and Ronen Cohen. We are the same. It started with the question: Why? Why to be so cruel? Why? It was like, OK, it was like, these are bad people. And I ended up saying, I hope, if I would be in this place, in this terrorist attack someday, I hope I won&#8217;t, I will help people, I will be like Moshe Kochavi, but I think I would run and pray. Run for my life, and pray. But.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s OK. (laughs)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> (laughs) I don&#8217;t think I will be a hero.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> We want to survive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> In the beginning, I thought, &#8220;I would never do this, I would never be the person.&#8221; But it&#8217;s so complicated, and I wish I would be a hero like Moshe Kochavi, this is really what I want to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Asaf, same question to you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> I think, I&#8217;m more shocked by violence, just the violent actions cut really deep inside my soul. And uh, really deep fear of violence right now that wasn&#8217;t there before. And, I hope it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know — it&#8217;s going to stay that way. I&#8217;m not going to join any tribal acts in the future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well it&#8217;s an incredibly powerful film that you&#8217;ve made and I want to thank you guys for being with us. Asaf Sudry, and Tali Shemesh, thank you for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TS:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Thank you.

Trump threw rolls of paper towels at hurricane survivors in Puerto Rico and gave himself an A+ for his (lack of a) response to the disaster.

And this is episode 30 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And what happened in Las Vegas is, in many ways, a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job. And we&#8217;ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We live in a sick country. We live in a country where it is legal for someone to purchase 30 assault weapons, and unlimited ammunition. We live in a country where it&#8217;s legal to buy weapons that really only have one purpose: to hunt and kill other human beings. We live in a country where a cabal of high-powered lobbyists, bought off politicians, and merchants of death profit off of the massacres of other human beings. We live in a country where the gun manufacturers love a mass shooting, and we live in a country where the Second Amendment of the Constitution has been laundered through lobbyists, and some Supreme Court justices, to mean something that it does not mean.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The National Rifle Association, the NRA, whose leadership would be viewed as terrorist enablers and promoters in a sane society, they don&#8217;t like the first part of the Second Amendment, so much so that they don&#8217;t even include it in their very public memorializing of their Holy Bible of gun addiction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the NRA&#8217;s headquarters, their version of the Second Amendment doesn&#8217;t include the first half of the Second Amendment. The NRA really only wants you to focus on the second half which says, &#8220;The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&#8221; The first part of the Second Amendment, which the NRA finds very inconvenient to include on its headquarters, states &#8220;a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a Free State.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Was this Las Vegas shooter a member of a well-regulated militia? No. Were any of these murderers who shoot up schools or religious assemblies or workplaces, were they members of a well-regulated militia? No. And regulated — that&#8217;s an interesting word, because no thoughtful person can really argue that guns in the United States are actually regulated in any meaningful way. In fact, in this country, you can buy dozens of assault weapons. You can store enough guns and ammunition in your house or garage to wage a small war. Why? Because very powerful politicians, businesses, and their gangster-style lobbyists have twisted the meaning of the Second Amendment so intensely that it no longer even matters why it was written or what it actually was intended for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This Coalition of the Killing fans the flames of fear and promotes the idea that guns keep us safe, that the solution to gun killings is more guns. And they make a shitload of money off of all the death and misery and massacres. And they will make more money off of the Las Vegas massacre.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You can murder 20 small, innocent children between the ages of six and seven, at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and these horrid villains are unmoved in their belief in the golden calf of assault rifles. &#8220;If only the teachers had been armed, those kids might be alive today. Now let&#8217;s check out our stock prices.&#8221; It&#8217;s sick.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Each time we&#8217;re faced with a new mass murder with guns, in this case more than 59 killed, more than 500 wounded, we end up in the same place: “Let&#8217;s pray. Let&#8217;s tweak this law or that law. Let&#8217;s talk about putting in acoustic sensors to detect gunshots. Let&#8217;s put armed private security in schools. Let&#8217;s use the terrorist database, the watch list, to deny gun purchases. Let&#8217;s have more surveillance. Let&#8217;s do religious and racial profiling.” Which is itself absurd, given that most mass shooters are white.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>None of what most politicians and most TV pundits offer up in the aftermath of these killings is going to do anything to solve the real issue: We are a nation filled to the brim with guns, including assault weapons that are actually meant for assaulting people. Not for hunting. Not for sport, unless your sport is murdering people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Watch what happens in Congress in the coming days. Empty platitudes. Bullshit proposals: &#8220;We must do something about this.&#8221; And, of course, a lot of prayer. But none of that is going to result in any change to the fact that we live in a sick society that believes guns bring us security. A nation that has been taught by powerful, twisted people, that guns are not at all part of the problem. That everything except guns and how easy they are to get is the problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mental illness is the problem. Muslims are the problem. Gangbangers in Chicago are the problem. Not having a gun is the problem. And when these mass shootings happen, a majority of the times the shooter is a white man. And we want to know who he was, and why did it, and what was his motive, as we should. But compare that to how black victims of police killings are treated in the media: “Well, did they do drugs? What were they wearing at the time? Did they have a criminal record? Did they listen to hip hop music? Where are the fathers?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trayvon Martin, after George Zimmerman killed him, was characterized as a thug, and his hooded sweatshirt was somehow evidence that he was scary or menacing. That&#8217;s how black victims are portrayed. Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was called a thug with the head of Miami&#8217;s police union, saying after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed, that if you act like a thug, you’ll get treated like a thug.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Contrast that with some of the stories we&#8217;ve seen about the Las Vegas shooter — not victim — shooter! One headline in The Washington Post said, and this is a quote, that he &#8220;enjoyed gambling, country music, lived quiet life before massacre.&#8221; Black victim is thug, white shooter is like a down-on-his-luck character from a country western song who just happens to murder 59 people. It&#8217;s sick. And this is a pattern.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What if these shootings that involve white men killing large groups of people, what if they were covered the way that stories involving shooters of other races are covered on a daily basis in this country? How about this narrative: White man shoots up largely white crowd at a country western concert? White on white crime. Let&#8217;s investigate country music and its violent lyrics: What role did all of this play? Where was the shooter&#8217;s family? Let&#8217;s find some white people brave enough to speak out on this pandemic of white men conducting mass shootings at an alarming rate. And let&#8217;s make them speak for their entire race.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We all know why the narratives are different. And another thing: we&#8217;re once again hearing that this is the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history. It&#8217;s just not true. In fact, there are several examples of white gunmen killing huge numbers of black people. The 1917 East St. Louis massacre resulted in an estimated 100 black people being shot and lynched; 1873, between 60 and 150 black people were massacred in Colfax, Louisiana. We don&#8217;t even know the exact numbers of Native Americans killed in mass shootings since the founding of the United States: hundreds were killed in places like Sand Creek, Clear Lake and Wounded Knee. And these are just examples of concentrated killings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Donald Trump, who boasts that he&#8217;ll be the best friend the NRA could possibly have in the White House, he suddenly found God when he first addressed the Las Vegas shooting. Let&#8217;s be real: Trump&#8217;s deepest connection to the Bible is watching Charlton Heston as Moses. But religious Trump, who speaks from the Scriptures, was praised for his perfect tone across the media. Specifically, on CNN. “Just what we needed to hear.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A big part of our problem on guns is how it&#8217;s discussed in the media. And presidents who get prayerful are praised instead of held accountable for the role that they play in sustaining this nation&#8217;s gun addiction, in promoting the gun industry that profits off of the murder of our fellow human beings. When the shooter is an Arab or a Muslim, they are often immediately branded as a terrorist or a terrorist suspect. The president and other politicians, right after Las Vegas, called this shooter &#8220;deranged&#8221; or &#8220;insane&#8221; or another word that&#8217;s lost all meaning — &#8220;evil.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And when it&#8217;s a Muslim shooter, it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to talk about what the US response should be: watch listing, banning people from coming into the country, the profiling of Muslim, surveillance of mosques. But when white people are killed, don&#8217;t talk about guns. That&#8217;s politicizing the killings. That disrespects the victims. Whether it&#8217;s someone inspired by ISIS murdering his coworkers or a white man shooting up a school or a white man gunning down Sikhs because he thought they were Muslims, they all do it with guns.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We don&#8217;t need prayers. We don&#8217;t need fake unity over the tragedy. We need to look at the common factor in all of these heinous acts of mass murder: guns. Anything else is just talking about putting a band aid on a gaping, infected, and lethal wound on our society.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now a few words about how mass shootings are covered and the rush to draw conclusions about why the shooter did it, and who they&#8217;re connected to and were there any warning signs. I wanted to get some analysis from Dave Cullen. He wrote an excellent and very important book on the Columbine shooting that took place in April of 1999. That&#8217;s when two young men killed 12 of their fellow students and a teacher. Dave&#8217;s book is called Columbine, and he says that in the vast majority of mass shooting cases, the information that&#8217;s spread right in the aftermath, is always incomplete and very often turns out to be flat-out wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dave Cullen:\u003c/strong> Ok, so right now, we&#8217;re a few days out and we know very little, which is actually normal, which is kind of — you know, but the media narrative right now is like, &#8220;Oh, this is so strange, we don&#8217;t know anything,&#8221; when in fact, often, we always have all these clues, these gigantic clues, most of which tend to be wrong. And so, we&#8217;re sort of actually in this blissful ignorance situation this time where we don&#8217;t have the sort of false narratives to go on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At this point after Oklahoma City, we were sure obviously he was a Middle East terrorist. At this point, after Virginia Tech, NBC, was about to receive the package of all the videotapes, the manifesto, because he had misaddressed it, he sent it to the wrong place and so it took an extra day to get to them. After Columbine, we were about to discover the big propane bombs, and, which would lead us to discover, oh, this was mainly intended as a bombing, secondarily a shooting. We also thought in this case, we were very sure that it was all about targeting jocks, none of which was true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, this time we don&#8217;t have any of the false narratives yet, we have very few things to go on. Except we do know that he&#8217;s a very much an outlier in age. We think of most of these things as being people who are sort of post-adolescent, you know, shortly after either high school or early 20s. That is one big cohort.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s actually two major age cohorts. One is that one. The bigger one is actually what I call 40ish, which is if you go just a little beyond 39 to 51, 40 percent of the shooters were in that cohort. So, most of, the biggest chunk is a sort of like middle age, perhaps middle-age crisis time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Dave Cullen said his research has determined a few basic categories that mass shooters fall into.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> I did a piece for Newsweek about three or four years ago that looked at the three largest clusters of shooters. The biggest is those angry depressives. So, it was depressives, people then who are, turn angry at the world and want to take out a bunch of people with them. That&#8217;s sort of in a nutshell. That&#8217;s one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The second group is deeply mentally ill, in the sense of losing touch with reality. It&#8217;s a smaller group, but significant. And that&#8217;s people like we had from, you know, Gabby Giffords — from Virginia Tech, and quite a few of the other ones. Where it&#8217;s usually some type of schizophrenia, sometimes paranoid schizophrenia, where they&#8217;re sometimes hearing voices — totally out of touch with reality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we have to always make the point that most people who have these conditions are not shooters. In fact, statistically they&#8217;re more likely to be nonviolent than violent, so we don&#8217;t want to stigmatize those. But those are the second group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The third group, by far the smallest, is psychopaths. They&#8217;re a very small number who do these sorts of things, but that is a third group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then you have obviously terrorists, and then you have sort of outliers that don&#8217;t fall. But for the most part, those three, plus terrorists, explain most of these people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Dave Cullen is the author of the book Columbine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Now, I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you&#8217;ve thrown our budget a little out of whack. But if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, 16 verses literally thousands of people, you can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well from one horror to the next: President Trump visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday and it was an embarrassing, yet unfortunately not shocking, display of insecurity, vindictiveness, and narcissism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20th. It took Trump 12 days to actually make his brief visit there, and have pictures taken of him passing out bags of rice and literally throwing rolls of paper towels into a group of Puerto Ricans that were gathered in a church for Trump&#8217;s photo op.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>During those 12 days when Trump couldn&#8217;t go to Puerto Rico, he spent four days at his Bedminster golf resort, while tweeting attacks at the mayor of San Juan. He also found time to attend the President&#8217;s Cup golf outing and more tweeting of attacks that portrayed Puerto Ricans as lazy. On Trump&#8217;s tightly controlled and very brief trip to Puerto Rico the president repeatedly heaped praise on himself and his administration&#8217;s response to the hurricane. He compared the deaths and human suffering in Puerto Rico to those during Hurricane Katrina, as though Puerto Ricans should be grateful that they didn&#8217;t have what happened during Katrina.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Everything always seems like a game show where Trump is the shameless, and clueless, and tone-deaf host.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By contrast, many high-profile people of Puerto Rican descent have been working tirelessly to raise funds and awareness of the catastrophe in Puerto Rico. Lin Manuel Miranda, the creator and star of Hamilton, has been working around the clock raising money, doing fund raising, speaking — though he did pause a few times to tweet to Trump that he&#8217;s most definitely going straight to hell. “No long lines for you.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The singer-songwriter Alynda Segarra, who is Puerto Rican, from the Bronx in New York has also been doing a lot of fundraising and outreach. And the band that she leads, Hurray for the Riff Raff has a new album out that is just phenomenal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, as it turns out, it&#8217;s incredibly timely. The album is called The Navigator, and it&#8217;s sort of like a play told in acts, with the main character Navita Milagros Negrón, as an unlikely superhero, travelling through a world of gentrification, privatization, segregation, neocolonialism. I&#8217;ve been a longtime fan of Hurray for the Riff Raff and this album really is something special and different. It&#8217;s also clear that the album is a living documentary on Alynda Segarra&#8217;s own journey to connect with her roots, including those in Puerto Rico. We&#8217;re joined now by Alynda Segarra of Hurray for the Riff Raff. Alynda, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Alynda Segarra:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your general reflections on this album with the backdrop of all of this reality in Puerto Rico and in Washington.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> I think when I first started making this album and creating the concept, I was just trying to heal some of my own wounds and I was trying to get deep into my ancestry and to really understand what it means to be a child of the diaspora. Obviously, as I was writing it, Trump&#8217;s campaign was picking up speed. And, you know, I was writing a lot of it coming from this place of &#8220;I am a Latina in this country and I need to make a very strong stance on my pride of where I come from.&#8221; And then also I was looking into what it means to be like the person that I am, which is I live in the middle of so many identities. You know? I was thinking about what it meant to be a city kid, a New York City kid, a kid from the Bronx. And to be pushed out of the city because I can&#8217;t afford to live there. And what does it mean to then travel all over the country, kind of like searching for a home. You know? There were so many personal statements I was making that I was like, kind of using this character, Navita, as a medium to take these very personal experiences and try to turn it into like a fable or a story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The whole interesting part about creating a character in a story is you have to teach them a lesson. So, I was trying to teach Navita a lesson, you know, in pride and in like not being able to run from who you come from and where you come from. No matter how ashamed you might be. No matter how much people have forced — or society has forced that shame upon you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, and a lot of my pride came from learning about the Young Lords. That was such a eureka moment for me. I had been told my whole life that I did not fit into what a Puerto Rican woman was, or was supposed to be. My whole life, by many different types of people, I was told that. And then I learned about the Young Lords and I see these revolutionary feminists, you know, that are like taking charge in the 70s and are incredibly intersectional. And I just suddenly felt like I belonged, for the first time in my life, and it made me really think about what it means to dig deep into hidden history. The history that a lot of people in power do not want people of color and oppressed people to find out about, because it encourages you to be yourself and to continue on and to stand up for all oppressed people, all over the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;The Navigator&#8221; by Hurray for the Riff Raff]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS\u003c/strong>: And the whole time I was creating the story about Navita travelling through time, watching her city become so gentrified and segregated, I was trying to create this like dystopian, Sci-Fi reality. Rican Beach, for example, is a place in my story where all of the people of color have been pushed out onto. It&#8217;s kind of a garbage island, shanty town. There&#8217;s a wall around them and they are just hidden from sight. But they are used to be workers and to, you know, kind of these like servants for everybody on the mainland. And now, as I watch this destruction go on in Puerto Rico, it&#8217;s like well, what&#8217;s the difference? Where there are so many people in this country that don&#8217;t even know Puerto Rico is like considered a part of the United States. And that these people are citizens. They don&#8217;t know anything about it. They see it as like a welfare island that we should get rid of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Rican Beach&#8221; live by Hurray for the Riff Raff]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Puerto Rico has a population the same or bigger than 21 of the states in the United States.

You know, when I was growing up I remember I couldn&#8217;t ever find the Puerto Rican flag in a textbook. And I felt very confused, sitting in my like fourth grade classroom, being like, &#8220;Well, where&#8217;s our flag?&#8221; Why aren&#8217;t we in there? Does this mean we don&#8217;t exist? Like, what does that mean, you know? It&#8217;s a very important time for the people of the diaspora to say, &#8220;We remember where we come from and you cannot cut us off.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Rican Beach,&#8221; live by Alynda Segarra]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On this album, you really do feel that sense of connecting with your history that you&#8217;re describing and for people that aren&#8217;t familiar with the Young Lords, this was a movement of Puerto Ricans in the United States, and a political ally of the Black Panthers. And they were deeply involved with community organizing, breakfast programs, literacy campaigns, but also engaged in a militant confrontation of racist police state and the government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Young Lord:\u003c/strong> And should we make no distinction between the jails and our streets, and people are killed in the streets all the time.

We say that it&#8217;s all the same thing, it&#8217;s genocide against third-world people, black and Puerto Rican people, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re charging the city with murder.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And they were inspired by radical Puerto Rican independentistas, some of them like Pedro Albizu Campos, who were imprisoned, you know, for a quarter of a century for attempting to overthrow the United States government in Puerto Rico.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean there&#8217;s this rich history of resistance in Puerto Rico, but also among diaspora people in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Yeah and also what I thought was really inspiring for me was I saw the thread of art and poetry that really was such an important aspect of keeping Puerto Rican identity alive. Because it&#8217;s really incredible that this island, which has never been able to have independence, has such an intense idea of who it is. You know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like Puerto Rican identity is carried throughout time, and I think a lot of it has to do with poetry and music. And that&#8217;s where I felt like I really belonged was, &#8220;Wow, this is my destiny, to be a part of this tradition. To keep this idea alive and to not let the identity die.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know in the kind of contrast of the influences that I&#8217;ve read you cite to be really fascinating. You talked about, as a younger person, watching videos of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Mood Indigo,” by Frank Sinatra]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Mhmm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And also the Dead Kennedys and Bikini Kill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[“Rebel Girl,” Bikini Kill]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And then you have Woody Guthrie but also then starting to unpack this rich culture of Puerto Rican music and artistic contribution. [Ghetto Brothers plays] And I&#8217;m wondering how you reconcile all of these influences in the context of what you&#8217;ve just produced on this new album.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> It has a lot to do with, obviously traveling the country the way that I did. Leaving home so early and throwing myself into a lifestyle of being a hobo: hitchhiking and riding trains and just being dependent on the kindness of strangers, literally. You know, I was out to see the country in a very romantic way. I just had this yearning for adventure and I really wanted to experience America in this beatnik, hobo lifestyle that I got from Woody Guthrie and from the beatnik poets and stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I was really influenced by American folk music. What I loved about American folk music, that I think was what I loved about punk rock, was it was the story of the people. It was people telling their experiences and trying to get across information and to spread warnings and to spread stories. And that&#8217;s what I loved about it!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Got No Home,&#8221; by Woodie Guthrie]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> And now making this album, and looking back, it really feels to me like it was an education on what it means to me to be an American. To really know how much immigrant people have done for this country. I feel like I have a very personal experience of that. And to also say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve traveled all over the country. I&#8217;ve slept in the parks. I&#8217;ve like, depended on people to pick me up when it was raining.” You know? I have a very important experience with this country and I think it gives me this foundation and these roots, where I feel like I can speak out, and I feel like it&#8217;s my duty to speak out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think, like many people, when Trump won, I was devastated and frightened and I felt like, “I&#8217;ve worked so hard my whole life to just become who I am and now this man is going to come and take it all away from me.” And my experience with traveling and with American folk music has made me stand up and be like, &#8220;No! That&#8217;s not happening. I&#8217;m staying here. And I&#8217;m going to say the truth, you know? This is my fucking country too and I&#8217;m not going anywhere.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What gives you hope? What keeps you going when you get up in the morning? What gives you hope about humanity?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Music gives me hope. Ancestry gives me hope. Art gives me hope. Children give me hope — (starts to cry). Sorry, I knew this is going to happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The more I learn about where my people come from and the more I learn about the history of oppressed people all over the world, I am just amazed by the strength of the human spirit. I really am. And it&#8217;s just like — and also by folk music of all kinds, you listen to it. And it&#8217;s just this the story of people who were in so much pain and they continued on and they left a song for their great, great grandchildren to sing when things got really bad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I hope that I can leave songs behind that will do that for people. That can do that for people right now. Because Woody Guthrie did that for me, whether he, you know he&#8217;ll never know, but I&#8217;ve really tried to go to a place in my personal life where I&#8217;m asking for hope from nature, because I don&#8217;t know how to get it from human beings right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know? For those days where you&#8217;re like: music isn&#8217;t doing it, poetry is not doing it and reading the news is definitely not doing it, I&#8217;m turning to the power of nature, because I feel like as all of this is happening around us, sometimes you just have to sit quietly and look at a flower and be like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do. I want to keep going and I want to spread love, I know that.” As a kid from the Bronx who grew up on punk rock, I never thought I&#8217;d be doing that but desperate times call for moments like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and I don&#8217;t know where I heard it, but I do know that this land was made for you and me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AS:\u003c/strong> Also, I heard Dolores Huerta say in a interview recently, it&#8217;s a Pablo Neruda quote, &#8220;They tried to cut down all the flowers but they couldn&#8217;t hold back the spring.&#8221; That&#8217;s what “pa&#8217;lante” means to me. You know, young people are giving me so much hope. I just think young people have found a way to use the internet, to use social media, to spread information that has been hidden from them, and to spread pride and to spread also ideas about self-care that I think is really important. So that gives me a lot of hope as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, amen to that.

When we come back, we&#8217;re going to talk to a former US Army Ranger who became a conscientious objector and a war resister. And while he was in that elite army unit, very few people supported him. But one of those was the late NFL star Pat Tillman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we&#8217;re going to look at the false mythology that is constantly used by politicians about the civil rights movement, about Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks.

A poll this week from USA Today found that more than two thirds of Americans think that President Trump&#8217;s position on the NFL players who have taken the knee to protest police killings of black and brown people is wrong. The poll reveals that a majority of people support the rights of the players, and oppose Trump&#8217;s calls for them to be fired and the NFL boycotted. By the way, a third of Republicans were among those against Trump in that poll.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This issue clearly continues to torment Trump&#8217;s head. He can&#8217;t seem to shut up about it, even in the midst of all of the other really high stakes stuff happening in the world Among Trump supporters, there are all sorts of memes floating around calling for an NFL boycott and blasting the players. And the central line of attack has been that the players are somehow disrespecting military veterans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the images that Trump retweeted is an image of the now famous veteran who died in Afghanistan. It was that of former NFL star Pat Tillman. Tillman played for the Arizona Cardinals and he enlisted in the U.S. Army and became a ranger right after 9/11.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The tweet that Trump promoted to his 30 million or so followers featured a picture of Tillman in his military uniform and his Ranger beret. And the message underneath it read, &#8220;NFL player Pat Tillman joined U.S. Army in 2002. And he was killed in action in 2004. He fought for our country, freedom #standforouranthem #boycottNFL.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now clearly President Trump knows nothing about Pat Tillman story&#8217;s or the cover-up at the highest levels of the U.S. military or the circumstances surrounding Tillman&#8217;s death in Afghanistan. Trump seems to be totally unaware of Tillman&#8217;s correspondence with the legendary dissident Noam Chomsky, completely ignorant of Tillman&#8217;s views on the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. Pat Tillman is not the poster boy for the hyper-militarized, fake nationalism Trump wants the NFL-merged-with-the-military to be. Tillman was, it seems, the polar opposite of that image.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Joining me now is a former U.S. Army Ranger who knew Pat Tillman and served with him in the 2nd Ranger Battalion. Rory Fanning wrote a great book about his year-long walk in 2008, 2009, across the United States when he was raising funds for the Pat Tillman Foundation. That book is called, &#8220;Worth Fighting For: An Army Ranger&#8217;s Journey Out of the Military and Across America.&#8221; Fanning served two tours in Afghanistan before becoming a conscientious objector.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rory Fanning:\u003c/strong> I mean I had a sense that this was the case, but we were essentially drawing the Taliban back into the fight. And it was very quiet when I got there in early- and mid-2002. I didn&#8217;t know at the time that Taliban had surrendered by that time and I think our job was draw them back into the fight.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And when did you first meet Pat Tillman?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> I met him in Ranger school.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So you guys were in Ranger school together and then deployed together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> We deployed at separate times. We mostly spent our time together in battalion. I got to know Pat basically after I decided to become a war resister after my second tour to Afghanistan. What went into that decision, to become a conscientious objector, a war resister?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well I signed up to make the world a safer place, and to prevent another terrorist attack. And I realized after two tours in Afghanistan that I was only making the world more dangerous. You know, a rocket would land in our camp and we would call in a five-hundred-pound bomb attack on that general vicinity over there. We know now that, you know, up to 80 percent of everybody who&#8217;s died since 2001 has been a civilian. And I think I was there giving people reason to fight when they otherwise had no interest in fighting. The world&#8217;s a far more dangerous place as a result of what we&#8217;re doing there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, we&#8217;re going to talk about your walk across country in a bit. But first I was hoping you could share the impact that Pat Tillman had on you and your development, moving from enthusiastically signing up for the Rangers to ultimately becoming a resister.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Well after I decided I was going to become probably the first war resister after 9/11 in the Ranger Battalion, certainly in the 2nd Ranger Battalion, the entire battalion turned their backs on me. And, you know, I was washing dishes, absorbing the general ridicule the chain of command and expecting to go to jail at any time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There was two people that weren&#8217;t afraid to talk to me during that time and it was Pat Tillman and his brother Kevin. These guys were amazing people. You know? Critical thinkers. They, you know, for fun would write papers on anything from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the question of God and religion and exchange them with each other. I mean these guys were really impressive and I was shocked and impressed that they stood by me when no one else would.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why do you think the Tillman brothers did that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> I think they respected my decision. I think Pat saw firsthand, you know, he was in the frontyard during the Jessica Lynch operation. I think on some level he may have been disillusioned with the war on terror and Iraq certainly. I think he believed that was illegal. So yeah, I think we had that in common.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re saying, you know, that Pat Tillman believed that the war in Iraq was illegal? \u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> We had discussions along those lines.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Where were you when Pat Tillman was killed?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> I was basically up in my bunk, they had just deployed. I was called down, expecting to be sent off to jail or the big Army to become a bullet stopper is, that&#8217;s what we called, you know, the big army in the Ranger battalion. And I was told that Pat was killed in an enemy ambush and that he died a hero. Within seven days, after six months in kind of a state of purgatory, within the Ranger regiment, because they had no idea what to do with me, I was ushered out of the military. And I was shocked that that was the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;ve written that you think that Pat Tillman&#8217;s killing, and, of course, the military stated that it was a friendly fire incident, but you&#8217;ve written that you believe that what happened with Pat Tillman&#8217;s death expedited and ultimately resulted in your ability to get conscientious objector status. Why?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Well they were covering up Pat&#8217;s death to the highest levels of the US government at the time, and, I think, I had just called the inspector general to do an investigation on my case, and I think they wanted to avoid that extra scrutiny on the battalion at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, of course, there have been documentaries about Pat Tillman that explores these questions and there&#8217;s been a fair bit of probing of what actually happened when he was killed. What&#8217;s your best assessment particularly, because you were in the Rangers and you know how the units operate, what&#8217;s your best assessment based on what we know of what actually happened to Pat Tillman?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, to this day I think the events surrounding that day are suspicious in the sense that Pat&#8217;s uniform and diary were burned. The fact that they didn&#8217;t communicate what really happened and they took Kevin Tillman&#8217;s weapon away at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean it&#8217;s all suspicious, but I could also see, like I said, at this point in time, Afghanistan was a relatively quiet place, and there was a bunch of very trigger-happy Rangers at that time wanting to kind of earn their stripes overseas. And I could see how overenthusiastic soldiers may have misidentified Pat as someone who they thought was the enemy. But I can&#8217;t speak one way or another. I think the most important part of this entire case is the fact that no one has been held accountable for Pat&#8217;s death to this day, all the way to the highest levels of the Bush Administration at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and, in fact, some of the key players in this cover up, namely General Stanley McChrystal who himself was the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command and had held other senior posts in the military, participated directly in this cover up and he now runs his own consulting firm. He has a teaching post at Yale University. Far from being held accountable, it seems people like McChrystal, and also Admiral William McRaven who is now the head of the University of Texas University system, people who were involved with CIA torture programs, they seem to be landing these cushy jobs at elite or big public universities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Yeah, they seem relatively untouchable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and eminently promotable, it seems.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When Tillman was killed, your reaction to that in part was to organize a walk across the United States to benefit the Pat Tillman Foundation. Why did you decide to do that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> I mean Pat stood by me. I mean I would have gone to jail or the big army had not things worked out the way they did. And Pat was the only person who stood by me at the time and, you know, I just wanted to bring attention to Pat&#8217;s sacrifice. I was still pretty scared about what happened to me during that six months of limbo in the Ranger battalion, so I wasn&#8217;t talking about exactly what had happened to me during that walk, you know, I was just walking to raise awareness for the Pat Tillman Foundation. He gave up $3.6 million to leave the NFL to go to the military. I was trying to raise that for his foundation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that walk, you know, essentially gave me the courage to start talking about what I saw in Afghanistan and support people who are largely resisting the project of the U.S. empire right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s your response to the president of the United States using Pat Tillman&#8217;s name to attack NFL players who are kneeling in protest during the national anthem?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Well I think it&#8217;s disgraceful. Pat&#8217;s memory should not be politicized, particularly in this way. You know, Pat was from a different era, so to say what would Pat have done, I think it is kind of hard to do and not necessarily worth doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He is also taking away attention from the actual reasons and motivations for that protest, Trump is, you know this protest being about police brutality and mass incarceration that this disproportionately affects people of color.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We know a fair bit about the thought process that was going on with Pat Tillman in part because of his correspondence with his family, but also he had a correspondence with Noam Chomsky.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Noam Chomsky:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s in essence true, but that the specific facts are that shortly before he went to Afghanistan, I was contacted by — he couldn&#8217;t do it, but I was contacted by his friends and family. And we did arrange to meet when he came back. And I don&#8217;t want to say what was on his mind, of course, but it was pretty clear from the discussion that he wanted to discuss the question of the justice of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, and other regional issues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Pat stood for the exploited and the oppressed. You know, he stood up, you know for people who stood up for themselves. And I think he would have a lot more in common with someone like Colin Kaepernick and Michael Bennett, than he would those who jeer and try to repress dissent from the sidelines.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When you&#8217;ve seen NFL games, and you&#8217;ve seen the kind of overt, militaristic messaging that has become a staple of NFL Sunday, the jets flying over, the national anthem, the whole thing is just sort of dripping in militarism. As someone who was in an elite special operations forces unit, the Army Rangers, what happens on an emotional level, being you, watching this. Having been in the elite forces of the United States Military and then becoming a conscientious objector and a war resister, what do you think of the NFL and the military?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Well first and foremost, I see it as a recruiting tool. I think, you know, players weren&#8217;t forced to come out and put their hands over their heart and sing the national anthem until 2009 when public support for, you know, the global war on terror and Iraq were at an all-time low.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean so this is the military and Department of Defense, you know, targeting the sweet spot of military recruiting, those who kind of endorse and get behind this aggressive sport that prioritizes self-sacrifice, et cetera. So, I see an opportunism of sorts to keep the 800 military bases around the world filled. I also see it as a way to buy the silence of people who want to speak out, who feel disillusioned by what the U.S. has done around the world since 2001, you know, by trotting out soldiers, patting them on the back and calling them heroes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, heroes don&#8217;t kill innocent people, heroes don&#8217;t fight so a small percentage of the population can become wealthy at the expense of everybody else. Heroes don&#8217;t overthrow country&#8217;s leaders. Heroes don&#8217;t occupy for no good reason. And so, none of that is really communicated during these gaudy, flag-waving parades, and sporting events, and concerts and the like.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How do you want Pat Tillman to be remembered?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Someone who stood for the exploited and the oppressed. Somebody who wasn&#8217;t afraid to stand by me, when, in my personal experience, when I was going through one of the roughest times of my life, you know, with no fear of what the rest of the group thought of him at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alright, Rory Fanning, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RF:\u003c/strong> Alright, thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Rory Fanning is a former U.S. Army Ranger who served with Pat Tillman. He&#8217;s also the author of the excellent book, &#8220;Worth Fighting For: An Army Ranger&#8217;s Journey Out of the Military and Across America.&#8221; Rory now spends a lot of time speaking to high school students and universities about his experience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> A lot of the debate around these NFL players kneeling seems to occur in a historical vacuum. The history of athletes and protest is seldom mentioned. And, what&#8217;s worse, the reason why Colin Kaepernick and his comrades began protesting during the national anthem has been drowned out in the shouting. Last week, I saw an image circulating online that showed Martin Luther King, Jr. with his hand over his heart in respect for the American flag. It was accompanied by a message from a Trump supporter saying, &#8220;MLK didn&#8217;t take the knee in protest of the flag or anthem, he took the knee in prayer to God.&#8221; That was followed by the hashtag #boycottNFL.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In fact, a lot of people on the right seem to love using King to defend all sorts of things — to defend guns, would liberals have wanted, you know, King to not have been able to have a gun after a house was firebombed. They falsely claimed that Martin Luther King was a member of the Republican Party. Martin Luther King has become a malleable symbol for rampant deployment by people trying to tell protestors and black people today to shut up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the biggest problems with all of this is that it&#8217;s based on complete fiction. And total ignorance of who Martin Luther King, Jr. actually was and what he actually believed. It&#8217;s also particularly vile when used to try to suppress dissent against police killings. The same thing that happens a lot with King, also happens all the time with Rosa Parks. It happens with the civil rights movement in general. Caricatures have been created, after being sanitized, historically revised, and made palatable for mass consumption and abuse by crass politicians. An important and groundbreaking new book coming out in January digs deep into this manufactured mythology surrounding Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and other figures and movements. And it provides a nuanced portrait of the truth. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History.&#8221; Its author is Jeanne Theoharis, she&#8217;s a professor of political science at Brooklyn College in New York. Jeanne Theoharis, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jeanne Theoharis: Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your overall view of how key historical figures or moments in the civil rights movement are kind of used or inaccurately portrayed in our current discourse, either by politicians or by ordinary people having arguments online.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> I mean I think what we&#8217;ve seen, and this has happened over the past number of decades and I would argue since really Reagan changes his position and signs the King holiday, is the kind of creation of a national fable of the civil rights movement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so now the civil rights movement is used to make Americans feel good about themselves. You know, from 50th anniversary commemorations of the March on Washington, to the Selma to Montgomery march, from the dedication of King&#8217;s statue on the Mall, from the statue of Rosa Parks in Statuary Hall. All of these events have become places where we now celebrate the United States, where we feel so good about the progress we&#8217;ve made.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think in the process, these kind of dangerous ideas about what the civil rights movement was, what it entailed, how it went forth have become cemented. And so as you&#8217;re implying, politicians, citizens constantly invoke the civil rights movement in the present to justify certain kinds of positions. To chastise contemporary movements, whether it&#8217;s Black Lives Matter, whether it&#8217;s Colin Kaepernick&#8217;s stand that has now turned into a much broader stand by athletes. We&#8217;re constantly being bombarded with, &#8220;This is not what King would do.&#8221; You know, &#8220;Be like King, be like Parks,&#8221; that strip and utterly distort what the civil rights movement was and what people like King and Parks actually did and stood for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and we interviewed Tavis Smiley who wrote an excellent book about the last year of King&#8217;s life, where King was basically disinvited to everything. He was no longer embraced by the mainstream of the civil rights movement and he was increasingly denouncing U.S. imperialism talking about how &#8220;my own government is the greatest purveyor of violence on earth.&#8221; It&#8217;s the one King quote that I would love to see at an NFL game, when they have all the rockets and the war craft flying over it. Let&#8217;s put that Martin Luther King quote up about the U.S. government being the greatest purveyor of violence on earth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JH:\u003c/strong> Absolutely but I think we also need to remember that even the King at the high water mark of 1963, is not popular. So, in Gallup Poll, the week before the March on Washington, two-thirds of Americans don&#8217;t support the March on Washington. You have Congressman denouncing it as un-American. And in the wake of the March on Washington, the FBI, and the Kennedys, this is the moment when you see the escalation of surveillance of Martin Luther King, to kind of wall-to-wall surveillance of him. They call him a demagogue, the most dangerous. Even in this moment, right? We&#8217;re not even at &#8217;67 King with the public speech against the War in Vietnam, we are at King and the March on Washington, and that King is seen as dangerous, and that King is surveilled. Right? It&#8217;s not just &#8217;67 and &#8217;68 King.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What were media outlets and sort of broader liberal society saying about the tactics that Martin Luther King and others in that movement were using?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> I mean, again, if you look at polls in the early 60s, most Americans do not agree. They don&#8217;t agree with the Freedom Rides, they don&#8217;t agree with the sit-ins, they don&#8217;t agree the civil rights movement is the way to go. They&#8217;re constantly paranoid about violence. They constantly talk about violence, even though there&#8217;s no violence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve been particularly interested, partly because of my own work, which focuses a great deal on civil rights movement outside of the South, how King is received outside of the South. And if we look at how King, for instance, is received in California in the early 60s, and this is before 1965 Watts Uprising.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 1963, after much work and much civil rights activities, you see California pass a fair housing law, and white people go crazy, realtors go crazy. And they get on the ballot, Prop 14 in 1964, on the November ballot which is going to be the presidential election, and basically trying to repeal this law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And King comes multiple times, right? There&#8217;s a massive civil rights campaign in the state to try to keep the law and to vote no on the proposition. And King is repeatedly called a communist, King is picketed, King is denounced for that work in California in 1964. And then we will see, white Californians by 3:1 margin vote for Prop 14 in 1964, and they sent Lyndon Johnson back to the White House, but they, still, like in my home, I don&#8217;t want any fair housing laws. And what King will call this is a vote for ghettos, right? Because that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He writes this really beautiful thing that most people have not read in the couple months after Watts, where he&#8217;s basically like, &#8220;You invite me to your cities, and you sit up there with all this regalia, and you praise the actions of Southern black people but you know when talk turns to condition — local conditions, basically it&#8217;s polite but firm resistance.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean and Phil Ochs wrote that great song about this very phenomenon that you&#8217;re describing called, &#8220;Love Me I&#8217;m a Liberal.&#8221; And in one of the verses he says:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Phil Ochs:\u003c/strong> And I love Puerto Ricans and Negroes, as long as they don&#8217;t live next door. So, love me, love me, love me, I&#8217;m a liberal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Also when King went north into Illinois, you had this famous incident in Cicero, Illinois where you had this white mob come out and they were physically assaulting King and his fellow marchers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter: \u003c/strong>The secondary purpose of the march was to hold a prayer service in the lot of a service station, at the scene last May where a young negro was fatally beaten by four white youth. Perhaps 3000 people along the way, heckled the 200 or so marchers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>White counter protestor:\u003c/strong> Back to the jungle! Back to the jungle!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And King was then blamed for bringing the violence into the Chicago area. And, in fact, King&#8217;s message after that was, &#8220;We only unmasked the violence that was there. We didn&#8217;t bring the violence.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I feel like there was such an analogue to the times in which we&#8217;re living now where black people who rise up to protest against the killing of black people by police are then blamed for any police violence that takes place, whether it&#8217;s in Ferguson, Baltimore, or places that we don&#8217;t even know about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Right, right, again repeatedly when King starts to talk about conditions, let&#8217;s say in New York City, right? After the 1964 Harlem Uprising, King is talking about a civilian complaint review board, he&#8217;s talking about needing to reform the police and New Yorkers won&#8217;t want anything to do with that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The biggest civil rights demonstration of the 1960s is not the March on Washington, it is a school boycott that happens in February, 1964, here in New York City.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> Malcolm X, what brings you here today?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Malcolm X:\u003c/strong> Well, I&#8217;m out here to see the successful expose of the New York City School system. It proves that you don&#8217;t have to go to Mississippi to find the segregated school system. We have it right here in New York City.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> After a decade of parents, students, civil rights activists have tried to get the New York City Board of Ed to come up with a comprehensive desegregation plan and they&#8217;ve continued to stonewall and say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t, this is not a problem here.&#8221; And we have committee after committee, and so, basically for a decade after Brown, nothing has happened in New York.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so finally, in February of 1964, they decide to have a school boycott. About 460,000 students and teachers stay out of school, so this is almost twice the number of the March on Washington.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A month later, in protest of this, about 15,000 mostly white mothers march over the Brooklyn Bridge in protest of a very modest school desegregation plan that the Board of Ed is floating.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>White female protestor: \u003c/strong>What we believe that we can prove much as our own opponents that use the same tactics, we feel that we have as much as right as they with justice — these are our civil rights that we&#8217;re taking advantage of them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Pictures of that march end up being played over and over as Congress is debating Civil Rights Act. One of the things the Rights Act does is the ties federal money for schools to school desegregation. But Northern and Western liberal sponsors of the bill write in a loophole for their schools, which is evident the time, Southerners are furious about this, that basically says school desegregation shall not mean, you know, having to change racially imbalanced schools. Because that&#8217;s what northerners call their schools: racially imbalanced schools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Over and over, you see northerners unwilling and angry and furious when sort of the lens comes on their own practices.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok, fine, Martin Luther King was an unrepentant radical, I get that. But don&#8217;t ruin Rosa Parks for people. She was a tired old seamstress who refused to give up her seat on the bus and it sparked an entire movement because she did that. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Right. Except, no. So, Rosa Parks has this huge life what she will call a life history of being rebellious, that really begins in her 20s when she meets and marries the person she describes as, &#8220;the first real activist I ever met.&#8221; And that&#8217;s Raymond Parks. They fall in love. They get married. And Raymond is working on Scottsboro. This is 1931.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Scottsboro is nine young men, ages 12 to 19, get arrested for riding the rails. Basically, they&#8217;re riding the train for free. These are young black men. But in the midst of this arrest, police also discover, in a neighboring car two young white women doing this. And that charge quickly changes to rape. These young men are quickly tried and all but the youngest, who is 12, sentenced to death.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Lead Belly – “Scottsboro Boys”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, this local movement grows in Alabama to try to prevent the execution of these young men. And Raymond Parks is one of the local activists on the ground working on that movement. They get married in 1932, and she joins him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By the 1940s, she&#8217;s wanting to be more active. She&#8217;s galled by the fact that black people are serving in overseas in World War II and they can&#8217;t register to vote at home. She wants to register to vote. So, she goes to a local NAACP meeting, she&#8217;s elected secretary that very first day, she&#8217;s the only woman there. And she will spend the next decade with one of Montgomery&#8217;s most militant activists, a man by the name of E.D. Nixon, transforming Montgomery&#8217;s NAACP into a more activist chapter. Working on issues of voter registration, and issues that we would consider criminal justice. The wrongful accusations and convictions of black men and the unresponsiveness of the law to white brutality against black people, in particular, white sexual violence against black women.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, she spent more than a decade, when we get to that day in 1955, working and trying and over, and over, and over, and largely they get nowhere. They can&#8217;t get convictions or they can&#8217;t even get indictments. She manages to get registered to vote because she tries over and over, but most black people in Montgomery don&#8217;t, and can&#8217;t. You have to take a test but that test is different for white people than for black people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 1945, she&#8217;s angry. She&#8217;s convinced she should register. So, she writes down all the questions and all the answers on her test, because she&#8217;s thinking about filing suit. Now, just, where we are in history, this is ten years before she&#8217;s going to make her bus stand. So, the notion that Rosa Parks comes out of nowhere, you know, her feet are tired, or this or that, bears no relation to Rosa Parks&#8217; actual life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rosa Parks:\u003c/strong> The time had just come where I had been pushed as far as I could stand to be pushed, I suppose. They placed me under arrest, and I wasn&#8217;t afraid. I don&#8217;t know why I wasn&#8217;t, but I didn&#8217;t feel afraid. I had decided that I would have to know once and for all, what rights I had as a human being and a citizen even in Montgomery, Alabama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How does this happen? Because it certainly has happened with Martin Luther King, and it certainly has happened with Rosa Parks, and it certainly has happened with the broader civil rights movement. There has to have been some tactical decision made by people in positions of authority to revise this history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Or is it just a collective sense of denial that then, you know, snowballs into this huge avalanche of bullshit? How did this happen?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> So, I kind of began to locate this with Reagan&#8217;s flip-flop around the King holiday. Basically from the minute that King is assassinated, John Conyers introduces a bill for a federal holiday for Martin Luther King. A couple years later the SCLC delivers a petition with 3 million names on it. No action from Congress. There&#8217;s huge resistance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Throughout the 1970s, people are trying to get Congress to act. They won&#8217;t act. I think couple things happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One, in trying to convince Congress, what you see is the images of King are getting more universalized. Right? Stevie Wonder writes the song, &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; King, right? It&#8217;s sort of how American King is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; by Stevie Wonder]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Meanwhile Reagan, in 1983, he&#8217;s about to run again, he&#8217;s getting some criticism and he&#8217;s worried about keeping moderate white voters. And he comes to see the idea of signing the bill for the King holiday as useful to show kind of how progressive he is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster: \u003c/strong>Why have you changed your mind now about the holiday for Dr. King? Why are you willing to sign that legislation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ronald Reagan:\u003c/strong> Because I think, I think this has become so symbolic of what was a very real crisis in our history. And a discrimination that was pretty foreign to what is normal with us, and the part that he played in that, I think the symbolism of that is worthy of this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Up to this point, he comes in saying it&#8217;s costly; he comes in saying he can&#8217;t rule out that King was a communist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Reporter:\u003c/strong> Mr. President, Senator Helms has been saying on the Senate floor that Martin Luther King, Jr. had a communist associations — was a communist sympathizer. Do you agree?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RR:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;ll know in about 35 years, won&#8217;t we?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Then, in 1983, he doesn&#8217;t veto the bill. The change is he starts to see how this could be politically useful for him, and we start to see in the language that he uses this mythology about how the civil rights movement, in many ways, proves how great America is. Or, so this idea that I talk about in my new book, of America as a kind of self-cleaning oven. Right? That the civil rights movement, we were destined to have a great civil rights movement because we&#8217;re such a great country. Right? And this just shows like all the progress we&#8217;ve made. And I think we see a similar thing with Rosa Parks. Right? Both in the national funeral rehab for Rosa Parks following her death in 2005, less than two months after Hurricane Katrina. Why do we have a national funeral for Rosa Parks? Partly it&#8217;s to paper over those much more unsettling images from Katrina that are raising these questions of enduring racial injustice and so, a funeral for Rosa Parks sort of saying, &#8220;Look how far we&#8217;ve come, right? Look, look who we are! This woman who was denied a seat on the bus! Look, she&#8217;s now in the capital, right?&#8221; And I think the ways the civil rights movement is now used as a kind of tale of American progress and it makes us feel good about ourselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that reaches this apex with the election of Barack Obama. Right? There&#8217;s all sorts of movement symbolism, right? And that this is the dream being fulfilled and there&#8217;s a kind of feel-good nature to that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think there&#8217;s a way that we all like to think we do the right thing and it&#8217;s so hard to do the right thing. It is excruciatingly hard to act in the moment. It&#8217;s excruciatingly hard to act again and again and again and again, which is what the story of the rights movement is. It&#8217;s not: one day you sit down and the people rise up. It&#8217;s like: you do it over and over and over for years, and then you get fired, and then you have to leave your home, and then you have to do it more, and you&#8217;re super poor, and you, you keep fighting, and it&#8217;s just, you know, and fighting and fighting for like 60 years of your life. That&#8217;s Rosa Parks&#8217; story, right? It&#8217;s not one day on the bus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And yet Rosa Parks is often cited as a personal hero of both Democrats and Republicans, alike, even in the Republican presidential campaign, when Trump emerged victorious in one of the debates, when they were talking about the $20 bill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Right. And so, I mean, in this sort of crazy, absurd moment, the second Republican debate, they get this question, &#8220;Who would you pick on the $20 bill?&#8221; Trump, Rubio and Cruz all say Rosa Parks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Marco Rubio:\u003c/strong> Rosa Parks. An everyday Americans that changed the course of history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Ted Cruz:\u003c/strong> Could be Rosa Parks, she was a principled pioneer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> For three hours, I think my daughter Ivanka, who is right here. Other than that, we&#8217;ll go with Rosa Parks. I like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wow!&#8221; I think that we&#8217;d be tempted to say, &#8220;They don&#8217;t know who she is, right?&#8221; And I think that&#8217;s absolutely true. But it&#8217;s also like how interesting that just sort of saying the name of Rosa Parks becomes politically useful. I mean I think we saw that a few months ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What did Trump take to the Pope? He took first edition copies of all of Martin Luther King&#8217;s writings. Right? An extraordinarily gorgeous present. I would like to take that to the Pope, too. Right? But, it&#8217;s like Donald Trump, whose policies sort of stand really against why King is writing about in those books, and yet there he is like trundling to the Vatican with his first edition copies of Martin Luther King.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your new book that&#8217;s coming out in January is called &#8220;A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History.&#8221; Maybe you could give another example you know from the upcoming book of this kind of misuse of history that you&#8217;re writing about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Last summer, as the protest after Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were killed by police and we see this upsurge of protests all around the country, and we see Atlanta&#8217;s Mayor, Kasim Reed, basically talk about how Atlanta is the home Martin Luther King. They believe in free speech, but then to justify this massive police presence that we&#8217;re seeing in Atlanta, but also all across the country he says, you know —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mayor Kasim Reed:\u003c/strong> And Dr. King would never take a freeway.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> And you&#8217;re like: what do you think the Selma to Montgomery March is? What? They&#8217;re not marching in somebody&#8217;s field. That&#8217;s a freeway, right? This is what the civil rights movement was. It was disruptive. It was meant to disrupt civic life, government life, commercial life, one of the things that I find sort of ironic, is all of this like, &#8220;We want you to be more like Martin Luther King. This constant telling of young people, &#8220;Be like King, be like King.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think what this history shows is, &#8220;Be careful what you wish for.&#8221; Because if, you know, what it means to be like King is disruptive protest. What it means is understanding that U.S. domestic and foreign policy are linked. What it means is calling out not just sort of Southern conservatives but Northern liberals. What it means is making a moral and religious witness against racism and poverty and interlinkages between those two in the United States. What it means is getting arrested over and over and over, 30 times, right? What it means is having to call out your allies. What it means is using a whole variety of strategies that people call violent, that are actually disruptive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, when people say to young people, &#8220;Be more like MLK,” what I want to say is: “Be careful what you wish for.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jeanne Theoharis, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JT:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jeanne Theoharis is the author of &#8220;The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks&#8221; and her forthcoming book, which comes out in January, is, &#8220;A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that does it for this week&#8217;s show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Intercepted is a production of First Look Media and The Intercept.

It was like the White House’s own bizarro version of the civil rights movement. This week on Intercepted, acclaimed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates talks about Trump, Obama, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, the NFL, and much more. “The Color of Money” author Mehrsa Baradaran breaks down the roots of economic apartheid in the U.S., the ongoing impact of slavery on black communities, and offers a provocative history of black banks. The Egyptian government has launched a targeted assault on LGBTQ people, following a Cairo concert of the popular band Mashrou&#8217; Leila where rainbow flags were waved by the crowd and gender conformity challenged from the stage. We speak with the band’s lead singer Hamed Sinno about being queer and Arab in the Middle East and Trump’s America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We&#8217;re doing a live show this Friday, October 13, at the Hot Docs Podcast Festival in Toronto.

And this is episode 31 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re going to have to do something with Obamacare because it&#8217;s failing. Henry Kissinger does not want to pay 116 percent increase in his premiums, but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. And it&#8217;s actually getting worse. It&#8217;s getting worse by the — by the minute.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump welcomed back to one of the most heinous war criminals in US history, Henry Kissinger, back to the White House on Tuesday, and Trump used this horrid villain as his poster boy for trying to overturn Obamacare and strip millions of people of healthcare.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, we should say that Kissinger supporters are equal opportunity war crimes apologists. Hillary Clinton desperately tried to get Kissinger to endorse her in 2016 and other Democrats have heaped praise on Kissinger over the years. Let&#8217;s be clear here Henry Kissinger is the man who played a crucial role in the killing of more than a million Vietnamese, and the saturation bombing of Laos, the genocide in East Timor. This is a man who helped overthrow governments, supported murderous death squads and holds the distinction of being one of the premier killers of the modern era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump wheels out the almost-lifeless corpus of Kissinger for a White House photo op and complains that Kissinger doesn&#8217;t want to pay more for his healthcare. How many of Kissinger&#8217;s victims are around to weigh in on the quality or cost of their health care? And also Henry Kissinger is hardly eating cat food and living check to check. No, for his atrocious war crimes, he has been awarded this noble statesman status, celebrated by Democrats and Republicans alike.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it is fitting that Trump used Kissinger as his latest model for health care reform, because it&#8217;s all based on a big lie. Just like Kissinger&#8217;s status is based on the big lie that wars make us great or that Vietnam was something other than a massive string of war crimes. But maybe there is truth in there somewhere: that the preferences of Henry Kissinger mean more than the health of poor and working people in this country, or the lives of the people who die at the hands of U.S. wars.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I want Henry Kissinger to keep his government-subsidized health care, but in a prison cell. Because that&#8217;s the only thing Henry Kissinger should be a poster boy for.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Eric Reid:\u003c/strong> This is really disheartening when everything that you were raised and everything I was raised on, was to be the best person I can be, to help people that need help, and the vice president of the United States is trying to confuse the message that we&#8217;re trying to trying to put out there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This weekend, Vice President Mike Pence spent a quarter of a million dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to very publicly make clear that his boss, Donald Trump, will pull out all the stops, make unlimited resources available, tirelessly raise public awareness around the clock to confront the growing menace of black athletes protesting police killings of black and brown people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Pence clumsily staged his version of a protest on Sunday when he pretended to be going to an NFL football game in Indiana. The press corps traveling with him was told to wait outside, because the Secret Service believed Pence might only be inside for a brief time. Sure enough, when the national anthem began and players knelt in protest, Mike Pence and his wife left the stadium. Hilariously, Pence posted a photo on social media celebrating his walk out. But it turns out that it was a picture from 2014 that Mike Pence had just reposted. These guys seriously cannot do anything without screwing it up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anyway, Trump, of course, couldn&#8217;t contain himself and he rushed to take credit for Mike Pence&#8217;s walk out, tweeting that he had ordered Pence to leave if such disrespect was shown to the flag. Now, the reason I&#8217;m bringing this up is to make this point: Mike Pence&#8217;s little stunt wasn&#8217;t really about confronting disrespect for the flag or the national anthem. This was about Trump showing his base that he won&#8217;t tolerate such actions from black people even if they&#8217;re millionaires.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump also privately intervened in the operations of NFL franchises, as his buddy Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, made clear when he said that Trump had reminded him of the NFL game ops manual. Now, that&#8217;s a document that dates back to the Vietnam War era, and it says that players should stand for the national anthem and remain silent while doing so out of respect. Jones said that he would bench any players who disrespect the anthem or the flag.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jerry Jones:\u003c/strong> The policy and my — my actions are going to be that if you do not honor and stand for the flag in a way that a lot of our fans feel that you should, if that&#8217;s not the case, then you won&#8217;t play.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump celebrated Jones&#8217;s position by tweeting, &#8220;A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will bench players who disrespect our flag. Stand for anthem or sit for game.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This isn&#8217;t really about the NFL or the flag. This is about white supremacy. Trump&#8217;s position on this speaks to a long tradition in the U.S. of powerful white people despising disobedient or uppity black people. Contrast Trump&#8217;s passion and his time commitment to attacking black athletes protesting police killings with how he talks about the white supremacists in Charlottesville, where a neo-Nazi ran over and killed a woman, where white supremacists gang beat an unarmed black man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Very fine people — on both sides.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Contrast Trump&#8217;s obsession with black athletes disrespecting the flag and anthem to how he talks about John McCain&#8217;s time as a prisoner of war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But, you know, he lost. So I never liked him as much after that, because I don&#8217;t like losers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I personally do not believe that John McCain is a war hero. Vietnam was a massive war crime. But what&#8217;s interesting here is that Trump, who scrupulously avoided going to Vietnam, by the way, is attacking a guy who was a prisoner of war and then screaming constantly about black athletes disrespecting veterans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Contrast Trump&#8217;s dedication to eradicating black athletes protest to his response to the ongoing horrors in Puerto Rico. His administration just let the Jones Act waiver expire, making it even more difficult for aid to reach Puerto Rico. I mean listen to how Trump talks about his now-infamous throwing of paper towels at hurricane survivors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> They had these beautiful soft towels. Very good towels. And I came in and there was a crowd of a lot of people and they were screaming and they were loving everything, and we were — I was having fun. They were having fun. They said, &#8220;Throw them to me. Throw them to me Mr. President.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump responds to black and brown people in a radically different way than he does to white people. Puerto Ricans in his mind should have been grateful to him, and any Puerto Rican who complains is dirt. He can call John McCain a loser for getting shot down in Vietnam, but black athletes can&#8217;t exercise their First Amendment rights. Black athletes are sons of bitches, but the white shooter in Las Vegas is probably smart, according to Trump. This is a pattern that only the willfully ignorant can deny. And this isn&#8217;t just about Trump at home. Trump&#8217;s foreign policy it&#8217;s also rooted in white supremacy. He&#8217;s re-escalating the war in Afghanistan. He&#8217;s opened a criminal spigot to Saudi Arabia to keep the bombs dropping on Yemen. He has eased the restrictions for the U.S. military on killing civilians. He&#8217;s considering expanding CIA drone operations. And Trump is threatening to wipe North Korea, a country of 25 million people, off the map.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Part of the horrors emanating from Trump involves style, and some involve substance. President Obama was a belligerent war president. So was Bill Clinton. So is Donald Trump. Trump is not really taking the war positions he is because he&#8217;s Donald Trump. He&#8217;s doing what American presidents do, albeit with some tweaks and differences here and there. But Trump says things that are horrifying. He openly lies. He chooses to inflame situations. So how much of Trump is who he is and what he believes and how much of it is how he does it and how he speaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Journalist and author Ta-Nehisi Coates recently wrote an article about Trump that has sparked a lot of discussion and debate. The title alone is very provocative: &#8220;The First White President.&#8221; It&#8217;s a fascinating read and it addresses the ways in which the eight year presidency of the first black president, Barack Obama, was seized on by trying to make his way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the piece, Coates write, &#8220;It is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true—his ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power. To Trump, whiteness is neither notional nor symbolic but is the very core of his power. In this, Trump is not singular. But whereas his forebears carried whiteness like an ancestral talisman, Trump cracked the glowing amulet open, releasing its eldritch energies. The repercussions are striking: Trump is the first president to have served in no public capacity before ascending to his perch. But more telling, Trump is also the first president to have publicly affirmed that his daughter is a &#8216;piece of ass.'&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Howard Stern:\u003c/strong> By the way, your daughter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> She&#8217;s beautiful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> Can I say this — a piece of ass?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Coates continues: &#8220;that is the point of white supremacy — to ensure that that which all others achieve with maximal effort, white people (particularly white men) achieve with minimal qualification. Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that if they work twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump’s counter is persuasive: Work half as hard as black people, and even more is possible. Trump truly is something new — the first president whose entire political existence hinges on the fact of a black president. And so, it will not suffice to say that Trump is a white man like all the others who rose to become president. He must be called by his rightful honorific—America’s first white president.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ta-Nehisi Coates has a new book that has just been released, it&#8217;s a collection of his writings, and it&#8217;s called, &#8220;We Were Eight Years in Power&#8221; and he joins me now. Ta-Nehisi, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ta-Nehisi Coates:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think a lot of the focus and I think a lot of people on social media, when your piece first came out, you know, on “The First White President,” I think there was a lot of people commenting on it that didn&#8217;t actually read it. That was the sense that I had in the kind of initial blast. I was just talking to Ai Wei Wei here, and he was saying that, that to him Donald Trump is, is only more of a kind of extroverted version of what we&#8217;ve seen from the United States presidency in general.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I&#8217;m wondering if you see it that way or if you think that — I mean, clearly we have a guy who is saying things and emboldening people that it&#8217;s sort of become like, you don&#8217;t really do that publicly you know if you hold political office. You have the Roy Moores of the world —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> But he&#8217;s a profane version of what a real American attitude to the rest of the world actually is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and that was his perception. This is guy who hasn&#8217;t been in the United States for decades, he&#8217;s in China, he&#8217;s under assault there. That was his perception. I&#8217;m just wondering what you think of that analysis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I am ill qualified, but that feels true. I would never have thought of it like that. I just — it&#8217;s funny, you know, even like, when um, the book ends, sort of with an international perspective. Because I think that one of the things like, when you&#8217;re in a group that&#8217;s oppressed, there&#8217;s a tendency sometimes to take comfort in that oppression. The idea that it makes you noble or exempts you from certain things, as opposed to seeing how maybe you&#8217;re tied to other folks&#8217; oppression.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, so like, you know, in this version of &#8220;The First White President,&#8221; there&#8217;s a part where I talk about, you know, to the rest of the world as Americans, maybe, you know black people are white too. Do you understand? Like, in the concept of whiteness, as, as power, as oppressive power. We are all, you know, actually kind part of this. You know? And so hearing that, I&#8217;m not shocked. I&#8217;m not shocked. That&#8217;s a fascinating concept. You just blew my mind.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, you’re writing the Obama presidency was you know, they say, &#8220;a prophet is not someone that that sees the future but understands the times in which we live.&#8221; And I always felt reading your writing about Obama that it was so unusual because it felt like the kind of analysis that you would get years removed from, you know, the reality that we&#8217;re in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the sort of flip side of Obama on a policy level was that when it came down to the brass tacks, this was a guy engaged in initiating new wars, sustaining old wars, you know, filled with contradictions. I think a lot of people projected onto Obama who they wanted him to be, when in reality a lot of his policies were sort of center or center-right in the context of American politics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How do you reconcile that, the kind of minutia of what he did to build U.S. empire and the wars and all of that stuff, with his, sort of, you know, symbolic importance, but also who he was as president. It&#8217;s so different than for Trump. Does it matter?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it does matter but I think you&#8217;re asking an important question. And I think, frankly, I am always called to that kind of reconciliation when I study any other president. How do I reconcile the fact that Lincoln, you know, ultimately led the war that emancipated four million enslaved African-Americans, and, at the same time, you know, very much held white supremacist attitudes, advocated the colonization of black people out of this country? How do I reconcile Lyndon Johnson, pioneer in terms of civil rights legislation and the Vietnam War? How do I reconcile Franklin Delano Roosevelt for his efforts in strengthening the social safety net yet doing that on the back of white supremacy in the south? It&#8217;s tough man, it&#8217;s tough.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, very interesting, I was in Chicago doing some reporting. Right? I was arguing with these guys you know, in the academy with a bunch of historians. I love arguing with historians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I said, &#8220;Obama is a great president.&#8221; And they go, &#8220;Ohhhh!&#8221; And they all get upset, right? And I said, &#8220;Well, you know, the question you have to ask is “by the scales of what the American presidency is, not he&#8217;s a great person, but in terms of what the American presidency is, he&#8217;s a great.&#8221; And, you know, we&#8217;re going back and forth, and I said, &#8220;Okay, so who&#8217;s a great president?&#8221; And one of the professors says, &#8220;Lyndon Johnson, without Vietnam.&#8221; (laughing) She was joking.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> She was trolling you. Real nice troll.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> But one of the other guys said something really profound. I said, &#8220;Listen, you have to say what, you know, within an American context, given the populace we have given that we can&#8217;t elect a new people, what would be great.&#8221; And he said, guy said to me — he was a philosophy major, which I should I&#8217;ve known, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not invested in those categories. I reject the whole argument.&#8221; And I left thinking about that the whole night, like, maybe the presidency, and I haven&#8217;t fully fleshed this out, but maybe the presidency in terms of what it is, we shouldn&#8217;t think of people who have that job as great, ever. Like, it&#8217;s not possible to be great. Implicit in it are certain things that are not possible to salute. Are not possible to reconcile.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Obviously, I advocate participation in the democratic process, but maybe that should always be done with like, a kind of skepticism of any sort of, you know, rah rah rah, et cetera. It was actually sort of a profound point. I haven&#8217;t, as you can tell, fully decided what that meant. But it was a check. It definitely stopped me from calling him great. You know, it was an important check.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, it was interesting, when Obama was running first time, when he was running for president, you had to look for it because it wasn&#8217;t part of the stump speech. But Obama has had this incredible grasp of history in this country that generally is thought of like what Howard Zinn wrote about and not the kind of examples that a presidential candidate gives on the campaign trail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He talked about, you know, the workers on trains in this country, the porters, and others and the strikes and the idea that some leaders were saying at the time in the 1940s, “you have to make me do it. You have to hold me accountable.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, you know, you always got this sense, I always got this sense that Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Isn&#8217;t that myth, too? I think that quote is —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yes! But this is what I&#8217;m saying, this, the examples that Obama would give and this is what I&#8217;m getting at —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The examples that Obama would give, had this kind of foundation to them that was different than, big mainstream political candidates typically would have had. But if you peel back the layers of them, they&#8217;re almost like a neo-liberal version of Howard Zinn, rather than like any attachment to a truly radical different idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, no I think in the book, the phrase I use, “conservative revolutionary,” by which I mean, the fact of a black president was revolutionary but he&#8217;s an establishmentarian. He&#8217;s conservative, clearly, you know, he believes in American institutions. He believes that, you know, America is, and he would just say this unadulterated, a force for good in the world. He probably would have more nuance making that argument than George Bush would have, if you sat down and had him talk about it. But he believes in — I&#8217;ll just say this — in the country in a way that I probably don&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The question I always have, though, is what is possible for an American president? And maybe that takes me back to the logic that I should have rejected in the first place, but where are our expectations for what it should be? And I&#8217;m not saying in terms of what should we protest and what should we not, which should we object to what should we not. But his foreign policy, specifically — were you surprised? I wasn&#8217;t really surprised.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No, and, in fact, I mean I, but maybe. I mean you and I are from the same generation. I mean part of it was that I came of age or became an adult when Bill Clinton was president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the first war that I covered was under Clinton. I was in Iraq in the 90s. I was in Yugoslavia in the 90s. And I think maybe because I ended up becoming a reporter, I didn&#8217;t really view Bush as this epic departure from Clinton. I mean clearly Iraq was a, you know, a mass killing on a mass scale, but Clinton was, you know, Noam Chomsky called it &#8220;the new military humanism,&#8221; you know he wrapped everything in humanitarian — you know, these cruise missiles that were raining down, it was for humanitarian purposes. But when you look at it, it&#8217;s a pretty consistent — there&#8217;s never been some huge circuit breaker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Well isn&#8217;t the difference that Bush, especially after 9/11, had a vision of remaking the world. Now, obviously Clinton would rain down bombs on people, but the idea, for instance, of remaking Yugoslavia, you know, wasn&#8217;t present.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think also those guys, I mean not to get too off subject, but I think they were haunted by Rwanda. I think that that looms large in a lot of peoples&#8217; minds and the price of not intervening and what that could look like.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No doubt about that. And you had the neoconservatives, I mean people throw that around a lot right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But these were people that spent the eight dark years of the Clinton era preparing a game plan for the day they took power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m wondering what you think of the kind of recent embrace of George Bush, but also people like Bill Kristol and David Frum and others, by kind of liberals or Democrats, et cetera, because of the Trump-Russia stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> It makes me uneasy. You know, it makes me uneasy because, I mean I guess on one level, they are taking a somewhat courageous route in the sense that they&#8217;re not, simply — because there’s people who are clearly not doing this, like a Tucker Carlson or a Dan Nesters, who I actually believe know better. You know, and are just, you know, turning it into a complete racket. So, you know, we can at least say that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I don&#8217;t think it should obscure the fact that we have profound differences with folks. I just don&#8217;t think that that should be missed or forgotten. I certainly don&#8217;t forget it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George W. Bush:\u003c/strong> States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I mean I struggle with this on a personal level, too. Like, is there any forgiveness that anyone should ever lend David Frum for writing the “axis of evil&#8221; speech?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I mean, if, certainly, I mean, I probably could imagine some things he could — you know what it would require? &#8220;I was completely wrong about that. It led to a massive human humanitarian catastrophe and I just really, really shouldn&#8217;t have done it. And it will affect all the work I do going forward. I will always remember that.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think people should necessarily be banished from public life. But they need to be straight up, you know what I mean? They need to be really, really straight up about their mistakes and not act like this was some game of chess or something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think you’re right on the money there. I hadn&#8217;t thought about it in the way you just put it, but I think that&#8217;s the biggest part of what I find offensive about the whole thing is that it&#8217;s like, &#8220;All is forgiven.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like a million people died in that war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And it&#8217;s like, no I&#8217;m sorry, I’m not going to just retweet you talking about the latest Russia shit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> No, no, no, but we just don&#8217;t see it. I keep talking about this piece because it really bugged me out, but Evan Osnos did this piece on North Korea in the New Yorker. And I think one of most effective things he was able to show — obviously, you know, North Korea, totalitarian, authoritarian state — but they have a memory of the Korean War that Americans just have no idea about. You know Curtis Lemay raining down bombs. And that means something to them. And we just have no access to it. Do you know what I mean? And maybe to some extent it was always this way, but in terms of, you know, the notion that what is wrong with Iraq is the number of American soldiers who died, that&#8217;s what was actually wrong with Iraq. That sort of perspective, it&#8217;s scary. You know, it&#8217;s scary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well and you see with the take a knee protests, and it&#8217;s now so far away from the original point that Colin Kaepernick and others were making. It&#8217;s been co-opted by some, or it&#8217;s been characterized as an attack on the troops by others.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s a long history in this country of connecting the dots between what the American government says it is and what the American government does around the world. And we&#8217;re, nowadays, we&#8217;re called to some kind of bizarre superficial patriotism or else we&#8217;re against the troops. And it&#8217;s like: what&#8217;s wrong with saying what the troops did is criminal? Them being sent there was criminal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> You can&#8217;t say that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and especially, black men can&#8217;t say that even more.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> And here&#8217;s the worst part. There was nothing he could have done. So, initially, people don&#8217;t remember this, but he was actually sitting down on the bench, and that was thought to be disrespectful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He went and talked to a veteran, who apparently had some politics, and said, &#8220;Listen, I get it, you want to protest one thing. What might make this go over better is if you took a knee.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>People forgot that taking a knee actually was the compromise. It was the attempt to show some level of respect, you know? There&#8217;s nothing he could have done differently that would have made this OK.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We should have a split-screen, though, of Kaepernick or other people on their knee, although, I mean, Kaepernick is not on a team right now, and then like, any random white guys sitting on their couch with their feet up during the national anthem. Like, &#8220;That&#8217;s your respect for the national anthem.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Right right right. That’s true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think it&#8217;s in part, because they are black men doing that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> No, that&#8217;s definitely it. And then there&#8217;s the entire labor politics of the NFL, which I think play into this. People do not think of those guys as workers, despite the fact they basically play for free all through college, you know, bash their brains in, you know, subject themselves to all sorts of, you know, illness, and injury.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean, again, to the point of like your brain, like literally, your brain being affected, go into a league in which you have,workers, who are making millions, but, you know, effectively working for people who make billions. And then are told to be grateful. In a way where the owners, you know, are not told to, you know, be grateful. They have all sorts of problems in terms of health care and once they get out of the league, after basically preparing their entire lives to do one thing and transitioning out. It&#8217;s very hard for black men or black people in that position to make a case for themselves as actual workers. No one sees them that way. These are people who are lucky, who should be grateful. You know? I mean it&#8217;s obscene.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah and that is a lot of the pushback that&#8217;s written by, you know, the thought pieces and that&#8217;s basically the point: Why should we have sympathy for any of these, you know, multimillionaires?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> But they have sympathy for the owners.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. Of course.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> You know, I mean if you&#8217;re a billionaire, you know, no one sees, you know, Donald Trump as lucky, you know? I mean no one perceives Donald Trump as lucky, you know? I mean people perceive him as, you know, a really smart businessman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to ask you about reparations, but something you said about North Korea I think is relevant to this. You know, you were talking about how North Koreans still live with that memory of the U.S. role in destroying Korea, and also in that war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the United States, when these shootings happen, like we saw in Las Vegas, immediately the Sean Hannity’s of the world go to, &#8220;Oh, well look at Chicago.&#8221; And they talk about the murder rates in Chicago and the guns that are in Chicago. What&#8217;s interesting about all of this is, no one ever raises the psychological and economic impact that slavery continues to have to this day. Do you do you think that there is ever a time that we could have in our lifetime, where the political discussion of reparations would ever be on the table?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> The important thing is to say what that would look like and then, you know, we can answer the question that way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Most of the time when people conceive of reparations, they conceive of like a judgment from the Supreme Court or like Congress, you know, passing a bill to decide by the president. But I think much more likely to happen if this were to happen, would be a wave of smaller individual acts of reparations. For instance, you know, there was a reparations bill in the City Council in Chicago for police brutality. There have been reparations; I think it was in North Carolina, where they were sterilizing women. I believe in Virginia, also, when they shut down the schools during a massive resistance to Brown vs. the Board.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think what you would see is a growing consensus that in fact, government and private business on all levels of society, you know, colluded to put black people in certain situations. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, to pilfer and plunder wealth from those communities. And it would be a series of much, much smaller things. I don&#8217;t think it would be one federal act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Could you get to that in our lifetime? I don&#8217;t think so. I think the work of this, and I encourage people to think about this like it&#8217;s a multi-generational struggle. I think the work of this lifetime is to get people to at least acknowledge the case. You know, for there to be no doubt — one of the things I took a lot of heat over for &#8220;The Case for Reparations&#8221; was not outlining an actual plan. But that&#8217;s because people don&#8217;t believe the case. I mean the first thing is to get, actually, people to admit, &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re owed.&#8221; You know what I mean? And then maybe you can have a conversation about it, how do we actually, you know, remedy that debt?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I think that&#8217;s this generation&#8217;s work. I mean if we get, by the end of my lifetime, for people to say, &#8220;Yeah, you know, we really screwed you all.&#8221; I mean that would be serious, serious progress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why don&#8217;t we talk more in this country about why certain areas of this country are the way that they are, with housing, with economics —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> So, there&#8217;s a way that people see the Civil War. And the historian James McPherson calls it the violent football game theory of the Civil War, where there actually are no real principles at stake, where, you know Southern people acted honorably, Northern people acted honorably, they just had some sort of disagreement and then you know there was reunion. And, that was for the better, we&#8217;re sorry we had the Civil War.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And slavery is not included in that. Part of the period after Reconstruction, and real reunification of the United States, was telling a story. Telling, that story actually, telling the story of the violent football game. The South didn&#8217;t have to feel bad about doing anything; the North didn&#8217;t have to feel bad about doing anything, and expunging black people from the historical record. It is only within that generation of historians that came up in the 1960s, and a tradition of black historians who were basically completely ignored, it&#8217;s only, within, you know, the lifetime, you know, of historians who are still living right now, that people begin to see Reconstruction and Redemption after the Civil War for what it actually was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so I think, if I can be an optimistic and hopeful, that the case has not yet filtered down. You know what I mean? It took a long time to build that myth. Immediately afterwards, you know, the generals who fought with Robert E. Lee begin building this lost cause mythology, you know, and it, you know, crescendos with, you know, &#8220;Birth of a Nation&#8221; and &#8220;Gone with the Wind.&#8221; And people believe it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Such to the point that HBO is announcing this show &#8220;Confederate,&#8221; and they still don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s wrong. They just don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t get it. They don&#8217;t get why that&#8217;s wrong. And to some extent, unforgiving.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s like, when I heard Hillary Clinton during the campaign, you know, talk about you know, how bad Reconstruction was and if Lincoln was alive, and — and, the thing I had to remember, as wrong as that was, was that was probably the logic when she went to school. That was, you know, probably — and I&#8217;m talking about like, in the college, into her college years. That was probably what she was taught because that was, what the theory was. We just haven&#8217;t, we haven&#8217;t come out of the haze yet, man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hillary Clinton:\u003c/strong> You know, he was willing to reconcile and forgive, and I don&#8217;t what our country might have been like had he not been murdered. But I bet that it might have been a little less rancorous, a little more forgiving and tolerant, that might possibly have brought people back together, more quickly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We were just talking with, the other day, the historian Jeanne Theoharis, she has a book coming out in January about the sanitizing of the legacies of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, and she also wrote a biography of Rosa Parks, &#8220;The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks,&#8221; that&#8217;s phenomenal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You write about Malcolm X and I&#8217;m wondering what your assessment is of how Malcolm X appears in our discourse today and the way that he&#8217;s sort of referenced. He&#8217;s not often referenced in American politics, but in American culture Malcolm X is often referenced. What&#8217;s your analysis of how of how he is generally remembered these days?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Obviously he&#8217;s been softened and made accessible to broad groups of people. The question I wonder is, like, well, I mean, you know, I feel like I&#8217;m always asking this question. It goes back to the question about you know Barack Obama and the presidency: What is like the alternative? Does this ultimately happen to any, you know, sort of, revolutionary figure. I mean you really could make the same case about Martin Luther King. I mean people have forgotten that from the highest, at the highest levels of government, King was harassed until the end of his days. They think like, you know, him and Johnson and Kennedy were all great friends, and you know, they forget that they authorized the bugging, and the harassment. And so he&#8217;s been softened, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But if you&#8217;re going to have a national holiday for King, is this what societies do? Like, do they turn, you know, these revolutionary figures — like, do they have to soften them in order for them to gain the kind of acceptance that, you know, the people who follow him, black folks seeing him, actually want?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well in a bizarro world that&#8217;s sort of what happened with Obama at the beginning of his run. A lot of people projected onto him what they wanted him to be and I think that 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention was a very sophisticated piece of propaganda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I hated that speech.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No but it was a sophisticated piece of propaganda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> No, it was, it was. It really was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America, a Latino America, an Asian America. There&#8217;s the United States of America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Even, his October 2002, speaking against the war, but I do think both black and white people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> “I&#8217;m not against all wars.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m only against stupid wars, yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> I don&#8217;t oppose war in all circumstances, and when I look out over this crowd today, I know there is no shortage of patriots or patriotism. What I do oppose is a dumb war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But people would project on to him, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s the antiwar candidate.&#8221; But it&#8217;s a similar phenomenon that we&#8217;re — that&#8217;s happening with Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, but in a different realm. Right? Sanitizing them later. But with Obama, it was like, making him what we want him to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> You know, my greatest failure, as a journalist is that I think I&#8217;ve gone pretty deep on American society, but I don&#8217;t have comparisons across, in other societies. Are there other places where people have a realistic apprehension of their heroes? You know, where this is kind of sanitization does not happen or is myth, and all of the problems of myth, like a necessary element, in order to make a society cohere in some sort of way, in order, you know, so that we aren&#8217;t all like out in the streets killing each other?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s your answer thus far to your own question?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I hope that it&#8217;s not necessary. My intuition is that it is. But then I&#8217;m, you know, I guess I&#8217;m conflicted on that, because, I think, like, you know, this is a country that you know says that holds itself as the light of the world in terms of democracy, that believes that it&#8217;s ahead. And so I don&#8217;t know that the standard of — if that&#8217;s your logic, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re saying, you&#8217;re not just saying &#8220;We&#8217;re just one among.&#8221; You believe that you&#8217;re touched by God, if that&#8217;s what you believe, then I don&#8217;t know if that standard works. And certainly there&#8217;s a history of ideas, so it doesn&#8217;t mean that because all societies are this way, that society necessarily has to be this way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I don&#8217;t know. But I know in my work, it&#8217;s, in fact, even in the times interviewing Obama like, you know, when I would go and I would talk to him, I would always have to come home and face myself on that question: Okay, Ta-Nehisi, but you have to articulate some other way within the constraints of what the American populace is, within the constraints of what America itself is. You have to articulate some other vision. And they weren&#8217;t policy points where I could say, or things he did, specifically, like, &#8220;You could&#8217;ve done this, you could&#8217;ve done that.&#8221; But in a broader sense, in terms of what you&#8217;re talking about. I think you&#8217;re talking about something more, you know, global you know in terms of his policies. I don&#8217;t know man, I&#8217;ve got to tell you — I always had trouble with that. I always had trouble with that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s your impression in general of Bernie Sanders?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I think his race in 2016 was really, really important. I think actually having somebody in the race, in the primary, saying things that ten years ago people thought were unsayable in the Democratic party. Someone, you know, out and out, you know, especially you know in the wake of everything that happened in terms of you know, you know, the economy and the collapse and everything. Somebody out and out saying, &#8220;You know, these guys are villainous and they got away with something.&#8221; Somebody, you know, really saying that, somebody not just retreat to, you know, “too big to jail”.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think, and I believe in that, even if you know, as a critique, we shouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Unless you have a plan.&#8221; I actually, I don&#8217;t believe that. I think ideas are actually important.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I was, encouraged and incredibly heartened that he was in the race. I voted for him in the primary. In terms of my politics, I&#8217;m certainly much closer to him than I was, to Hillary Clinton. I think he should have more black and brown people around him. Maybe he&#8217;s fixed that, I don&#8217;t know. But certainly in the things I heard after the election, it&#8217;s —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I just want to be clear: I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s alone in this, right? I think this is actually across the liberal left spectrum. But you can&#8217;t say you&#8217;re ashamed of the Democratic Party&#8217;s ability to speak to the white working class and talk about how you&#8217;re from the white working class and then get on some kid who is talking about being a Latino, you&#8217;ve got to pick one. You&#8217;ve got to pick one. You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s identity politics when these people do it, and not, when you do it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I don&#8217;t even think we should adopt that language, which is really, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, conservative, right-wing language. I know there&#8217;s a critique on that in terms of leftists, but I don&#8217;t think we should even be in the business of adopting that language.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in conflict about being in favor of single-payer health care. Being in favor of a much, much more robust social safety net. Being aggressively anti-war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And frankly, saying you&#8217;re for reparations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, I understand why he might not say that. Like, I got that! In terms of what I wrote, what bugged me was the complete hand-wavy, you know, aspect of it. From somebody who was so imaginative. You know, if we&#8217;re going to be imaginative about those things, you know, be imaginative about these things, too!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the 1970s, the incarceration rate in this country was roughly about the same as it was in all other, you know, westernized democracies. I guess somewhere between 100 or 200 per 100,000. The last time I checked we were at about 700 per 100,000.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How are we going to get back to normal? You&#8217;re going to have to say some things that are not sayable right now. You know what I mean? You are going to have to think in some sort of imaginative way. And when you say those things, it will not be missed that a lot of those people are black. That just won&#8217;t be missed. It&#8217;s not even missed when you make what looks like, you know, sort of race-less or colorless or identity-less points without identity, that in fact a lot of black people, you know, will be helped. That is — there&#8217;s a reason why the ACA, you know, in Glenn Beck&#8217;s mouth became reparations. People see it. People see it! And so, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a fight that can be gotten away from.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I know some folks feel like I&#8217;m either/or. I&#8217;m not either or, to the extent that I stress race. It&#8217;s because I think it&#8217;s the missing thing in that platform that&#8217;s got to be picked up and directly engaged.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you think, though, that the Democratic Party has outgrown its value at all? If Bernie had, of course he would&#8217;ve gone down as the man who gave us Trump, either way, but he already he is blamed that way by a lot of Hillary&#8217;s people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I don&#8217;t see him that way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I know you don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m saying, that&#8217;s how Team Hillary presents it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> She says it in the book.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, yeah, of course. But if Bernie Sanders had said, &#8220;You know what, this is too corporate of an agenda for me, it&#8217;s too soft on all of these things, I&#8217;m going to run an independent campaign,&#8221; it would&#8217;ve shattered the Democratic Party.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> It would&#8217;ve. It would&#8217;ve.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But would it have been a bad thing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You think so?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I do, I do, I do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump won anyway, so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, Trump won anyway. As I understand it, what happened was he realized too late that he could actually win. I think that&#8217;s what happened. I think initially, you know, there was some sense, &#8220;Listen, I don&#8217;t want to, you know,&#8221; to the country, I think his sense was, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to injure anybody, I don&#8217;t want a Republican to win.&#8221; And then it became clear he actually had quite a bit of appeal. And that people were, you know, a lot of people actually holding their nose voting for Hillary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think that, like our system of government, in general, is limited. There was a great column about a week ago in The Times from Michelle Goldberg on the possibility of minority rule and, man, that scares the hell out of me. I mean, I just the very — take the Electoral College, take the ability, take the fact that we don&#8217;t have a national voting system, you know, which you have in other countries, that States can, you know, make their own laws and, you know, mess around with the districts. What scares me is — you know, I guess we&#8217;re already here! I mean, what am I saying? You know, what scares me is if we&#8217;re going to get there. Where, you know, on a presidential level, you know, and I guess to some degree on a Senate level right now, you don&#8217;t really have the will of people actually being represented.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That is a bad, bad scenario. That&#8217;s a really, really, really bad place to be. What I&#8217;m trying to say is I think the whole set-up is really problematic and will increasingly become so, especially as the demographics of the country change. You combine that with the systemic problems that were already there: I don&#8217;t know. I see trouble.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Last two questions. First, what are you reading these days? I know you&#8217;re on tour. What are you reading, and what are you listening to?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> I am reading Ron Chernow&#8217;s great Ulysses Grant biography. It&#8217;s excellent. Exceptional. I highly, highly recommend. It&#8217;s long, but that don&#8217;t even feel like, I think it&#8217;s one of the —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>See, it&#8217;s interesting, you were just talking about reconciling? And Grant is an interesting guy because he was born into an abolitionist family. He marries, you know, into a slaveholding family. He goes off, you know, and serves in the Mexican War, comes home, he&#8217;s dirt broke, can&#8217;t do anything, can&#8217;t make a living. And through his wife&#8217;s family, he inherits an enslaved African-American, and within a relatively brief period, I don&#8217;t know when, he goes to the courthouse and he says, you know, he emancipates the slave.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I was thinking the other day, this is like maybe the most heroic thing like I&#8217;ve seen somebody do in their private life, who, you know went on to become president. Because he was dirt broke and that was a lot of money he just sort of he — like, he didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I want to be rid of this, so I&#8217;m going to sell it. I&#8217;m going to sell this person.&#8221; He parted with that, and, despite what I said about greatness, I love that dude. I love how he was completely underestimated. I love how people thought he was stupid when, in fact, he was a great, you know, reader and ended up being a great writer, wrote arguably the best presidential memoirs. So, I&#8217;m really loving that book.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In terms of what I&#8217;m listening to, I&#8217;m listening to a ton of Marvin Gaye right now. I know that&#8217;s old but I&#8217;m listening to a lot of Marvin Gaye.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TNC:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ta Nehisi-Coates is the author of the new book, &#8220;We Were Eight Years in Power.&#8221; We&#8217;re going to post the full interview I did with Ta Nehisi-Coates later in the week.

The Egyptian government, it seems, is afraid of the influence of the Arab-American band, Mashrou&#8217; Leila.

Now back to the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Okay. We are back here on Intercepted. And if you really want to talk about violence in Chicago and you want to be honest, then you need to talk about economics, white supremacy, housing, jobs and the ongoing impact of slavery on modern-day black communities. Abraham Lincoln was from Illinois and when he signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, the black community in the United States owned less than one percent of the country&#8217;s wealth. Oh, but that was a long time ago! We had the civil rights movement and a black president! That&#8217;s in the past. Wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Today, 153 years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, the percentage of black ownership of wealth in the United States has barely budged. Now, there&#8217;s a lot of academic debate and discussion about why this is. But in the mainstream of American discourse, particularly when we are looking at shootings in places like Chicago, we almost never discuss the historical roots of why things are the way that they are. We never really take on that question why. American presidents, politicians, activists, others — they&#8217;ve all offered up plans to change this, ideas to change this. And it often revolves around supporting black entrepreneurs or black businesses or black capitalism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the years following the killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson and other killings that spurred uprisings from people, the hashtag #blackbank has spread fast. Its aim is to advocate that black people take their money to black banks, spend their money in the community, keep their money in the community. Here&#8217;s hip hop artist Killer Mike:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Killer Mike:\u003c/strong> You can go tomorrow, and you can say, &#8220;Until you as a corporation start to speak on our behalf, I want all my money, and I&#8217;m taking all my money to Citizen&#8217;s Trust, and I will deal with the inconvenience of an ATM charge.&#8221; In fact, we can sit down Citizen&#8217;s Trust, and we can tell them some of those smaller banks, we gonna get you to waive your ATM charges, if we move this amount of money to your bank, then what we&#8217;re going to do is to start, to divert money away from the system. And this works. I&#8217;m saying: &#8220;Take your money out of this dog&#8217;s hands, out of their paws, take your money.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now what Killer Mike is saying sounds like a sound idea. But is it? An incredible new book offers an enlightening look at the history of black banks and their complicated position in the U.S. And it raises profound questions about the enduring legacy of slavery reconstruction and whether the deck is already stacked so heavily against black-owned banks, that they may actually reinforce the economic apartheid that has defined American society from the very beginning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That book is called &#8220;The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap&#8221; by Mehrsa Baradaran. She&#8217;s a professor of law at the University of Georgia. I will also say that this book is about so much more than black banks. It&#8217;s really an exhaustive investigation into the history of economic racism in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mehrsa Baradaran joins us now. Mehrsa, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mehrsa Baradaran:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Start at the beginning and sort of talk about the economic conditions of black people in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yes, so blacks came as a labor, but they were also capital. I mean they were owned and they were sort of liquid property. Right? You could have a, I call the slave-backed securities. They were collateral for loans, they were used, they were bought and then they were, you could get credit on your slaves. So, this was, you know, this was property like we dealt with any kind of property. And they built tremendous fortunes for those who own the slaves. And so not only could you extract the labor, but you could also use it as, you know, anyone would accrue wealth, sort of intergenerational wealth, you would pass it on to your children and you would have this asset that would accrue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even after the Civil War you have a system set up, you know, through convict-leasing, through sharecropping, through the black codes, all sorts of you know Jim Crow-era laws. Pre-Jim Crow, through Jim Crow, to extract labor from blacks without giving them rights, and especially without giving them the ability to own capital, to own property.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Because if blacks are, you know, they own property and they own capital, then they become self-sufficient and become, you know, they can have self-determination in their communities and you can&#8217;t extract the labor. So, a lot of the law of the legal codes of the South and then the North were built on this idea of keeping blacks as labor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Just briefly explain Reconstruction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> So, Reconstruction is, you know, we freed the slaves and now, you know, they need to be integrated into the American capitalist society. And it was very much about, you know, land, really. I mean the premise was that you worked and there&#8217;s just been this huge injustice and now we&#8217;re going to give them land they can cultivate themselves and plant and be self-sufficient.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, Reconstruction was, you know, there was a Freedmen&#8217;s Bureau, there was a job training, there was, you know, schools and all of that. And, and it was you know violently overthrown by the South. It was, you know, first through just you know lynch mobs and things like that and then through politics you know that white supremacists got control of the state houses and you know you would get lynched for being a Republican, for voting Republican in the South.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the question of land was what really divided and radicalized the southern terrorist, I guess you&#8217;d call them, right? Who overthrew this new institution, so Reconstruction was meant to encompass a bunch of these different things. What ended up happening, Johnson vetoes it. Andrew Johnson, and the one thing that he doesn&#8217;t veto is the Freedman Savings Bank. That remains and this is the story that I start the book off with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Freeman Savings Bank was this philanthropic, charitable venture. It was supposed to be, you know, instead of getting land, we&#8217;ll give you a savings account. I mean they weren&#8217;t getting paid fair wages, but you work and save up your money and you&#8217;ll buy land yourself. And what happens is you&#8217;ve got this huge pool of capital and the freed slaves really were attracted to this bank because they assumed that it was backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. And the reason assumed it was because the bank notes came with the flag draped all over them, and Abraham Lincoln signed it into law, the bank was created by Congress and the stated purpose of it was to safeguard the deposits of the Freedmen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, and so they brought in these deposits, and then it was this big pool of capital the owners were white, that managers and there was a broad railroad speculation happening. Henry Cook was the manager of the bank, of the deposits and he, his cousin, Jake Cook was a railroad speculator. And so, he put all the money, the deposits into railroad bonds. And they were all lost.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, half the deposits were lost and as the bank is sort of you know fumbling, they bring in Frederick Douglas to save the bank and restore morale and get the freed slaves to keep their deposits in the bank. And Frederick Douglas lends the bank tens of thousand dollars of his own money. And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, something&#8217;s wrong here.” Right? And so, he tells Congress — he&#8217;s not a banker, right, Frederick Douglass — he tells Congress, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to shut it down. So that we can save what deposits we can.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Congress shuts it down. No one&#8217;s ever prosecuted. I mean there&#8217;s a huge financial theft, looting, really, of these savings funds and it never goes prosecuted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who had their money in the Freedman&#8217;s Bank?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> It was hundreds of thousands of free slaves. I mean it was millions of dollars. In today&#8217;s money, I think is something like $1.5 billion dollars of money. And this is — imagine how hard it was to get that savings at the time and so you know it really sows distrust of institutions, of banks. But it also, you know, through the propaganda campaign, sows the seeds of banking in the black community\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it&#8217;s not — you know, within the decade, blacks are like, &#8220;Hey forget, forget the federal government. No one&#8217;s going to help us. We&#8217;re going to help ourselves.&#8221; And so, these other black banks start popping up during the Jim Crow era, usually you know linked to a church or fraternal society. Some, you know, social or cultural or religious organization the black community that is developed to meet the needs of the freed slaves. And so, a huge slew of black banks are created during this era and that shifts the focus of the community inwards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this is, the, you know, the height of black banking then is after that Great Migration. You know, 1910, 6 million blacks move from the South to the North, they move into the cities, and they&#8217;re segregated immediately. Right? So, they say, you know, welcome to New York. Go to Harlem and stay put. You know, through violence and then through zoning and through racial covenants and all sorts of stuff there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that is also another blossoming of black-owned banks, because, you know, these are vibrant communities, at least before the Great Depression, they&#8217;re making tons of money and so they need a place to put them. And so, there&#8217;s hundreds of black banks formed during this time. And the Great Depression wipes those all out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What happened during the crash in the early part of the 1900s and the subsequent Great Depression with black banks and black communities?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so I mean, they say, you know, when Wall Street catches a cold, Harlem gets pneumonia. And essentially, it is that. Because these communities are segregated and there&#8217;s concentrated poverty. And so, when you have concentrated poverty and the shot goes through the system, it is felt much more acutely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know during the era of heavy crashes, black banks are, of course, failing much more so than white banks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Why? Because they&#8217;re, it&#8217;s not that technical but a little bit. So, the banks have liabilities that are deposits and they have assets that are loans and then they participate in this money multiplier effect. So, you know, in order to have a good healthy bank, you have really good assets, pretty good deposits. And so, the way black banks, the reason why they&#8217;re so much weaker than white banks is because of the concentrated poverty of the community. Their liabilities, their deposits are small and they&#8217;re volatile.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, if someone is poor, they only have a couple hundred dollars to put in a bank. That is good for the person, they can save it. But for the bank, that&#8217;s costly. For a bank to be run with a bunch of small deposits, they have to hold a lot more in reserves. That means they can lend less, that means they&#8217;re more likely to be run. So, black banks are, you know, there&#8217;s more runs on black banks. There are more failures.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then, on the asset side, you lend on a home. And so, the way that this, you know, to be profitable is, you want to lend a lot. Black banks can&#8217;t lend a lot because of that deposit weakness, but they also, when they do lend on a black property, black properties historically, even to today don&#8217;t rise in value because they are black properties. Right? People, once a neighborhood sort of flips into becoming a black neighborhood, those houses decline. So, the first few families that buy into a white neighborhood have to pay premium, the black families, and then their house declines.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, these banks are holding these loans that are frozen on their balance sheets and they&#8217;re underwater, essentially. So, they can never offload them. So, black banks become almost like a sieve through which the money leaves the community, so they can&#8217;t hold this money. And that was the premise of the whole system.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, as I say in the book: you can segregate people, you can&#8217;t segregate their money. And, so, you know, really becomes frustrating for these institutions, they cannot make a profit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You write about several very prominent historical figures: Booker T. Washington Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, up till today, the hip hop artist Killer Mike from Run the Jewels, who were big advocates of black banking and keeping your money in black banks and this idea of black capitalism as a way of kind of uplifting the community. What&#8217;s your critique of that? Like, what has been flawed about it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Because I think this is one of the most fascinating parts of your book, you don&#8217;t paint it as, &#8220;These were all stooges for, you know, for the white man.&#8221; It&#8217;s much more nuanced than that and was based in ideas that had, at their heart, some sense of actually wanting to collectively lift up the community. I want you to talk about those figures and sort of some of the analysis you did on that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Right, so, Booker T. Washington was like, &#8220;We will get wealthy and we get respectable and then we will get political power.&#8221; We don&#8217;t need to vote, you know, you don&#8217;t need to give us anything, just, you know, blacks are going to do this ourselves and then we will achieve the status and then you will accept us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That never happened. So, he has kind of a naive sense, in a way, of doing this but he&#8217;s also the leader that&#8217;s chosen by these capitalists? Carnegie, Rockefeller, they fund his organization the Tuskegee Institute so I don&#8217;t think he is a cynical person. I think he actually — I have read his biography, his autobiography. Where he, I think does, is very optimistic and very naive about what it is. But also — he is the leader that the South could tolerate at the time. I am sure there were other leaders pushing for other stuff that never made it to a pulpit, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He&#8217;s the leader that gets selected to you know bring voice, but I think this whole theory that you know we will get economic power first and then political power, that remains through other leaders and the thing that I&#8217;m saying in this book is you can&#8217;t get economic power without political power. Because the way that wealth is created in America is through policy, is through credit, usually, that the government insures and passes out, through these laws. So, I think there is this misunderstanding.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Donald Trump is the living embodiment of that. I mean no, I mean really.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And he&#8217;s been remarkably idiotic with his money and is just constantly failing upwards but, you know, if you were to give a huge lump sum of money to a business school grad who is African-American, I mean odds are they probably would do better with this than Donald Trump in terms of the decisions they make, but Donald Trump also has the added benefit of being a white man from a very wealthy family.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Right. Yeah. And this is especially becomes true post-New Deal. So, post-New Deal. In this century, the 20th Century, to the extent that any one in the middle class or blue collar class — right, whatever we&#8217;re calling that now — gained intergenerational wealth, it was through the FHA through the VA through the GI bill. Those institutions, those credit policies were created post-New Deal. They undergirded the American middle class. They ensured mortgages. You got student loans from it. All of this stuff. And it only went to whites.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After those New Deal-era things are created, white banks blossom. I mean the golden era of American banking is from 1934 to 1970. You had hundreds of thousands of new banks created to peddle these FHA mortgages. I mean there were, your loans were risk-free, because FHA was guaranteeing them. These suburbs were being built. There&#8217;s, you know, wide economic prosperity, except when one looks at the ghetto: where these loans didn&#8217;t go. So, you have two credit systems that diverged drastically during this time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s not just home loans, it&#8217;s not that the blacks in the ghetto, not only can they not buy in the ghetto because the redlined maps, the FHA says you may not lend to into the ghetto and get these this insurance, but they can&#8217;t move out because our racial covenants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, so you&#8217;re putting people, you know, locking them up. And I call it ghetto because it, you know, it&#8217;s not a black community. They didn&#8217;t choose that place; it was chosen for them. And then, within that community, there&#8217;s a different credit market. So, whites are now with the home loans, we have credit cards. Revolving credit, low-risk, low-interest essentially.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And blacks are still on installment credit, installment credit is incredibly costly. It comes with, you know, repo men and cops, so you&#8217;re getting your refrigerator and you&#8217;ve got to pay monthly and you&#8217;re paying way more for that refrigerator than someone who buys it on credit in the white suburbs will pay for it. Right? And then you have to deal with like, it getting collected and the hustle that&#8217;s going on around that. And so, this builds and the tension is — comes to a boiling point during, after the civil rights laws. And this is what&#8217;s — what&#8217;s a real sort of ironic was after 1964, 1965, and you know, these big monumental civil rights laws are passed, you have urban rioting, Congress meets to discuss what&#8217;s happening, and one of the things that they come up with is, well, that they realize as they&#8217;re looking at the rioting and the testimony, is that these protesters were going after the lenders. And they were saying things like, &#8220;Burn the books.&#8221; Right? They would go to their lenders, who were, they saw them as their exploiters. These were the oppressors, right? Everything I&#8217;m buying is through these loans and it was an oppressive debt. And so, they&#8217;re going at these stores.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other thing they realized is they&#8217;re leaving out black businesses. So, they&#8217;re not, you know rioting and looting there. And so, the response, the legislative, sort of, policy response is: let&#8217;s just throw more black businesses into the ghetto, that&#8217;ll be the solution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let&#8217;s have black banks lend because black banks surely won&#8217;t exploit. Right? But the point is that there is a different credit market and it was created by federal policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The specific challenges rooted in the history of black people in this country also applied to black banks. That, that it&#8217;s, they&#8217;re not starting from a level playing field with other banks and maybe you can explain, you know, why you draw the comparison between the individual and the bank, and what you mean by it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I mean, the same circumstances that create the need for these banks which is segregation, racism, and concentrated poverty, that&#8217;s why we have black banks. Those same forces cripple these banks. Right? These banks cannot overcome these forces because banks, it&#8217;s a misunderstanding of what banks do for us to expect them to create this wealth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, banks do create wealth. Right? But you need that money multiplier to work and this is what Hamilton understood early on, is banks and the government work together. And he calls, you know, banks allow silver and gold, which was that money at the time, to acquire life. Right? So, banks do, you know, augment money and he talks about that, and that is true, but it doesn&#8217;t work in a segregated economy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I contrast this with the Italians and so, I get this, well, why did it work for Italian banks and Jewish banks and German banks? And it only worked for them once they became white. You know Italians assimilated first, and then their banks came.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, one example is the Bank of Italy. The Bank of Italy starts in San Francisco and it&#8217;s lending to talents who are also discriminated against and somewhat segregated, never to the extent of blacks, blacks were the most segregated population, historically. But they then get FHA loans and GI Bills, right? The Italians become white for the sake of credit, which is all that matters in my opinion, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They become white and the Bank of Italy branches all across California and Bank of Italy becomes Bank of America, the biggest sort of bank in the country. That starts out as an Italian bank. And so, you know, I use that as an example of, &#8220;Sure, you can do it. But first you need that credit and Bank of Italy expands through the FHA consumer credit market, which is enabled by this policy.&#8221; It&#8217;s only post-New Deal that any of these immigrant groups have a chance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To me, the most interesting part of the research was what happened with the Nixon era. And so, Nixon is the one who adopts the black banking framework and institutionalizes it into the federal government. So, back to the riots, right? You&#8217;ve got riots, you&#8217;ve got real violence, and then you started to get a white backlash to civil rights where whites are now saying, &#8220;That&#8217;s enough. We&#8217;ve done enough. You&#8217;re on your own.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then there&#8217;s, you know, some communism abroad and so we&#8217;re fighting that. Nixon rides this white backlash into office and there are two proposals on the table, right? The civil rights leaders are saying integrate or give reparations. And a lot of the leaders are saying, &#8220;Give us reparations. Like, we will just do it ourselves.&#8221; And reparations is — I&#8217;m using broadly, to say either capital or some way to just infuse capital or credit into the black community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Was the argument at that time, when people were advocating and I realize you&#8217;re using a broad definition of reparations, were they linking it to the economic conditions that you&#8217;re describing that go all the way back to slavery? Was that the political argument that they were making?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, you&#8217;ve got Martin Luther King and Carmichael and others saying: “This is white welfare that&#8217;s been happening, and we need to remedy this.” So, that there is that conversation happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Nixon even backs an initial plan that would include, actually, federally funded financial institutions in the ghetto. And Nixon backs that as a candidate, and then, so he&#8217;s got to decide: what does he do? He&#8217;s not about to propose integration because he&#8217;s got the Southern strategy, and the South is, just, there&#8217;s no way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He essentially the adopts black power. You have a direct quote of Nixon using the phrase.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yes! Yes. Right. So, he links his civil rights agenda to the black power cause.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Richard Nixon:\u003c/strong> Aspects of black power are very disturbing to us, because it means revolution, it means violence. But other aspects of black power are very constructive, because it means that black people, they want to stand on their own feet. That they want to have black banks, and not just go to white banks. They want to have black businesses and now just go to the white businesses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> What he means is: You own the problem now. We&#8217;re going to do anything for you. So, when he means, like, black ownership, he means ownership of the poverty.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, he really comes into power with black capitalism as his, you know, institution, so he creates this government apparatus. And he&#8217;s half-hearted about this. I mean George Romney is his HUD adviser. I think this is a story that needs to be told about what happens to the GOP from George to Mitt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But George is, you know, Nixon calls him Mr. Integrationist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Was governor in Michigan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Governor in Michigan and becomes Nixon&#8217;s HUD advisor, head of HUD.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Housing and Urban Development.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Housing and Urban Development. And Johnson, right before leaving office, like days after Martin Luther King&#8217;s death has been trying to put in this housing bill. Right? To equalize housing and to allow for integration. 1968, his parting sort of gift gets this bill passed, so there&#8217;s this window, where we could really have, you know, equal housing and George Romney is pushing this. So, he tries to do this open communities thing in Warren, Michigan, where we&#8217;re going to put black projects in white communities, so we can integrate. We can have schools that are sharing resources, we can have community resources that are the same. And Nixon pushes him out. I mean Nixon, you see these memos, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Stop this guy. Right?&#8221; Like, just get him out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he tries to get him to resign several times and so once he&#8217;s out, no other HUD administrator has had an integration plan since Romney. So, that&#8217;s off the table.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then we have reparations, that&#8217;s off the table. And so, what they give is black capitalism and what this essentially means is they create the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, all these little agencies, and really what it turns out is they just want stories of successful businesses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in within the black community, there&#8217;s also this business revival as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that&#8217;s also rooted in the mythology, I mean Horatio Alger, but also the mythology of the around, surrounding Booker T. Washington&#8217;s ideas too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Exactly. Yeah. I will say, one critic at this times, Andrew Brimmer, Andrew Brimmer is the first black Federal Reserve chairperson. He&#8217;s an economist, very smart guy, Harvard educated, son of a sharecropper. And he calls black capitalism &#8220;snake oil&#8221; he says this is a hoax, don&#8217;t fall for it. You, know he&#8217;s not heeded. Nobody has heard of Andrew Brimmer, probably because he&#8217;s just not, doesn&#8217;t become this black leader. Right? But he&#8217;s an economist. He knows how banks work. And he tries to spell it out: this is not going to work. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Nixon&#8217;s half-hearted about it anyway. But by the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who was he saying that, who was he telling?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> To the black community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How was he telling the black community that it was snake oil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> He writes in Ebony. You know, he goes to the black community. He also tells Congress. He tries really hard to do this. But it&#8217;s sort of out of their hands by this point. By the end of the decade, no one wants to push civil rights any longer. And then so this black capitalism framework lasts, and it is, you know, the SBA loans, it&#8217;s, affirmative action comes out of black capitalism and Nixon, money to the black banks, this whole structure that he creates.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then something odd happens to it. It becomes about — it starts as a remedy to poverty, to this unequal system to segregation. It starts as a response to these ghetto riots. And it becomes about diversity. So, it quickly gets watered down into this colorblind, you know, myth that we&#8217;ve been living. We rewrote quickly the history of Martin Luther King and the one, sort of, sentence we took out of the speech was, &#8220;I have a dream that you can&#8217;t judge me by the color of my skin.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So now you have John Roberts in 2004 saying the way to stop discriminating based on race is to stop discriminating based on race. In other words, don&#8217;t worry about people&#8217;s race. Like, we don&#8217;t care anymore. We don&#8217;t see it. So, then this black capitalism framework turns into minority businesses, and female-owned businesses, and now we&#8217;ve got this infrastructure and it still lives on. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Clinton bolsters this. Obama bolsters this. Trump! His new deal with black America: credit to black businesses. So, it&#8217;s the same framework: no integration, no reparations, you know, a nice soft response about Martin Luther King. Every president has done this, including Trump. &#8220;Oh, Martin Luther King&#8217;s a great guy. Frederick Douglass, he&#8217;s starting to be noticed more and more, blah blah blah.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know, pat the old leaders on the head, and do this black business framework. And so, we have this infrastructure now and black banks get you know technical assistance from their regulators. And, and really what started out as a response to economic inequality and poverty has become this, &#8220;We need representation and we need, you know, black banks and women banks and Asian banks.&#8221; And not to say that we don&#8217;t, we certainly do. But it got, the message got watered down. And the way we talk about it now is not the way it was talked about initially.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s interesting because your book is, the title of it is: &#8220;The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap.&#8221; This last part of it, the racial wealth gap, I think is one of the most fascinating strands of the book. To me, this was kind of jarring when I read it. I knew it was horrendous — I didn&#8217;t know how bad it was though. I mean, it&#8217;s extreme, like sickening to the n\u003csup>th\u003c/sup> degree, of percentage of wealth owned by black Americans versus white Americans. The housing statistics that you give, the lack of any progress even in just basic percentages over the course of like a couple hundred years in some cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So maybe you can lay out some of the statistics that you uncovered or that you cite.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so, something like a third of black families are negative wealth, so no wealth at all. Whites on average, 13 times the amount of wealth. I mean some have even 20 times, I&#8217;m being conservative here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The most staggering statistic is after the Emancipation Proclamation is signed, blacks own .5 percent of the nation&#8217;s wealth. This is obvious, right? They were capital and they can&#8217;t own it now. Today it&#8217;s like 1.5, 2 percent. So there really hasn&#8217;t been that much progress. But that makes sense if you understand how other people make wealth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the way any of us have wealth is through property. Property ownership that is appreciated and then we can then build that into stock ownership. And yes, income, but income also is related to wealth. So, I think it&#8217;s stems from wealth if you grow up in a wealthy community, you can go to a good school, you can go to a good college you can make a good income. If you grow up in a community where the schools are crap, you have no social capital, you don&#8217;t know people who know people who have jobs. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of that stuff is interrelated: crime, debt collection, prison, bail. All of that stuff gets entangled in this lack of wealth. Blacks are four times more likely to get sued for debt, right? They&#8217;re more likely than whites to get pushed into this awful bankruptcy regime that is not the more debtor friendly one. There&#8217;s all of these statistics and I&#8217;m trying to get at the root of it. The root of it is they they&#8217;ve never had this buffer of wealth. This buffer of wealth, and we don&#8217;t think about it because it is that. It&#8217;s a buffer, you don&#8217;t face it. But at the end of the day, like, you go to your mom&#8217;s house, you can get, get ten thousand dollars from a relative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the thing with being in a community of poor people from generations of poor people is you don&#8217;t have that. You don&#8217;t even have that person that you can call for a couple thousand dollars to get you out of a bind. So where do you go? You get a payday loan. And what does that do? That deprives the wealth that you already — whatever little wealth you had, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mehrsa Baradaran, thank for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MB:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much for having me. This is great.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mehrsa Baradaran is the author of the new book, &#8220;The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Donald Trump has made clear that he has a very deep affinity for the Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. And the events of the past few weeks in Egypt have likely solidified that adoration. Egypt is, right now, in the midst of a violent campaign targeting LGBTQ people. And the country is considering new laws that could result in fifteen-year prison sentences for &#8220;homosexuality.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In recent weeks, there have been raids, arrests and surveillance targeting gay Egyptians and it seems to have been sparked by a concert of the Lebanese-American musical group Mashrou&#8217; Leila. The group&#8217;s lead singer Hamed Sinno identifies as queer. And the band&#8217;s songs play with themes of gender, sexuality and identity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mashrou&#8217; Leila has been banned in Jordan, and when they performed in front of a massive crowd in Egypt late last month, rainbow flags were out in force. As video clips of that concert spread online, loyalist Egyptian media outlets began attacking the concert, began attacking Mashrou&#8217; Leila, and began attacking the very existence of gay people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A primetime TV host in Egypt said, &#8220;homosexuality is a crime that&#8217;s as terrible as terrorism.&#8221; Others in media called for psychiatric investigations into people who defend gay people. And Egypt&#8217;s Supreme Council for Media Regulation has now banned discussion of LGTBQ issues. Oh, and they also called homosexuality a &#8220;shameful disease.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, clearly, the Egyptian regime doesn&#8217;t need a concert by Mashrou&#8217; Leila to implement it’s attack plan on gay people. But it does show you the power that music can have against fragile dictatorships.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I recently spoke to Hamed Sinno, the group&#8217;s lead singer — by the way, he&#8217;s an American. And we talked about what it&#8217;s like being a queer Arab in the Middle East and in Trump&#8217;s America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hamed Sinno:\u003c/strong> So, I am a second generation Arab-American with North African descent and Hijazi descent. I am half-Lebanese, half-Jordanian. I&#8217;m queer and probably not typically gender conformant, I think, for the most part, especially by Middle Eastern standards of what masculinity is. I don&#8217;t think these things function in a way where you&#8217;re one thing in the Middle East and then you&#8217;re another thing in the States. I think the nature of, I don&#8217;t want to say identity, because I&#8217;m not really a big proponent of that discourse in general, but as just being anything, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think when I was growing up I always had this sort of like romanticized idea of, &#8220;Oh, well, I&#8217;ll move back to the States once I&#8217;m done with college, or once my mother doesn&#8217;t need me, or whatever it is,&#8221; and that I could just move back here and have this sort of flah-zi-dah life where I can just be myself.&#8221; And then the moment we started touring here and just seeing the amount of homophobia, let alone Islamaphobia, it&#8217;s kind of crazy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Mashrou’ Leila — “Roman”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When it became clear that Donald Trump was going to be president, I&#8217;m wondering if it affected the writing of new songs for you at all, or if you managed to separate your art and your work as a musical artist from what&#8217;s happening in this country and who&#8217;s going to be in charge of it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> Right. To be honest we haven&#8217;t really been writing since the election. We&#8217;ve been really busy touring with the last album.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The last album we wrote during the two years after my father died. So, a lot of the content on there was about, sort of, being in clubs and just really trying to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol. But, at the same time clubs in Lebanon are, well clubs anywhere I guess, are necessarily a very political space. I think if anything, unfortunately Orlando is testament to that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A lot of the content on the album was stuff that I assumed was going to be too personal for audiences to relate to. But we did it anyway. But it&#8217;s just a lot of stuff about masculinity, and the necessary violence that comes from masculinity and just being in clubs and doing a lot of drugs and trying navigate your social life and trying to operate outside of language, falling into the pitfalls of language being necessarily gendered, when you&#8217;re trying to interact with anyone. Trying to dance and what that means and how therapeutic that can be, but also how destructive that can be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, you know, I really, really thought that was going to be too personal for anyone to relate to. And then we were on tour here and Pulse happens and then suddenly this really weird, almost perverse thing happens, where you realize that you&#8217;ve written these songs with one particular intention but you have no control over what an audience does with that. And that what an audience reads into your work is as valid as what you intended for it to mean, and what people make of it is, in a lot of cases, I think even more valuable and more important.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How do you play with words, with what you&#8217;re talking about, with gender conformity and masculinity and feminism, as you describe it? How do you play with words in Arabic in your music?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> Look there&#8217;s this thing with Arabic that&#8217;s quite special, which is that every word you use in Arabic is necessarily gendered. So, you can&#8217;t sort of say &#8220;person&#8221; without automatically saying whether or not that person is male or female. You can&#8217;t say good without “good” also being male or female.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But there&#8217;s a lot of fun to be had in sort of messing with these things and messing with certain things that are assumed to be extensions of feminine or masculine subjectivities. Right? Like the role of the housewife, which, unfortunately, is still assumed to be a necessarily feminine thing in the Middle East.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, there&#8217;s this thing that&#8217;s quite funny also with Arabic, which is historically the way the music has worked is that when men have sung love songs, they&#8217;ve always addressed other men, at least in the way that they conjugate things. Because of this horrible, horrible assumption that implicating a woman in some sort of public romantic expression is shameful, right? That it would bring that woman shame. So, men have always sung to other men without that being assumed to be queer. So, I think just being able to mess around with these things when you&#8217;re obviously doing the same thing, you know, you&#8217;re using that same canon but you&#8217;re also explicitly saying that this is coming out of a queer body and a queer vocality, kind of messes with things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Tayf&#8221; by Mashrou&#8217; Leila plays]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> I really, really, really like the lyrics for Tayf. The English translation for that is Ghost. So that the law in Lebanon criminalizing homosexuality, which is law 354, is actually a law that criminalizes &#8220;all sex against nature.&#8221; Right, so obviously you can tell from the fact that nature is used, that this was a law that was instituted by the French, given that we were colonized at the time, that Europeans, you know sort of post-Enlightenment, were starting to replace God with nature as though that were less of a subjective rubric.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So the fun-zies in that song is that I was trying to use anthropomorphization as a linguistic tool to try and challenge the idea that anything can or can&#8217;t be natural.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Tayf&#8221; by Mashrou&#8217; Leila plays]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> The first verse of the song is about someone sort of navigating the street and trying to, actually, like suck the marrow out of life by sort of naturalizing a lot of things that are necessarily urban, which is just how we live, like traffic lights and neon signage and electricity and all these things that are obviously, you know, sort of &#8220;unnatural&#8221; but that don&#8217;t seem to be problematic for a lot of people. So suddenly, you have someone crying neon and sucking electricity and as though you know, sort of an electric pole were a bone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Tayf&#8221; by Mashrou&#8217; Leila plays]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> And then for the chorus, I found this incredible text by Sylvia Plath called &#8220;Mushrooms.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sylvia Plath:\u003c/strong> We are shells, we are tables, we are meek, we are edible.

Right? That goes, sort of unnoticed by the Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean, really, the people in power. The right-wing people in power are, on a daily basis, doing so much stuff to try and pull back, right, any progress that the queer community has made over the last 20 years. But then all these things are conveniently sort of problematized those same people when looking at the other. And you know what?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;m so tempted to make it sound like this is sort of an event, right? Or that there&#8217;s anything special about this but historically. That&#8217;s just been the way we have done things. The way US foreign policy has operated as far back as, you know, US foreign policy has existed, has been to throw stuff on the other to try and buttress this idea that we are better as Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s ridiculous. I mean, just looking at the numbers of what has been happening on the ground in the States for the last, I mean it doesn&#8217;t even go that far back, for the last year. The amount of suicides within the trans community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and murders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> And murders. The amount, I was going to say, the amount of hate crime in general, when it comes to people who are non-normatively gendered or non-normatively identified sexually or who are racially underprivileged and, to add to all of that, you get like neoliberal economics going haywire. And this perverse sort of intersection of politics and economics, in a way that really resembles what has historically happened in Lebanon, actually, surprisingly enough, to have sort of this big capital actually govern this explicitly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But all of that is sort of ignored when we&#8217;re looking at ISIS. We&#8217;re going to say we have a problem with ISIS. I mean, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I obviously have all sorts of problems with ISIS. Right? And all sorts of problems with ISIS killing queer people. But we&#8217;re going to ignore the fact that this is happening on sort of American soil, when we&#8217;re talking about ISIS and say, &#8220;This is why we&#8217;re attacking them&#8221;?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean listen, let&#8217;s not bullshit ourselves, we&#8217;re attacking the Middle East because of oil and because of money and because it&#8217;s great for the economy. And, because, yeah I mean it could go on forever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and I do think that there is a radical crusader mentality that permeates some parts of the right, and Islam is used as a prop to make a point about something unrelated and they don&#8217;t give a flying fuck about what happens to gay people in the Middle East, unless it&#8217;s consistent with their agenda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They don&#8217;t care about women&#8217;s rights unless it can be used to justify their agenda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> Of course. Look, I mean the epitome of this, I think like this iconic moment was I think a couple years ago. Israel had these pink fighter jets in support of, I think, it was breast cancer month or something like that. And I&#8217;m looking at this stuff like, literally Palestinian woman have zero access to medical care. They don&#8217;t care if they&#8217;re woman or not. So, this idea that suddenly you have this colonial entity that is using some sort of feminist agenda to make itself look like they care, like they&#8217;re liberal, and democratic and they care about identities and the variant struggles that we have and blah blah blah blah blah, when on the ground that&#8217;s obviously not what&#8217;s happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The thing that gets really messy with the way the U.S. uses Islam, in particular, as a discourse, is that it reinforces this idea that there is such a thing as one Islam, which is disastrous. Right? Because even right now with the different Islamic communities that are acknowledged by each other, right? There&#8217;s Shia Islam, there&#8217;s Sunni Islam within each of those there is a bajillion different kind of, like several different denominations with very different discourses, but there&#8217;s also an entire history of the Islamic institutions silencing a lot of Islamic movements that have split from what the institution has said is Islam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So then, when you get this sort of global superpower saying, &#8220;well, this is what Islam is,&#8221; they end up allowing those Islamic institutions to silence people on the ground as being less legitimate. When, you know, historically we know there have been schools of Islamic thought that have been very radically feminist. That have, we know that, at the moment, there are a bunch of mosques that allow for gay marriage. That there are people that have called for a separation, within Islam, of state and religion. That there are people who have said, &#8220;Well the Qur’an is one thing but Sharia is a whole other ballgame, and we don&#8217;t need to follow that.&#8221; It&#8217;s called Qur’anism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All these things get ignored, and it just ends up reinforcing the idea that there is one monolithic version of Islam which historically is the way the institution has maintained its own power, which is essentially a power given to privileged men.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s disastrous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When you get up every day, what keeps you going and what gives you a broader sense of hope? Or do you have hope?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HS:\u003c/strong> I think every now and then we get these, sort of, messages from kids, essentially. Getting messages from kids saying, &#8220;Thank you for being out.&#8221; Or &#8220;thank you for talking about X or Y&#8221; or whatever it is, I mean, it&#8217;s not always gender stuff. But I mean I know when I was growing up I had a really rough time sort of feeling like I belonged to anything because there was very little cultural production in Arabic, be that music or film or whatever, that addressed the things that I was struggling with, like my sexuality, like my gender expression, like my political viewpoint, like my feeling like I can&#8217;t belong to a country that&#8217;s that elitist, and racist, and money-driven. And I guess every now and then you get these messages from kids that make you feel like you are doing that for them and that makes a lot of the bullshit okay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Amen to that.

We continue to be blown away by the level of support that so many of you, our listeners, have offered us to keep this show going strong, to keep it on the air and to keep it free for the vast majority of people who listen to this program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>More than 1,300 people have already become sustaining members of this show, sustaining members of the Intercepted podcast. We have some fantastic thank you gifts, including laptop stickers — Intercepted laptops stickers, one of my favorites is the Intercepted hoodie. You also can get digital downloads of all of our cold opens. And we&#8217;re very proud of the creativity that goes into this show. Our producer, Jack D&#8217;Isidoro really working around the clock and cutting those cold opens. You can get a digital download of our favorites — of all of those show openers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Join the more than 1,300 people who have offered their support to the Intercepted Podcast. They&#8217;ve become sustaining members of this show. And what that means is that we&#8217;re going to be able to bring on more staff, expand what we do. We want to be able to do Intercepted reporting out in the field, and in order to do that, we need to increase our staff. We&#8217;re working on a shoestring budget right now, and with a very skeletal staff. We&#8217;d love to be able to bring on some more producers so that we can expand what we do on this program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As we&#8217;ve said from the beginning, our commitment on this show is to tell the truth, to hold the powerful accountable, and to give voice to the voiceless. If you support that mission, if you appreciate this show, then we ask you to join the more than 1,300 people who have already pledged their support. You can do so by going to theintercept.com/join. That&#8217;s theintercept.com/join. Become a sustaining member of this program, and also join the people who are in discussion about the show on our Facebook group, which is simply &#8220;Intercepted Listeners.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I want to thank everyone who has offered their support over these past few weeks. We are blown away and humbled by the amount of support that we&#8217;ve gotten from more than 1,300 people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you are in a financial position where you can make a monthly donation or maybe a one-time donation. We&#8217;re also looking for people to offer challenge money, meaning that every dollar would be matched for the dollar that you contribute. If somebody, for instance, has $5000 that they want to contribute to support this program, we can do that as a matching fund, so that dollar for dollar, we would challenge other Intercepted Listeners to match your contribution and that would double the money that we have available during this fundraising drive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let us know that you&#8217;re there, let us know that you support this program, that you want it to keep going strong and join the more than 1,300 people who&#8217;ve already done so at theintercept.com/join. We have a really special show coming up for you. We did a live taping in Toronto, Canada, and let&#8217;s get on with it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Will DiNovi:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s give it up for Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Having an Average Weekend&#8221; by Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Edwin S.

And we have Desmond Cole in the House tonight.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As Trump would say, we have somebody I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of good things about lately, named Naomi Klein.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We have the hip-hop artist, formerly known as The Narcicyst, now just Narcy, who&#8217;s going to be performing for us and joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we get started, I want to just say a few words about the state of the United States and the world in this Trump moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As many of you know, we have this very colorful president — actually, just one color, he&#8217;s orange. But, he is a very dangerous individual on a number of levels: We have the threat that Trump keeps tweeting and stating of wiping the country of North Korea off the map. It&#8217;s a country of 25 million people. Trump just stripped the ability of millions of poor people in the United States to have health care. They are trying to take away access to abortion from women, because his vice president Mike Pence is a theo-conservative, he is a Christian jihadist, who is a Christian supremacist and actually he does call his wife, &#8220;Mother,&#8221; Mike Pence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And within this administration you have some very sophisticated neocons that believe in the redrawing of maps, combined then, with a predator toward women, who is a reality show host, who is one of the thinnest-skinned humans walking the planet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that combination — this is not just, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s so funny, look at the stupid thing that Trump said recently or tweeted recently.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot of that. And it would be easy to get sucked in the vortex of just laughing our way through the misery. But the stakes are so high for every country in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in our political context in the United States right now, the Democratic Party, and its most prominent members, are engaged in a rebranding of some of the most dangerous entities in the U.S. government: the CIA, the FBI, the military, the National Security Agency. The Democrats are doubling and tripling down on this idea that the deep state or these intelligence entities or the military is going to protect the Republic from Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time you have Trump who has no political experience, has no idea how the Congress works. In fact, I want to reporter some time to ask Trump to name any amendment to the U.S. Constitution except the Second Amendment, and describe what it says. Because I actually think, he probably would misstate the First Amendment, he would know it was something about speech, but I guarantee you, he doesn&#8217;t understand that it&#8217;s restricting the government from going after the freedom of speech of the citizens. Second Amendment, of course, is the one that makes us a country of gun nuts. None of the other amendments that have to do with, you know, search and seizure, or, — he may know about taking the Fifth, you know, because he may have to do that at some point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But you have this guy who truly does seem on some levels to be an imbecile, and does not engage in any sort of effective oversight from the executive branch of these entities: the CIA, the FBI, etc.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He&#8217;ll criticize the FBI because they&#8217;re investigating him. He didn&#8217;t like James Comey, because Comey, ultimately at the end, wouldn&#8217;t go along with the agenda, but let&#8217;s be clear here: The FBI ran the COINTELPRO Program in the United States that was targeted black activists, targeting the antiwar movement, trying to destroy grassroots movements. That FBI today is still engaged with racial profiling, tarring people with the brush of terrorism, maintaining watch lists, harassing people at their homes, conducting night raids, engaging in fictitious terror plots that then result in the arrest of vulnerable people — that still remains the FBI. Those are not the protectors of the Republic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, on the one side, you have the Democrats pouring praise into the bucket of the national security state in the United States, and, on the other hand, you have a president that has no idea how to oversee anything they&#8217;re doing, and talks all the time about how he loves the generals — he just loves his generals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is a golden era for the CIA, the U.S. military and the FBI, thanks not just to Donald Trump, but also to the Democratic Party in the United States. And we&#8217;re going to talk about some of this with our guests, and also see if there is any analog in Canada to some of what we&#8217;re seeing unfolding right now, with His Royal Orangeness.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The first guest that I want to bring on is a very dear friend of mine, her books &#8220;No Logo&#8221; and &#8220;The Shock Doctrine&#8221; both exploded like the moral equivalent of a bomb in taking on powerful corporations and powerful government institutions and going after vultures who pray on the most vulnerable people, nations, and communities. And her latest book is called &#8220;No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump&#8217;s Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need.&#8221; Please join me in welcoming Naomi Klein. [Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We had wanted Chelsea Manning to be here, but the Canadian government will not allow her to come in to Canada.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience boos]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to begin by welcoming Naomi Klein, who is speaking out in an effort to try to get Trudeau to change that policy so that Chelsea Manning can come here. But first, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Naomi Klein:\u003c/strong> Thank you, Jeremy. And welcome to my hometown. It&#8217;s so great to have you here. Yeah!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Just your thoughts on this. Trudeau is portrayed as, you know, sort of this liberal and the conventional wisdom would have been, &#8220;Oh, of course he would welcomed someone like Chelsea Manning into Canada.&#8221; I mean that was, I think was a large part of the perception in the United States. What&#8217;s behind Trudeau saying, &#8220;No,” Chelsea Manning, — who is a whistleblower that had been sentenced to 35 years in prison and had her, a large portion of her sentence commuted by President Obama — why would Trudeau do this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Well presumably because they don&#8217;t want to antagonize Trump. You know, I think it shows a moral cowardice on their part. Especially this week you know, you said Jeremy, how high the stakes are. They seem to get higher every week. But for us as Canadians watching Justin Trudeau just sit quietly by as Trump threatens to pull licenses from broadcasters. Meanwhile, he seems to think that flirting with Ivanka Trump is a foreign policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, meanwhile Canada has barred entry to Chelsea Manning, who wanted to be in this country, wanted to be speaking, having meetings, doing human rights work, speaking out for trans rights. She has served her time. She is not a threat to public safety. It would actually not be that courageous a move to let her come here. Obama determined that she deserved her freedom, and that freedom should include coming to Canada and speaking on stages like this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think it&#8217;s to our great shame that she was not invited here. But I think that, for Canadians, it&#8217;s not all that shocking, right, from what we have seen from this government, which is a lot of memes, right? A lot of marketing. You know Trudeau and Trump, they have very different brands, but frankly, they&#8217;re both all about the brands. They both really like photo-bombing weddings. They have stuff in common.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Just one other note on Chelsea Manning, it&#8217;s not just Canada that is not allowing her in. Harvard University had originally offered her a fellowship and then after Mike Morrell, who was the former acting director of the CIA, and is at a separate program at Harvard, Mike Morell writes this letter saying that he&#8217;s resigning and goes on a tirade against Chelsea Manning and Harvard: in an almost real-time instant takes away the fellowship from Chelsea Manning and yet gives one to Sean Spicer, the former propagandist for, and current — well, he&#8217;s still a propagandist for Trump but he used to be the official propagandist for Trump. Now he&#8217;s the unofficial propagandist for Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But this is part, and this what I want to ask —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s worth reminding people, Jeremy, how important Chelsea&#8217;s bravery was and continues to be. I mean she blew the whistle on the targeting of civilians, on the targeting of journalists. It was a very, very specific act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the dirty deeds that the U.S. State Department was conducting across the globe: hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and they&#8217;ve never been able to pin a single loss of life on anything that was leaked by Chelsea Manning. But the people who did the torturing, who were part of the torture programs, are getting posts at universities in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>General Stanley McChrystal the former head of JSOC, the Joint Special Operations Command, is at Yale University. John Brennan, former head of the CIA and an apologist for the torture program and career CIA, is at both the University of Texas and Fordham.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Admiral William McRaven, another JSOC commander, runs the University of Texas system. David Petraeus, the list goes on and on and on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, you expose torture, you get disinvited from the elite university —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> You commit it!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But you commit torture and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Welcome on board the faculty, the staff lounge is over there, General.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Yeah and Harvard apologizes for momentarily acting in good conscience, and with morality. And it&#8217;s extraordinary, right? My understanding is that the reason why Chelsea has not been allowed to travel to Canada is because they said that if she had committed these acts in Canada it would be treason. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, for me this is particularly painful because this was not treason, this was an act of tremendous courage, of whistleblowing, of war resistance. And I think it&#8217;s worth remembering that Trudeau&#8217;s father, who I don&#8217;t want to hold up as this absolute hero, but he did say that Canada should be a refuge from militarism, that Canada should be a refuge of militarism, he said that during the Vietnam War. And it was under that banner that thousands of Vietnam War Resisters were able to come to this country, including my parents. [Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> So, things are getting less courageous with time and I think it&#8217;s a reminder that we do have options. You know, I think a lot of Canadians are accepting this idea that all we can do is just roll over in the face of the kind of atrocities that we&#8217;re seeing from the Trump Administration, because we&#8217;re so weak. But it wasn&#8217;t always this way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and also in the world that we live in right now and the nature of technology and warfare, Canada cannot say that its hands are clean of the bloodletting that the U.S. is engaged in around the world. I saw the recent reports of Canadian military assistance and support going to Saudi Arabia, you know, Saudi Arabia is in the process of obliterating the nation of Yemen. It is one of the most anti-Democratic nations in the world, and it is being militarily supported by Trudeau&#8217;s government. By Canada. Canada participated in the U.S. kidnapping and torture of Maher Arar at JFK Airport, and never really has fully, no one&#8217;s been ever held fully accountable for the kidnapping and torture of Maher Arar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Canada is deeply involved with American wars across the globe, through these various partnerships with the NSA, with the U.S. military, and just because Canadian boots are not on the ground doesn&#8217;t mean that the blood of people across the world isn&#8217;t on the Canadian government&#8217;s hands, as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And the boots, the boots are often on the ground, as they were in Afghanistan, and, you know, even the example that I cited, which is an example I think that as Canadians we should be proud of, it&#8217;s not a complete story, because Canada was producing and exporting massive amounts of Agent Orange, even as we were claiming, &#8220;Well, you know, we&#8217;re not participating in this war.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, Canada&#8217;s record is, you know, Canada&#8217;s marketing pretty consistently doesn&#8217;t live up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to bring another guest into this conversation. I know that, to this crowd here, our next guest is a household name. For those of you following along at home, Desmond Cole is a journalist, he&#8217;s an activist, he may be the next mayor of Toronto? [Audience cheers and applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Desmond Cole, come up and join us here. [Audience cheers and applause] Desmond, of course, is the writer of a very popular column at The Toronto Star — Oh no. No. Wait! [Audience laughter.] He&#8217;s not a columnist at The Toronto Star. Desmond, first welcome to Intercepted, and why aren&#8217;t you, why aren&#8217;t you a columnist at The Toronto Star?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Desmond Cole:\u003c/strong> Yeah, welcome indeed! I left. I quit. And I quit because I staged a political protest at a police services board meeting, the police oversight for our city police force. I staged protest in April. After I did that I received a message from my boss saying he wanted to talk to me at The Toronto Star. I went in to talk to him and he said that the protest that I had staged was against The Toronto Star&#8217;s rules for all writers, including freelance columnists like myself. They did not say they were going to have any consequence for what I did. They did not even say what the consequence would be if I did it again. The piece of paper that was printed out for me, helpfully, by my boss at the time, Andrew Phillips, stated that you can be fired for these things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the message, Canadian style, was very clear. [Laughter from the audience]. This is how we say “shut up” in Canadian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I didn&#8217;t want to be told to shut up. I was very proud to write for a year and a half for the Star. I think I did some good work there. I know I definitely brought a big following to their newspaper. But I won&#8217;t be bullied for standing up for myself and other black people in this country. So, I left. [Audience applause].\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, Desmond, I&#8217;ve been following your work and you are the best kind of disruptor of the so-called good order that we have in humanity, the kinds of people who are not afraid to be the person in the room that everyone is saying, &#8220;Why is this person ruining our good time at the press conference?&#8221; [Audience laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s never a good time though, is the funny thing, right? You see them sitting sour faced at these police services board meetings, like they don&#8217;t even want to be there, and then they act angry when you bring a little spice to the thing, you know? [Audience laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, for people that don&#8217;t know the inside joke here between you and the audience about the Canadian media, there is a very serious issue that is at the core of why you&#8217;re doing this, and I think that this may come as news to a lot of people in the United States: That in Canada there are similar conditions faced by black and brown people in this country with law enforcement, with the police, with surveillance, with lack of accountability when people are assaulted, wrongly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the cases that actually resulted in, not an officer&#8217;s arrest but your arrest, happened this July, when you disrupted one of these meetings. And I want to give you an opportunity to explain to everyone the case that spurred you to disrupt this meeting and what happened when you were elected — arrested. Elected? We&#8217;re, we&#8217;re going to get to that in a minute. Trust me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you were arrested. So, lay that out, Desmond.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> When I got arrested, I get arrested a lot at police headquarters. So, oh, by the way for everybody listening in America, in Toronto, the police oversight meets inside the police headquarters, it&#8217;s really interesting. And then it&#8217;s really easy to arrest you there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Don&#8217;t give Trump any ideas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I know, right? I want to get to that theme later, though, that Americans could actually, and do, learn a lot about how to repress people from us. Because that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s how we flip the script, right? That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really going on a lot of the time. But when I got arrested in April, I was protesting a police practice called “carding.” We colloquially have given it that name in the communities because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Where&#8217;s your ID card?&#8221; So, it&#8217;s police officers in our country, in the province of Ontario here, and in Toronto, everywhere in the surrounding Toronto area, it&#8217;s the practice of police officers, stopping people, who, according to them are not suspected of any crime. There&#8217;s no probable cause here, there&#8217;s no, &#8220;we saw you doing this or that,&#8221; stopping these individuals and requesting that they give identification, “carding,” and then taking that information and storing it in police databases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This activity really started to ramp up after what&#8217;s colloquially called the &#8220;Summer of the Gun&#8221; in Toronto in 2005, where the strategy was: there&#8217;s a lot of shootings happening, there were a couple that were quite fatal, a lot of casualties. And the response from police in Toronto was: let&#8217;s flood these areas with police, let&#8217;s have the police presence off the charts and these are mainly areas where black and brown people in the city of Toronto live.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This turned into a practice of, well now that we&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s start mass collecting information and keeping it so that we know who it&#8217;s like all about the gangs, right? So, the gang members need to be tracked, so if we know who their sister is, if we know who their best friend is — heck, if we know who is around them in kind of this fear that we can create like, Wire-style, where we have the pictures posted up on the board then we can get to these folks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, you suck up all of that information and you get people who have absolutely nothing to do with the minuscule group of so-called gang members that you claim that you&#8217;re going after. In Toronto, you ask police: &#8220;How many gang members are there in Toronto?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, about two or three thousand.&#8221; &#8220;But how many people have been carded?&#8221; The police collected about 1.2 million of these contact cards in the span of, I believe, three years, when this practice was at its height. Like, are you going into baby strollers? Like, who are you asking for identification?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What data is included on those cards?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Everything collected under carding, including your name, obviously your physical stats: How much do you weigh? How tall are you? But then we get into the stuff like your associations, so they actually had a section on this form that said &#8220;young person information,&#8221; where they knowingly documented the information of minors, including whether or not their parents were married or divorced. And I believe that that particular field was, again, this idea of we can track your parents&#8217; last names, if your parents have different last names, we know everything about you. Right? They are doing this to children, but they&#8217;re primarily doing this to you young black men in the city of Toronto.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s lots of groups who are being over represented in this activity. People with disabilities, people with mental health issues, indigenous people in the city of Toronto, people who generally living in poor neighborhoods, racialized people of different backgrounds. But black men, black men, there are estimates and stats from The Toronto Star that in some neighborhoods, you would have actually collected more contact cards than there are black men in the neighborhood, between ages of about 18 and 35.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So we&#8217;re all in these databases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our current mayor promised, after supporting this effort for years, promised that he was going to fix things. He referenced my name the day that he said he had changed his mind. And I went and stood up in April, because that practice continues in an altered form, in an altered way and the police still have in their possession years, and years, of data on innocent people who they can then refer back to this information at any time for God knows what.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we know that people have lost job opportunities over these kinds of information being shared through background checks for employment and things like this. We know that people have been turned down opportunities at school because they want to work with a vulnerable sector, and, again, this information comes up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t say you did anything criminal, but just to be safe now that we have all this documentation about you, we say no.&#8221; I&#8217;ve written stories about people who lost their jobs this way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I protested in April because that was going on. It hasn&#8217;t stopped. Our media is asleep. Stalling tactics really, really work in this city and in this province and in this country, as they do everywhere, and when you say you&#8217;re going to do something and it doesn&#8217;t affect a great many people&#8217;s lives who have power and authority, they just believe you and let, let it go and then months later when you see me with my fist up in the police station, people are like, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s he on about?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s why I protested in April. I protested in July and got arrested for real. I only got escorted out by four armed police officers in April. I got arrested in July, because July was the first police services board meeting after one of the most appalling discoveries of police collusion over an incident of brutality that we&#8217;ve ever seen in this city.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A young man by the name of Dafonte Miller, 19 years-old, is going through the neighborhood of Whitby, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto,, with two friends on an evening in December. They walked by the residence of a senior Toronto police sergeant, I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s a sergeant, senior Toronto police official, let me put it that way, this official works in the Toronto police service, his house is in Whitby. And his job among others is to make sure that if somebody hurts a member of the public who is a police officer or is believed to have hurt a member of the public, his job as a Toronto police officer is he calls the provincial oversight and they start investigating.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, these three boys walking by that police officer&#8217;s house. His son, who is also a police officer, and his other son, are sitting in the garage. These two white men, seeing these three black kids walking by them start asking a whole bunch of questions about where they&#8217;re going. This man is a cop, but he&#8217;s off-duty. The kids, after a while, are like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to talk to you, we don&#8217;t know who you are, we&#8217;re going on our way.&#8221; These two men get out of the garage and chase these three kids, two of them get away, Dafonte Miller does not. These men are armed with a pipe, a metal pipe, and they beat Dafonte, breaking bones in his jaw, breaking bones in his upper body, damaging his left eye so badly that it has to now — is scheduled to be removed from his face.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Durham police force, where this occurs, arrive, and see this young man beaten so very badly and see two white men standing there saying, &#8220;He tried to attack us.&#8221; And they lay five charges on Dafonte Miller and let these two men go home. The Toronto police were alerted by the Durham police that night, and they let this man Michael Theriault, go back into the streets of Scarborough to police a neighborhood full of black people and gave him his gun and said, &#8220;Go.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it was only seven months later, after the Dafonte Miller&#8217;s lawyer contacted the oversight because, circling back to the dad whose house this all happened in front of, somehow the Toronto police didn&#8217;t call the SIU, the oversight, to say a police officer hurt someone and you need to investigate. Somehow the father of these two young men who were involved in this crime, who have now been charged, and the charges on Dafonte dropped — somehow he and his colleagues didn&#8217;t alert the oversight.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, of course, now there are allegations that the father was actively involved in covering up his son&#8217;s crime. Surprise, surprise.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I got arrested. Because it occurs to me that you can call me a journalist, you can call me an activist, these distractive conversations, like, so we don&#8217;t have to get to the issue. I don&#8217;t care what you call me. Someone has to stand up when, in July, after we learned that, the police services board in Toronto has a meeting, and that&#8217;s not on the agenda. And that&#8217;s why I went there, knowing that I would probably get arrested and I was, And I was told, &#8220;You&#8217;re trespassing on a public property. And if you come back to the public property, we will arrest you again.” And I said, &#8220;Here are my hands! Put the cuffs on me if you need to, and I will be back.&#8221; And I was back in August with 150 people and it was interesting how I walked in the door.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to do, whatever we call ourselves, if we&#8217;re not willing to stand up to an oversight, a so-called police oversight, that can see these things happening, and not act, not raise the alarm, say “we&#8217;re looking into it,” and then again, nothing for months now, we haven&#8217;t heard about Dafonte Miller from this board.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I do disrupt when I see that questions like these are not being answered. I&#8217;m putting myself at risk, I guess, but I could be walking down the street and have this happen anyway. And it&#8217;s been me many times. It&#8217;s been many of people in our community many times.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve gotten to a place in my career, even though I am no longer a Toronto Star columnist, where I can use the influence that I have to dare them to treat me the way they&#8217;re not afraid of treating so many of us. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to end well for me, I honestly don&#8217;t. Like, I can&#8217;t win this fight the way I&#8217;m doing it but, when somebody comes up with a better idea I&#8217;m listening. [Audience applause and cheering]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re going to be joined by the musical artist that is now going to make his words known in a different kind of a way. His name is Narcy.[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Narcy — “We Are on The Verge.”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Yassin “Narcy” Alsalman:\u003c/strong> How&#8217;s everybody feeling tonight? Make some noise for The Intercept, everybody, make some noise. Naomi Klein, Desmond Cole, Jeremy Scahill. My name is Yassin, I&#8217;m a Montrealer, it&#8217;s good to be in Toronto tonight. And I believe in a better world. You know? I recently had children and, I have no choice but to believe in a better world, as hard as it may be. A world war-free.

A bullet or noose? Why do we live and pollute, then clean and remove?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Forgive me, I lose track, most of my people are under attack. Trying to breathe, smothered in gas, working a shift, pumping your gas, driving a cab, paying a tax, laying their countries flat, open a Laundromat, what’s wrong with that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Everything’s relative, self in development. Right? And he’s steady been digging the plan, give him an inch, and he’s taking the land. Everyone scared to be sticking the Man. Must be that taste of Freedom, what do you think it takes to beat him? He’s the cheater, there’s no trust in that. I don’t even think this country loves me back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I believe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Free.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For our children&#8217;s children.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One day, we are free.

[Audience applause and cheering]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alright, that is Narcy, also known as Yassin Alsalman. In addition to being a hip hop artist, Narcy is also spearheading a multimedia effort that&#8217;s a collective called The Medium. He also, in his spare time, he&#8217;s a professor at Concordia University, and he&#8217;s a Juno-nominated music video director. And he, there&#8217;s an amazing video, it&#8217;s one of my favorite semi-current videos that Narcy directed that features, A Tribe Called Red, and Yasiin Bey/Mos Def. And it&#8217;s some of the most brilliant storytelling through music and visuals that I&#8217;ve seen of late and so, you know, big gratitude to you for the work that you&#8217;ve done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> Thank you, thank you man. Big gratitude to you, man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, I want to ask you about the different worlds that you kind of straddle: The academic world, the hip-hop world, but also navigating life in a post-9/11 world, and in an environment where Muslims, Arabs, like Desmond was talking about, the situation of black people in Canada right now, with the carding.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You also live an existence where you, too, are a target regardless of which side of the border you&#8217;re on, between Canada and the United States. Can you talk about the navigation of those worlds and the struggles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> I just shave my beard wherever I go, so I don&#8217;t get in trouble. But I mean, I think that it&#8217;s necessary to hit on all angles, which is one of the main reasons why we put the collective together. Everybody in the collective comes together like Voltron. We all do something different, so together, it&#8217;s the whole gamut of creation, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, as an artist, I started in 2001, with a group called Euphrates, we&#8217;re three Iraqis that came to Canada around the same time. And I was studying political science and then 9/11 happened and I got really disillusioned with the department so I started doing communication studies, and we all went into that department and started recording late night. And when the music really picked up, obviously, you know, being Iraqi and the war, they started covering us a lot more in Canadian media. But it was really like, &#8220;These are the safe — look at these Iraqis, they can make music.&#8221; You know? It wasn&#8217;t like it was in a dissection of the music. It was the story, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So then when I started going to the States, obviously I&#8217;ve been detained at borders, I&#8217;ve done a video about it, it&#8217;s a very regular occurrence in our community, but what blows my mind is that wherever I land and once I get out of that border office, an Arab guy or an African guy picks me up and takes me to the next location. You walk out the cinema, they&#8217;re selling falafels. Like, we&#8217;re everywhere. You know? You can&#8217;t really catch us anymore. [Audience laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> So, I just navigate it, man. I mean it&#8217;s really become a part of what I do and just let it inform the work and the way you give it back to people is to code it with a bit of humor or sarcasm for people to go — “Oh! Oh. That&#8217;s just kind of —” you know, like to feel weird about how they feel, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We premiered a Narcy track on our podcast earlier this year, about —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s what got him fired, by the way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s why Steve Bannon is no longer in the White House. And you can you can check that out, too, on the podcast website. That was a big hit with our audience, too, and, well, let&#8217;s just say for purposes of this discussion, you&#8217;re the one that forced Steve Bannon out of the White House. Let&#8217;s see who comes after him, though, and if they are any better or worse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Right now, you have Donald Trump saying that, you know, he&#8217;s in the process of destroying ISIS. Your native country of Iraq is being — parts of it are being obliterated, in the U.S.-led war that&#8217;s supposedly against ISIS. You also have sectarian groups that have been empowered by the post-U.S. invasion realities in Iraq that are also acting like murderous thugs, and, sort of, gangsters and some of them built up by the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We have massive outpouring of refugees, people fleeing their home countries and trying to make their way to Europe or other places where they feel that they can have safety. When you watch what&#8217;s happened to Iraq from the Saddam era, where the U.S. was selling him weapons, when he was at his most brutal, to the sanctions imposed by Clinton, you know, that was economic warfare against the people of Iraq, to then the invasion, and occupation, and then the encouraging of sectarian division, and now this war with no heroes, no good guys, that the U.S. is continuing to pour fire on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It seems like no end in sight, but what is it like for you as you watch this, what are you paying attention to? What are the feelings that it stirs up in you? I&#8217;m sure a lot of diaspora people are feeling like: Hopeless.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> Well, you know, back when I believed in the Illuminati, you know, I used to do a lot of research. When the Internet was slower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> And I discovered this thing called the PNAC, The Project for a New American Century. And back then, you know, you look at the map and the way they drew out the Arab world and all these plans that they had for the Arab world, which felt very farfetched at the time. Right? but then as you as you watch the last decade and a half pass by, it became a reality. Right? They just did it really slowly and like, you know took their time with it, changed faces, put on different gloves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, at first it felt like a whirlwind of emotions. Right, it&#8217;s anger, sadness, you want justice. And then as I got older, I realized, you know, this might just be some sort of a universal karmic moment. Like, our region had its time during the Mesopotamian era, and they weren&#8217;t great either, but maybe we&#8217;re just watching this change happening in the region slowly. But now, as I watch it now, you know, everything is gone. What do we have left, besides the Gulf? And why is the Gulf still there? You know, you&#8217;ve got to ask yourself these questions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s a lot to process so I try to just know that, you know, there&#8217;s a bigger plan and it&#8217;s like a 20, 30-year plan, and we&#8217;re watching it unfold slowly, and to not jump on every boat that passes by and just really inform myself from people on the ground, journalists, creatives on the grounds, filmmakers on the ground. Like, what is really happening back home? How can we get involved? And really just hand to hand with kids and help kids that need surgery, and, you know, that&#8217;s really all we can do at this point. It&#8217;s just been a 30-year war, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Naomi, you wrote and excellent article as you first started covering Iraq called &#8220;Baghdad Year Zero,&#8221; and you were talking about, just to echo some of what Yassin is saying, these economic neoliberal policies merging together, with war profiteering, with that neo-conservative agenda, with the ideas that were laying around from the University of Chicago school of thought about these issues. As you look back now on when you first embarked on covering Iraq and looking at what the consequences of the U.S. invasion were going to amount to, what&#8217;s your current analysis of what&#8217;s happening there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I think having that history is so important, especially because, and this is something you&#8217;ve talked about recently on the show, is the way in which some of the architects of the Project for a New American Century have now reinvented themselves as Never Trump-ers and have been embraced by liberal elites in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Including the proud Canadian David Frum, who gave us the “Axis of Evil” speech.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Who gave us the “Axis of Evil” speech. And we are in their architecture, right? I mean, you know, whether it&#8217;s North Korea, you know, or Iraq and I think we need to remember that because there is this incredible ahistorical narrative that everything around Trump reinforces this idea of exceptionalism. Right? Which is in some way why he is the perfect American president, right? You know, because this is a country that stands for exceptionalism and impunity through wealth and power and isn&#8217;t that Donald Trump&#8217;s brand?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there is this way in which is, they are a perfect fit. Right? I have impunity on my mind right now. And I feel like it&#8217;s the crime that unites all crimes, whether it&#8217;s sexual abuse of women and harassment, whether it is theft of indigenous lands, whether it is the mercenary armies that you write about, Jeremy. I mean, it is all about these, mostly men, who believe that because of their sheer brute force and wealth, and maybe their celebrity, they get to grab whoever, wherever, whatever they want. You know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Donald Trump, you know, he talks about grabbing women&#8217;s pussies, he also talks about how we should have grabbed Iraq&#8217;s oil. And I guess for me, when I look at this and when I look at my earlier work on Iraq, one of the things that I think we didn&#8217;t concentrate enough on was the climate implications of all of this, right? We knew it was a war that had a lot to do with oil. We knew Iraq wouldn&#8217;t have been invaded if their, you know, major export was asparagus — who said that, was it Greenspan? I mean they always admit it after the fact, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I think what&#8217;s happening now in the region is that we see so clearly, or we should see so clearly, right, we live in this era of overlapping and intersecting crises. We can&#8217;t pry them apart, right? And the major driver of militarism around the world has been the quest for fossil fuels in the modern era, and that is the major driver of climate change. And now we have this cruel irony that the area has been looted for its fossil fuels also happens to be one of the driest areas on Earth, right? So now we have the added layer of the climate change kicking in that is the impact of stealing all that oil. And so that becomes a driver or an accelerant, right? It&#8217;s not the reason for civil war in Syria, but it certainly was an accelerant — having a million and a half people on the move in the midst of a historic drought.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Desmond, you mentioned before the break that the United States also has learned lessons from Canada in some of the ways that it operates at home and around the world. What did you mean by that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> I mean I really agreed with Naomi&#8217;s earlier comments about the branding and about how we are all about creating this image of ourselves, it&#8217;s almost, it is a meme, it&#8217;s a stereotype, it&#8217;s joke, but then there are so many like, really sinister things that are going on underneath.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I guess when I think about that, I just think of like the way that Canada and the United States over the years have traded strategies for repressing black people, strategies for oppressing indigenous people, that this isn&#8217;t just like a — and not just America, so like, where did South Africa get its ideas around Apartheid. By looking at the way that we had segregated, and created residential schools for, and dispossessed indigenous peoples here of their land, and saying “we can use these kinds of ideas.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Canada it is not this puppy dog that everybody wants to pretend that it is. It&#8217;s not this — it&#8217;s weird to have kind of one of your symbols of your country be like, this big burly white guy who was a police officer, but like we&#8217;ve managed to turn even that into this like, charming, cute, you know, the Mounties are this symbol of something of a joke, when they cleared this land of indigenous peoples who were here before them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I just think that there&#8217;s an exchange maybe it&#8217;s clear to say that there is an exchange of all of these ideas, and colonialism and white supremacy, going on between Canada, the United States, Britain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Israel. Australia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know when we talk about our immigration stuff that&#8217;s going on right now, right, like we are watching things like, “OK, Muslim ban in the United States, right?” And, as Naomi said, we&#8217;re kind of just looking, and being like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s not happening here! If you&#8217;re Muslim and you&#8217;re from Canada, we will exempt you from this horrible person&#8217;s policies. We won&#8217;t challenge him on the policy. No. That&#8217;s not our job. Our job is to — I don&#8217;t know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But certainly, the world is going to end if we challenge Donald Trump. That&#8217;s the idea. That&#8217;s the underlying idea, no matter who&#8217;s in power here, is that we don&#8217;t really have any agency to intervene and yet in those moments where we decide to take a completely different track from the United States, like, Canada doesn&#8217;t get blown up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And ICE officials come over to Canada and train our immigration officials about how to intimidate and terrify people in this country — there is an exchange going on here. It&#8217;s not about, now with the Trump business, everything is, &#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s going to come across the border to Canada and infect us like the plague,&#8221; as if we haven&#8217;t been doing this for two centuries plus on this land already, to black people, to indigenous people, to other racialized groups of people, Japanese internment in Canada, Chinese head tax in Canada, Sikhs not allowed to come in and be immigrants in Canada and turn back from the Komagata Maru.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We&#8217;ve been doing this. We know how to do this. And the idea that the Americans need to teach us is ridiculous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> I know that, you know, you guys in the U.S. have your hands full with your own problems right now, but I think that it&#8217;s important to understand that one of the ways in which Trump is a menace is the way in which he lowers the bar internationally, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He&#8217;s so awful, that anybody looks good by comparison.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, anything short of him like actually throwing his own feces at a crowd is like, &#8220;He looks mighty presidential!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> Exactly. So, I mean you&#8217;re experiencing that in the U.S., but we experience that outside the U.S., as well, right, where our leaders get away with murder just because they&#8217;re never going to be as bad as Trump, but that&#8217;s just not good enough. Right? I mean you see this with Macron — [Audience cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know I&#8217;ve been trying to challenge folks where Michelle Obama had that great line at the at the DNC, where she said: &#8220;When they go low, we go high.&#8221; Right? She was talking about tone and I don&#8217;t care at all about tone, I could care less, as you can tell. But I do think that we should be applying that not to tone, but to deeds that, as the U.S. goes rogue, as Washington goes rogue, everywhere these guys don&#8217;t control we need to use our maximum power and demand so much more of ourselves and of our governments. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And whether that&#8217;s climate change, refugee rights, you know, anti-racism indigenous rights, and also, within the U.S., right? In cities and states that Trump does not control. And there are plenty of them. We have to do more, right? And so, this is what the way in which I think we need to be really holding the Trudeau government to account. Sorry, sending out a meme that says refugees welcome is not good enough when they&#8217;re not. You know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> But exactly, so that got sent out and in the wake of all of this panic, I&#8217;d say about immigration changes in the United States, Trudeau capitalizes by sending out a message saying, &#8220;If you want to come here, you&#8217;re welcome!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, one of the big groups that have been coming here by the hundreds, are Haitians who are afraid of provisions of the their being able to stay in the United States, which are about to expire. And so, Haitians, among others in the world, hear our prime minister&#8217;s message: You can come here, you can be safe. And they&#8217;ve been coming by the hundreds across the border, in a place near Lacolle, Québec. They&#8217;ve been coming for several weeks now. Not only Haitian immigrants, but many of them Haitians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Little do they know, however, that a moratorium under, that&#8217;s right, the Harper government that stopped deportations back to Haiti has been lifted by the current government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So Haitians, ironically, are running here thinking that it might be safe because of messages from our Prime Minister and you see in the media this idea, that, &#8220;Oh, well, they must be spreading false information amongst their communities.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No, you&#8217;re prime minister. This is his brand. This is how he sells it, even if he doesn&#8217;t mean it. Because, what&#8217;s going to happen is, Haitians will have a chance to be deported from Canada, instead of having a chance to be deported from the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s basically what&#8217;s going on right now. So like, this branding exercise is so dangerous, and that&#8217;s why I resent this light, fluffy harmless Canada thing that we keep wanting to try to do, because it&#8217;s so dangerous. [Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, I was reading this poll that indicated that you would do pretty well in a mayoral race. [Audience applause and cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m not going to be that guy who&#8217;s going to waste people&#8217;s time by trying to have a back and forth about: &#8220;Are you going to run?&#8221; If you decided to run for mayor, what would you run on, what would your platform be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK: \u003c/strong>Totally hypothetically.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hypothetically.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Between me and you and the hundreds of people in this room and the probably hundreds of thousands of your listeners. But only us!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Just us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Because, I&#8217;m just working on this stuff, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to give you some kind of platform, because I honestly don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t — I don&#8217;t, what I want to say is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why would you do it and what would you be about if you were doing it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> I would do it because I would like to, and people have asked, &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you run for council instead of running for mayor?&#8221; which I&#8217;m not that interested in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If I was to do it, it would be to try and challenge the limits of courageous reform in municipal government and just to see what happened. I can&#8217;t believe how satisfied we are with these one-candidate elections where you always have to vote for candidate A, and you can never vote for candidate B, because Candidate C is sitting right here waiting for the two of you to duke it out and sneak up the middle. And the candidate who always gets asked to sit out: Olivia Chow, My friend Karen Sun, when she ran for office four years before, a woman of color, a Chinese woman, wait two years for Jagmeet Singh, who maybe your listeners have never heard of yet, but he&#8217;s the new leader of our new Democratic Party, which is the third party in government here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think a lot of people saw the video where he had a racist woman that was, that was verbal assaulting him. But then it went all over the place because he said, “ love is the way, we love you.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> I actually might get back into that, too, but like. Because that was, that was a thing, that was a thing, that was a thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JC:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m just reminding people that, that was that video.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m saying that in two years that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen to Jagmeet Singh is that people are going to say, &#8220;Well you can&#8217;t vote for Jagmeet Singh, because then the conservatives will win.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So we always have these situations, where Mayor Tory got in that way, where Justin Trudeau benefited from that dynamic, where the so-called centrist candidate is always the only person you can vote for to prevent the worst from happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Where I want to present a real agenda, completely away from all that kind of politics, I want to present an agenda that puts people who are being left behind right now in — everywhere — I want to put them first and I want to see what it would look like.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So I&#8217;m talking about things like our current mayor can find millions of extra dollars to patch a highway, the Gardiner Expressway, that is crumbling and that is just soaking up more and more of our money every year in repairs. I want to find that same amount of money and say, &#8220;So we have an upgrade happening to all of our transit right now for accessibility.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s going very slowly. And I&#8217;m wondering if you can pour millions of dollars into a highway that is ultimately going to fall to the ground, I would take that same money and I&#8217;d speed up the accessibility stuff so that more people can ride the public transit. Right? Like these are the kind of priorities that I want to push and I believe we can do it. But I want to go back into the Jagmeet thing, because it ties into another reason why I&#8217;d like to run.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Can I just insert one thing and we only have a few minutes left, and I&#8217;m going to let you do that, but I wanted to just point out that in the U.S. right now you do have in a number of municipalities radical or progressives winning mayoral races in pockets across United States, and it actually is one of the ways that slowly some of the American political landscape is being transformed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it&#8217;s, I mean, you would be in the company of people in this hemisphere that are fighting for big picture change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NK:\u003c/strong> And internationally. The mayor of Barcelona, a former housing rights activists who was squatting buildings a few years ago, Ada Colau, and now Barcelona is becoming this laboratory for how much you can do municipally. So, it&#8217;s exciting. [Audience applause and cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it is. And that relates to my other point, because if the way that Americans know Jagmeet Singh, is that fact that he was at a campaign rally, this is a man who is of the, it&#8217;s often pronounced &#8220;seek&#8221; but I keep being corrected that it is “sick,” he is of the Sikh religion, an Indian minority, and he wears a turban, and so that&#8217;s a very visible sign of his faith, and a woman came up to him at a campaign event and began screaming at him about Sharia law — wrong religion. They never care, you know. But what was so sad was that everybody was like, &#8220;Wow look how patiently this man whose literal life was at risk by a person who nobody knew and was right in his face, look how calmly and patiently he dealt with her. Look how much he talked about love and about we need to be together on this.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;m not criticizing Jagmeet Singh, he had very few options in that scenario that could have gone anywhere near well for him. And if she just decides to outright physically attack him, we&#8217;re not talking about how he was loving. OK? Because he wasn&#8217;t safe. But those folks who were in that room who were running with a man who is now the first nonwhite leader of a political party in Canada, they needed to know what to do in that situation to protect him and they didn&#8217;t know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s going to happen to me when I run — if I run. [Audience applause and cheering]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We got it!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Just as it happened to Olivia Chow three years ago, people standing up at debates and telling her to go back to China. And I want to run in part to build on all of the grassroots stuff that&#8217;s happening here in Toronto now. That is talking about how we fight back against these repressive forces, so that it&#8217;s not actually about me standing up and putting on a cape. It&#8217;s actually about having a community, having a set of communities, who we’re all in consultation, we’re all in lockstep, we’re all going out and supporting each other&#8217;s messages, supporting all these interwoven causes from climate to transit to racial inequality. We&#8217;re all walking in lockstep, we&#8217;re talking, we&#8217;re chatting, we&#8217;re checking in with each other, we&#8217;re protecting each other when somebody comes for one of us. I want to run so that we can start to weave all of those things together in a way that will build something lasting for our city. If I run.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience laughter, applause, and cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think it would be incredibly exciting if you did run and I think it would be transformative. And so I hope you do. [Audience applause, and cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Ten seconds, can I level with y&#8217;all, just ten seconds. I just want to be honest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What were you just being?!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience laughter]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s real politician talk. &#8220;Let me just be honest here.&#8221; Go ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m scared. I honestly fear the amount of naked racism and anger that is allowed to present itself in public in what we call the most multicultural city in the world. I&#8217;m scared for asking other people to come and work for me without us having strategies about how we&#8217;re going to deal with the emotional, the psychological, the spiritual warfare, I take that really seriously. So that does give me pause.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is not a sales pitch. I didn&#8217;t put my name out there on this poll. They did it. And I have been thinking about this for a long time, but I do it with pause because it&#8217;s a lot of collective responsibility that we all have to look after one another. Because if we run a campaign and half of us come out of it with half of ourselves missing, it wasn&#8217;t worth it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, I appreciate your candor on that, and given all of the work that you&#8217;re doing, you do know the risk. And I&#8217;ve really admired the way that you have put yourself between the police force and their conduct and try to say, &#8220;This is going to stop or you will be held accountable.&#8221; Because there are many people in many societies around the world that do that and I give you a lot of credit for being that person here in Toronto.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We really have to wrap up I want to give Yassin and Naomi a quick moment for closing thoughts, I won&#8217;t ask Naomi if she&#8217;s going to run against you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DC:\u003c/strong> Don&#8217;t split the vote.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;ll start with Yassin, just brief closing comment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> I think just listening to everything we&#8217;ve been talking about, you know, what we&#8217;re all realizing is that we view nations as separate histories and nations they get deleted as though their history is being deleted, and not ours. But really, whether you take the example of Iraq or any other country, it&#8217;s world history that has been deleted and our children will inevitably suffer from that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think what&#8217;s happening now in the world and the way power&#8217;s being exercised and called out and — they&#8217;re just afraid because the so-called minority is now the majority and they can&#8217;t win. We&#8217;re bigger than everybody. [Audience applause and cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>YA:\u003c/strong> So, come try to get us. We&#8217;re just going to form together, and it&#8217;s gonna, you can&#8217;t control it anymore.

But the flip side of it is exactly what we&#8217;re hearing: There is a new spirit out there, a rising spirit out there, that is committed to truth telling and is committed to fighting for what we actually want, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you see this, I think it is global, I think it is powered by a generation of young people that didn&#8217;t grow up as ideologically indoctrinated. They came of age post-2008 financial crisis where all the neo liberal ideologues have been running for the hills. And they&#8217;re like, they wan to fight for all of it, you know? And that is a really powerful moment and I think we can sometimes forget that as scary as what is happening on the right side of the political spectrum is, there are some really exciting things happening on the other side of the political spectrum, too, and we have to give ourselves some credit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause and cheers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to thank my wonderful, excellent, super, super smart guests for joining me here.

Jeremy explains how the media and Capitol Hill reaction is either a symbol of complete incompetence or a crass act of political theater. This week on Intercepted: Investigative journalist Jane Mayer exposes the Koch-brother puppet masters behind Vice President Mike Pence’s rise to power and lays out how the merging of radical extremist Christian ideology and the ruthless pursuit of corporate profits put Pence a heartbeat from the presidency. Chinese dissident and renowned artist Ai Weiwei has released a massive public art installation across New York City as his new film, “Human Flow,” hits theaters. We speak to Ai about the humanitarian catastrophe of the 65 million globally displaced migrants and refugees who have fled terror groups, U.S. and Russian bombs, and climate change. He also shares his thoughts on Trump and talks about his own persecution in China.

We have just been astonished at the level of support that has poured in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We have almost 1,600 to date that have pledged their support to this program, to keep it on the air, to expand what we do on Intercepted, and to keep us going strong with our critical mission to hold the powerful accountable, to expose injustice and to provide people with information that they can use to make informed decisions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I want to let the people who have pledged their support know that your financial support of this program means that we will be able to keep this program totally free for anyone to listen to. We do not want to use a paywall. I really am committed to making this show available to anyone, anywhere in the world that wants to hear it. We don&#8217;t want to carve off some of our content to say, &#8220;Well, only this is going to be for our exclusive supporters. We want to be able to make the information that you hear on this program, every episode, to be available to everyone and by pledging your support to Intercepted, you are making that possible for people that may not be in a position to financially support this program but depend on the information, depend on the diversity of viewpoints and the guests and the books that you hear about on this program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you want to join the 1,600 people who have already become sustaining members of Intercepted, you can do that by going to theintercept.com/join. Become a sustaining member of Intercepted. We have some great thank-you gifts including a hoodie, digital downloads of our cold opens that you hear at the beginning of our program, there are stickers for your laptop with the Intercepted logo on them. But most importantly, you become a sustaining member of this program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you&#8217;re not in a position to contribute financially, it is still extremely valuable to tell your friends — hey, even tell your foes, about this program. Use it to challenge your friends: holidays are coming up, you can use some of the topics and information that you&#8217;ve heard on this program to argue with people, to take on issues that may be uncomfortable to discuss at the dinner table, but need to be discussed in the kind of time that we live in. Maybe this show will help you to change the minds of some of the people that play a very meaningful role in your life, but the Trump moment has caused big problems for you. Whatever your motivation is, we appreciate you supporting this program and we promise to you to keep our pledge and that is to bring you information that you can use to make informed decisions information that holds the powerful accountable and that gives voice to the voiceless.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our aim for this fundraising drive is to get ourselves to more than 2,000 sustaining members. We&#8217;re about four hundred members away from it. If you want to join the ranks of the 1,600 people that have already become sustaining members of Intercepted, we urge you to go to theintercept.com/join.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you can&#8217;t afford to make a donation, tell people about the show, review us on all of the platforms where you listen to your podcasts and also join our Facebook group, which is simply Intercepted Listeners. And you can discuss issues, and news, and ideas with other people that also listen to this show. I sometimes pop into those discussions, as do other staff members here at Intercepted. You can join with other people that are like-minded or are there also because they want to have discussion or they want to have debate. Also, you can share our work on social media platforms — the biggest thing is letting people know.

Joseph Dunford\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>:\u003c/strong> We owe the families as much information as we can find out about what happened, and we owe the American people an explanation of what their men and women were doing at this particular time. And, when I say that, I mean the men and women in harm&#8217;s way anywhere in the world, that they should know what the mission is and what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish when we&#8217;re there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Over the past week, there&#8217;s been an intense focus on what exactly happened to four U.S. soldiers in the African nation of Niger on October 4th. What we have been told is very little and what we&#8217;ve been told is based on information provided by the military and by the Trump Administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And what that picture looks like, as of now, is that a small group of Special Operations forces were on a sensitive mission in Niger. That they were traveling in so-called soft vehicles, meaning non-armored vehicles and that they were ambushed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And during this ambush, three U.S. soldiers were killed, two others were seriously wounded and another soldier, Sergeant La David Johnson, went missing and his body was not recovered until a couple of days later.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, what the exact nature of that mission was, or why they were in an armored vehicle, we do not know yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>:\u003c/strong> And the loss of our troops is under investigation. We, in the Department of Defense, like to know what we&#8217;re talking about before we talk. And so, we do not have all the accurate information yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In classic Donald Trump form, he has made the story about something other than “what were they doing there?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> I was —Look I&#8217;ve called many people, and I would think that every one of them appreciated it. I was very surprised to see this, to be honest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He has attacked the widow of Sergeant Johnson after she publicly said that she was shocked when Trump appeared to not know her husband&#8217;s name when he called her to offer his condolences. The president, she said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Myeshia Johnson:\u003c/strong> He knew what he signed up for. But it hurts anyways. And I was — it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn&#8217;t remember my husband name. The only way he remembered my husband name because he told me he had my husband&#8217;s report in front of him. And that&#8217;s when he actually said, La David.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which, on the surface, sounds like a very callous thing to say to a widow. Trump, for his part says that he meant nothing but respect, and that it was a dignified conversation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump and his allies have cast aspersions on Johnson&#8217;s widow as well as on her Congresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida. Some of the attacks on the congresswoman have been vile, with one of Trump&#8217;s sons saying on Twitter that she looks like a stripper. Real classy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But aside from the horrible attacks on a Gold Star widow or these grotesque attacks on the appearance of Congresswoman Frederica Wilson that have been emanating from the administration or from the president&#8217;s family or from his prominent supporters, this episode, meaning what happened in Niger and then the way that it has been covered in the media and discussed by politicians, it&#8217;s actually a classic example of how covert U.S. operations are dealt with in general in the United States, both in the media and on Capitol Hill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You have senators and congressmen rushing to microphones to question what were we doing in Niger? Why with the troops there? If you&#8217;re a Democrat, it&#8217;s: What was Donald Trump doing sending U.S. troops into Niger? And these congressmen feign ignorance as to the extent of the U.S. military footprint across the globe, particularly those Congress members that are on military committees or intelligence committees or oversight committees. They know exactly how extended U.S. military operations are across this world. So, this level of feigned ignorance: it&#8217;s either a symbol of total incompetence as lawmakers, or it&#8217;s a despicable act of partisan or political theater.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Since 9/11, the United States has embraced the concept that Donald Rumsfeld famously sketched out in one of his snowflake memos that the world is a battlefield, and that the U.S. has the right to send its commandos wherever, whenever, to kill whomever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald Rumsfeld:\u003c/strong> We are in a sense, seeing the definition of a new battlefield in the world. The 20th, 21st century battlefield.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> and the US has been doing this since George W. Bush, but through Barack Obama and through Donald Trump, with essentially no meaningful oversight or investigation from the U.S. Congress except when something goes wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Listen to this: in 2009, the U.S. Special Operations Command had its forces deployed in sixty countries around the world. By the time Donald Trump was elected president, that number had swelled to 138 countries. That was under Barack Obama. And the number continues to rise under Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>U.S. commandos were doing covert operations in Niger under Barack Obama and they were there under Donald Trump. In some countries, these commandos are categorized as trainers or advisers — that&#8217;s what the U.S. called its troops that were deployed in the early stages of the Vietnam War, too, so take that phrase with a grain of salt. But these forces also conduct raids, drone strikes, assassinations, kidnappings — all manner of covert operations. And the only time we ever really hear about it is when U.S. personnel die, when journalists or human rights groups document civilian deaths, or as in the case of the raid on Osama bin Laden&#8217;s compound, the U.S. wants to declare victory and celebrate the awesomeness of its commandos or its covert actions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some Democrats right now want to portray this situation in Niger as Trump&#8217;s Benghazi. But I think that&#8217;s a very bad comparison. In fact, Benghazi should not even be viewed as Obama or Hillary&#8217;s Benghazi. The real scandal here is that the U.S. does these operations all the time, all over the world, and we never pay any attention to it until something goes wrong, or, unless it&#8217;s valuable for propaganda purposes. The family of the four soldiers killed in Niger have a right to know why their loved ones died.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sergeant La David Johnson&#8217;s widow has a right to know where her husband&#8217;s body was for two days and why it wasn&#8217;t recovered until then. In fact, all of us have a right to know the answer to that. But we also have a right to know why on earth the U.S. has commandos in a majority of the world&#8217;s countries. By just chasing each incident, where the CIA or the Joint Special Operations Command conducts an operation that we hear about instead of actually investigating the entire program, nothing&#8217;s ever going to change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s the same bad apple theory from Abu Ghraib. &#8220;Oh, it was an anomaly. Just a few soldiers did it. We&#8217;ll prosecute the lowest ranking people and move on.&#8221; It&#8217;s the same thing. It&#8217;s like a cat chasing a ball of yarn in the room: you&#8217;re just focused on this one thing, but you&#8217;re losing sight of the big picture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s a direct arc that stretches from George W. Bush through Barack Obama to Donald Trump of covert actions done in secrecy with little-to-no oversight by the U.S. Congress or the courts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This entire system — the night raids, the drone strikes, the secret prisons, the snatching of people — all of it needs to be investigated and explained to the people. Niger won&#8217;t be the last of these. Not by a long shot. And part of the reason why is that the public is being taught to view these incidents as one-off disasters: Niger for Trump, Benghazi for Obama, and on, and on. This is now the American way of waging wars. There are U.S. troops positioned in 138-plus countries right now. What are they doing there? Who&#8217;s going to explain that? No one ever wants to touch that because then you need to ask questions about the fallacy of American exceptionalism and our nation&#8217;s addiction to militarism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the outrage is often episodic and it&#8217;s used, particularly by politicians, to make short-term political points. Until Congress actually does its job and conducts an open, meaning public, and wide-ranging inquiry into what the hell the U.S. special operations forces are doing in 138 countries, or what the CIA is doing across the globe, then they&#8217;re not doing their jobs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that&#8217;s been the reality for a long, long time, under both Democrats and Republicans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re going to kick off today&#8217;s show by taking a deep dive into the world of Vice President Mike Pence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The great investigative journalist Jane Mayer has a fascinating exposé on Pence in the recent issue of The New Yorker magazine. The title of it is, &#8220;The Danger of President Mike Pence.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jane is one of the best journalists of our time and she was one of the first reporters to crack open the CIA torture and extraordinary rendition program under Bush and Cheney. She has written a number of books. Her latest work has focused on investigating the Koch brothers and other shady right-wing or Republican financiers. Her most recent book is called “Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.” Jane Mayer joins me now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jane, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jane Mayer:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What I really found extraordinary about your piece is this notion of Mike Pence, not really as a principled conservative Christian, but as a real opportunist willing to set aside what he claimed were his bedrock principles in favor of whatever his kind of corporate paymasters or political expediency dictates he should do. Is that your sense?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> Yeah. And that was a surprise to me too. I mean, I think everybody had thought of him as kind of defining social conservatism and evangelical Christianity, and, in fact, what the reporting showed was that he&#8217;s very ambitious and he&#8217;s made his deals when he needs to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, in fact, his whole career really has been nurtured, supported, and sponsored by huge right-wing corporate interests. And I hadn&#8217;t realized that myself until I dug into it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There was a sense that Mike Pence was kind of this like shitty-magic-penny to buy the Christian right, sort of like calm with the idea of Trump being president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> He definitely was. He was the bridge. He was the seal of good housekeeping that enabled the Christian right to come on board.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, you know, but to go into your first question about the surprise of how ambitious he was and how willing he was to cut deals when he needed to, I mean it shouldn&#8217;t have been a surprise because the biggest deal and the biggest sort of Faustian bargain that he&#8217;s made was getting on the ticket with Donald Trump, who, of course, defines everything that Christian evangelicals say that they dislike, you know? His willingness to make that deal should have tipped everybody off.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You were able to get some pretty powerful quotes or assertions from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He, of course, is the Democratic senator from Rhode Island and one of the things that he said to you was that if Mike Pence were to become president, that the government would be run by the Koch brothers. Maybe you can unpack that and explain the connection between — because the Koch brothers aren&#8217;t known as fanatical Christian supremacists.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> No, I mean and, so, isn&#8217;t that interesting? The Koch&#8217;s are libertarians, or you could call them neoliberals. They are supposedly people who believe in kind of social liberalism. But there they are having sponsored the career of Mike Pence. And I think it&#8217;s a real tip off to what the Koch&#8217;s really care about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The issue that matters to them is not any of the social issues, no matter what they&#8217;re saying. What matters to them is allowing business to take over the power in the country, and particularly their own business. So, they&#8217;re pushing back on regulations, and they&#8217;re pushing back on taxes and trying to shrink the power of the government and replace it with their own power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Mike Pence has been willing to carry their water on that. I hadn&#8217;t realized, despite writing “Dark Money,” a book about the Kochs, I hadn&#8217;t realized the extent to which they were working hand-in-glove with Pence and vice versa and how it began.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it really goes back to 2009 in earnest. I mean it starts before then, in his working for think tanks that are funded by corporations and huge right-wing donors such as the Kochs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But in 2009, there was a piece of legislation moving forward in Congress that was a huge threat to Koch Industries. And that was a tax on carbon pollution, something that would make the fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries pay for what they were doing to the environment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Pence really took up their cause in 2009, and he echoed their talking points. He took a petition that was created by the Koch&#8217;s main political group, Americans for Prosperity, and he got tons of signatures on it in Congress and eventually managed to help kill that bill in the Senate so it never happened. And also to kind of permanently align the Republican Party against doing anything to try to deal with climate change. That was a gift of major proportions to Koch Industries. That cemented his relationship with the Kochs, and they then started just pouring money into him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They sponsored the next phases of his career and they really began to push for the idea of Pence himself becoming a presidential candidate and they were hoping it would come out that way. But Pence kind of screwed it up. He goes back to Indiana, becomes governor and he&#8217;s really a failure. And he makes decisions and takes positions that hurt him so much that he can&#8217;t run for president right away.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You point out that Mike Pence was in Congress for twelve years and never, never once authored a successful bill. That&#8217;s kind of astonishing when you realize like this guy was basically a failure in getting any legislation passed. However, he used every platform he had, not to be good at that job, but to be kind of a shock troop for whoever his funders were or wherever the support was coming from that he thought would most put him in a prime position to gain national recognition or national power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> He actually rose to a pretty high position in the leadership, the number three position of the Republican house, and he used that position also to push the Republican Party far, far, to the right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you find him very early on supporting the rise of the Tea Party and speaking out at Tea Party rallies and talking about defunding the whole government. He wanted to defund Planned Parenthood or he was going to shut down the government, he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mike Pence:\u003c/strong> We repealed Obamacare, lock, stock, and barrel on the floor of the House of Representatives. And we voted to cut spending to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels, defunding Obamacare and ending all public funding for Planned Parenthood of America. [audience cheers and applause] That&#8217;s what we voted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> So, he&#8217;s taking these radical positions that, at the time, were considered shocking. But he&#8217;s part of this whole effort to push the Republican Party in line with its far-right economic interests and push it further and further to the right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I read your piece and I get the sense that he&#8217;s kind of this far-right wing, almost Manchurian Candidate, where it&#8217;s like they&#8217;ve programmed someone, you know, that can pass as kind of a Christian for the needs of convincing people that he&#8217;s with them. But really he seems to do whatever the Koch brothers tell him to right now, or whoever else is paying the bills.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> Well there is an economic, fiscal side of the conservatism he espouses and people hadn&#8217;t paid that much attention to it. And it&#8217;s just as radical as his views are on social issues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, many of the people that work for him are people who come directly out of the Koch world. So, which to me was very interesting in part because I really believe that the reason that Trump was elected was because he broke with the orthodoxy of the far-right donors. They had moved so far away from the base that I think there was an opening for Trump to run on, to be more of a populist and to say things like “you need Social Security, you need Medicare.” These things were ideas that really appealed to the base of the Republican Party, and to many Americans who weren&#8217;t even that political.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he also talked about the corruption of the government and how he was going to stick it to the big donors, and specifically stick it to the Kochs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But he hasn&#8217;t done that. So I was interested in why. And, in particular, I think part of the reason is that he&#8217;s naive about government he has no experience in government, he&#8217;s bored by the details. And who is at his side who really does understand it? It&#8217;s Mike Pence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, Mike Pence runs the transition and fills the Trump Administration with people who are really Koch people. And so even though Trump has run a campaign that&#8217;s populist, he&#8217;s running a government that is Koch-ian in its nature, and more, and more so. I mean we see it with the so-called tax reform plan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Because you really got an infiltration going on in the Trump Administration by the big old-donor interests that have been trying to grab control for decades now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Talk about how Mike Pompeo ends up as CIA director and his connections to Pence and the Koch brothers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> The reporting on this comes partly from a number of people I interviewed who were inside the transition team. And, one of them in particular was saying to me, &#8220;Mike Pompeo was not even on the radar for Trump. He wouldn&#8217;t have known him from anybody else.&#8221; Until like a couple days before he actually appointed him to be running the CIA. He came in, he had a nice interview with Trump, and like a day or two later was named to run the CIA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He didn&#8217;t know — you know Trump wouldn&#8217;t have known where he came from. But where did he come from? He was the congressman from Wichita, Kansas. He was the Koch&#8217;s Congressman, someone whose business the Koch&#8217;s had helped support.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within the Administration he and Mike Pence are very close. And Pence has hosted an evangelical Bible study group that&#8217;s for cabinet members and Pompeo often comes to it. And it&#8217;s led by a preacher named Ralph Drollinger who has been incredibly controversial. In California, he wrote some essays that suggested that women who served in the state legislature were sinners if they had children because they were leaving their children at home to do public service and that that was literally a sin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yeah, I mean, talk about someone who&#8217;s got sort of anti-female, old fashioned and almost dark age ideas of women, that would be Ralph Drollinger. And there he is because Pence sponsored him, running a Bible study group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Though it&#8217;s interesting, there is a female member of it, too, someone who you&#8217;ve written about, Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, and she attends these sessions but presumably her children are not little and at home.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You talked to Steve Bannon for this piece, which I thought was quite interesting that Bannon agreed to talk to you, although in some ways maybe not surprising because Bannon now is threatening to try to run Senate candidates against everybody except Ted Cruz. He&#8217;s his own particular kind of force. But Bannon was the big one who was saying, you know, the globalists inside the administration are the ones that Trump has to worry about and the globalists in the deep state. What were the insights you gained from Steve Bannon about everything that&#8217;s happened in the nine or ten months of Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> Well I mean specifically what Bannon said to me I thought was just amazing which was: He feared that Pence would be a president who would be owned by the Kochs. The thing is that Bannon has long been a critic of the Koch brothers because Bannon sees himself as a new kind of nationalist populist and he sees the Kochs as hurting middle class people. And so, he&#8217;s in a different place. It&#8217;s not to say that he doesn&#8217;t have his own corporate sponsors — in fact, his biggest backer is Robert Mercer, the hedge fund magnate. But Mercer is more of a nationalist and a populist — I guess, to some extent, it&#8217;s hard to know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But at any rate, Bannon comes out is as a critic of the sort of big corporate donors who he sees as pulling the party away from his people, the kind of working class and middle class white guys of the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, one of the people that I&#8217;ve written a lot about, Erik Prince, is one of the names, the founder of the Blackwater mercenary company, one of the names that has been floated as a potential candidate on Bannon&#8217;s slate, if you will — possibly in Michigan, but it looks more likely in in Wyoming. And Erik Prince would regularly call into Steve Bannon&#8217;s radio show on Breitbart and pontificate on all sorts of issues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Steve Bannon:\u003c/strong> Turn to Erik Prince. Give us, Erik, a professional in this area. If you want to take the fight to ISIS, if we want to destroy ISIS, if they&#8217;re the existential threat that they say they are to us, what do we do?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Erik Prince:\u003c/strong> Well, here&#8217;s what the Trump administration needs to do because I can&#8217;t imagine the Clinton administration contemplating actually ending the ISIS scourge. It&#8217;s not just a matter of cutting off the head of the snake, it&#8217;s about chewing up and destroying the entire snake.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s sort of was like akin to like Bin Laden&#8217;s guys are dropping a tape off with Al Jazeera. Erik Prince would like call into Steve Bannon&#8217;s show. And I would imagine that Erik Prince fully has bought into Bannon&#8217;s kind of world view, you know, particularly when it comes to kind of right-wing, libertarian, populist nationalist tendencies. What&#8217;s your sense overall of what Bannon is doing right now, given that he&#8217;s become such a prominent figure and clearly has his own following?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> One of the things that Bannon has been fighting is what he calls the Empire Project and when he was in the White House, he was pushing back against the idea of sort of the endless war in endless number of countries, which he sees as taking the lives of too many of the kinds of people who he is championing. And he was trying to privatize some of these conflicts and reduce the defense spending, supposedly — I mean this was the idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And he so he was pushing the idea that is friend Erik Prince would use his private mercenary company to take over at least security in some of these projects, and the military was dead set against it and created huge fights, but that&#8217;s one place where the two of them are allied.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Erik Prince also was a financier of Mike Pence&#8217;s political career. And, in fact, in 2004, in the aftermath of the Blackwater operatives being killed in Fallujah and strung up from the bridge, Mike Pence organized the welcome reception for Erik Prince on to Capitol Hill and that&#8217;s really when Erik Prince&#8217;s mercenary business took off. And it was Mike Pence that welcomed him there, which is interesting given that Pence and Bannon seemed to have been on the opposite ends of the spectrum ideologically within the Trump Administration. I would have thought that Pence would have also sort of, on this issue, joined forces with Bannon to say, &#8220;Hey, General Mattis, you should consider our buddy Erik Prince here and what he&#8217;s proposing.&#8221; So, that to me is fascinating —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> I actually don&#8217;t think, I think you&#8217;re on to something there. Because I don&#8217;t think that Pence was dead-set against Prince&#8217;s idea. Pence attends the principals committee meetings which are where, you know, that the most important foreign policy arguments take place within the White House. And my sense was, and I think Bannon said to me at some point, that Pence was no fan of what he called the “empire project,” meaning the sort of endless expansion of these wars, and that Pence was asking some tough questions about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s not to say that Pence was backing Prince particularly, either. I mean the thing about going back to the very beginning of the questions you raised, the thing about Pence is that he&#8217;s kind of weasel-y about many positions. You know he&#8217;s not someone who you see an incredibly strong backbone, who gets out front and tells, for instance, president Trump when he&#8217;s wrong. He&#8217;s very careful and very behind the scenes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But anyway, so they may have had more common ground on that than people realize.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Who brought Pence and Trump together and how did Pence end up on that ticket? \u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> Well, to some extent, it was the Trump kids who really created that shotgun marriage, and according to the people that I was interviewing, Jared Kushner in particular had a longstanding family grievance against Chris Christie, who had prosecuted his father when Chris Christie was the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And so there was kind of a personal beef there. But yet, Trump, it seems, really liked Christie and was kind of leaning that way. I actually interviewed Trump during that period and he sounded very torn and it turns out that even after Trump had had a sort of, what was supposed to have been the big coming together with Pence — they&#8217;d had dinner and then they&#8217;d had a family breakfast together and the Trump family kids came in and everybody was sort of on the same playbook and word came out that Pence was going to take the job, as he said, “in a heartbeat” — that very night, apparently, Trump called Chris Christie and continued sort of the romance and was saying, you know, &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; And Christie said, &#8220;Ready for what?&#8221; And Trump said, &#8220;To do this thing with me.&#8221; And Christie said, &#8220;Are you asking?&#8221; And Trump sort of said, &#8220;Well, are you ready?&#8221; And, you know it was this kind of endless flirtation, and, &#8220;Stay by your phone,&#8221; Trump said to Christie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was like he couldn&#8217;t quite get himself to be comfortable with Pence. And even after they named to Pence publicly, Trump was still asking his advisers, you know, &#8220;Can I get out of this? Can I back out of it?&#8221; Now I got to be fair, though, to say since then, you know, Trump has been fully on board with Pence and considers it one of his best decisions, apparently, according to many people who I interviewed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the description he&#8217;s given about why he thinks Pence is so great what Pence was speaking at the Republican National Convention. And I talked to Newt Gingrich who was behind the scenes talking to Trump when Pence was speaking, and Trump turned to him and said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he perfect? He looks like he was sent by central casting.&#8221; So, Trump loves the way Pence looks like a vice president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well that sounds like the thing you&#8217;re really looking for, someone that just looks like a vice president. However, it underscores something that another historian you interviewed said that Pence is basically the sycophant-in-chief. He really is used by Trump on a regular basis. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a vice president carted out as though he&#8217;s at a pep rally to introduce the president anywhere near the numbers that Trump has carted Pence out. It&#8217;s almost like he puts him in this position that&#8217;s intended to say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my carnival barker or here&#8217;s my hype man that&#8217;s going to come out for a couple minutes and then the real king shows up.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> You know, one of the people I talked to, I tried to speak to some former vice presidents, and one in particular, Walter Mondale, found it so demeaning because Mondale actually tried to negotiate a contract when he became vice president with Jimmy Carter to make the role into a more substantial role, and something that&#8217;s more dignified. But he&#8217;s watching Pence, and he said to me, &#8220;You know: what&#8217;s he doing? I ask myself every day.&#8221; And he was, he looks at Pence as sort of acting like an emcee for the president, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s not stupid; it&#8217;s shrewd. He is the member of the White House team that has not gotten in trouble, as far as we know, with the president. He knows that the president likes to be flattered, and you know, you can see, probably biding his time. And that&#8217;s why I ended the piece with the quote from the Bible that Pence keeps over his mantle in the vice-presidential residence, which talks about how God has his future in mind.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Mike Pence seems to have also been put in a position, particularly with the General Flynn situation, where either he was being lied to and then was sent to the wolves, basically, to repeat the lie in public, or he did know and took a bullet essentially for the president&#8217;s reputation, or the reputation of the Administration. Is that your sense?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> I mean it&#8217;s hard to know for sure. There&#8217;s one meeting that would clarify the answer to that and we don&#8217;t know exactly what happened there. But Pence was in a meeting at the White House when Trump announced that he wanted to get rid of James Comey, as the head of the FBI and he was angry about Comey doing an investigation into him, and the Russian ties. And they cooked up the idea that they would get the Justice Department to go out front and recommend that he get rid of Comey, and that would give him some cover to do it. And it wouldn&#8217;t just look like obstruction of justice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Pence was in that meeting, but until we really know what he said, what he heard, what the conversation was like, it&#8217;s very hard to know for sure whether he was, you know, party to obstruction or whether somehow he absented himself at the right moments. It&#8217;s just really hard to know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But any rate he came out and said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MP:\u003c/strong> Let me be very clear that the president&#8217;s decision to accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General to remove Director Comey as the head of the FBI was based solely and exclusively on his commitment to the best interest of the American people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> There were a few little weasel words there that give him some outs, but he basically spread the party line that gave the president cover and then of course the president came out just a few hours later and said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s a showboat. He&#8217;s a grandstander. I was going to fire Comey. My decision. There&#8217;s no good time to do it, by the way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> Which left Pence out there looking like a, you know, complete chump, or a liar, and I think you have to know more before you can really say for sure, and I think we may know more at some point because I think Mueller&#8217;s going to go into that meeting very carefully and hopefully it will be more transparent and then we&#8217;ll see.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s a level of arrogance about the Russia investigation, specifically on Trump&#8217;s part that he you know he himself has this arrogance about it, where either he knows that there&#8217;s nothing there that&#8217;s going to stick or he just seems to believe that he&#8217;ll be able to weather it with his Twitter account and by lying — I mean what&#8217;s your sense of what&#8217;s going to happen there. I mean are they going to get something to stick to Trump himself?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> Who knows? I mean I&#8217;m not like in the prediction business. But I did interview Tony Schwartz who wrote “The Art of the Deal” for Trump, and one of the things he talks about is how for Trump, truth is so malleable. You know, he doesn&#8217;t care really, what&#8217;s true, what&#8217;s not true, what should be true — it&#8217;s all kind of the same for him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, that&#8217;s not how the courts work, though.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JM:\u003c/strong> No, it&#8217;s not. It seems like at the moment you know Mueller is pushing very hard against Paul Manafort, and probably against General Mike Flynn, that seems to be where he&#8217;s most likely to find sort of legal violations. But there is the possibility of an obstruction case here: obstruction by Trump, and potentially obstruction by Pence, neither of them are off the hook.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean, one thing I can say about being a Washington reporter for The New Yorker is there&#8217;s not been a single uninteresting day these days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jane Mayer we&#8217;re going to leave it there.

Our goal is to try to get over 2,000 members this year that have become sustaining supporters of this program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We are just blown away by the level of support that we&#8217;ve already been offered and we are so close to that goal that we&#8217;ve set for ourselves of 2,000 members, sustaining members, of Intercepted by the end of this calendar year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you&#8217;re out there and you appreciate the show, when you are in a financial position to support this program, particularly for someone or some people who aren&#8217;t in a financial position to support it, your donation to this show keeps it free for everyone to listen to. Maybe you want to send a pledge note on behalf of a person in your life, or a group that is engaged in a social justice struggle in your local community. Maybe you want to do a challenge grant where you pool together with some friends and you pool your resources and you say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll match dollar for dollar any contributions under this mission, up to $2,000 dollars or up to $5,000.&#8221; Whatever level you can pledge, we really appreciate it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once again, I&#8217;ll shut up. Back to the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And we are back here on Intercepted. When the refugee crisis on Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere is discussed in the U.S. media, it&#8217;s often portrayed simply as masses of people fleeing the violence of groups like ISIS or al Qaeda or al Shabaab.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But U.S. military actions, including the intense bombings that have taken place in a number of countries, under both president Obama and president Trump have played a major role in creating the conditions that have forced so many people to flee. Not just ISIS, not just al Qaeda, but the United States government. So, too, has the U.S. government and corporate support for dictators around the world. Support for repressive security forces and this massive flow of arms sales, both illicit and perfectly legal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Add to this, then, the increasingly deadly role that Russian forces are playing, particularly in Syria, and the world is witnessing a horrifying spike in the number of people documented to have been forcibly displaced from their homes. More than 65 million people according to the United Nations. From Syria, to South Sudan and Central America&#8217;s northern triangle, more people than ever are fleeing violence, persecution, human rights abuses that are caused by their own governments, by terror groups and by outside forces. Like the United States, or Iran, or Russia. They&#8217;re also escaping the sometimes-lethal impact of climate change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, political powers across the world, including in the United States and Europe, are building more walls or proposing the building of more walls, implementing harsh anti-immigrant and anti-refugee policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, far-right politicians are using the refugee crisis to incite xenophobic fears which then can lead to hate crimes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chinese artist and human rights activist Ai Weiwei has spent his entire adult life under the watch of Chinese intelligence and security forces. And he&#8217;s widely viewed as one of the most well-known dissidents in China.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ai Weiwei has a new film out that paints a harrowing portrait of the scale of these mass migrations that we&#8217;re witnessing. The film is called Human Flow. And he timed the film&#8217;s release with a gigantic public installation of his artworks throughout New York City. It&#8217;s called “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” From a golden cage in New York&#8217;s Central Park, to fences erected at bus stops, and two hundred photographs from refugee camps, Ai Weiwei&#8217;s migrant-themed works around New York City forced their way into high traffic areas to disrupt the flow of people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, Intercepted&#8217;s production assistant Elise Swain spoke to onlookers at one of those installations in Washington Square Park. Here&#8217;s what people had to say about what they saw and felt being next to the artwork.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 1:\u003c/strong> So, it looks like a giant bird cage in the middle of the Washington Square Park arch, and at the bottom of the bird cage, about halfway through in the center, is a cutout mirrored on the inside.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 2:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s really beautiful. I think when you stand back, it does look like two people, for me personally.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 3:\u003c/strong> To me, it looks like maybe two people, or maybe one person with a backpack on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 4:\u003c/strong> Like, this nice silhouette, if you were a human being, or more of one human being, walking like in a tunnel all together, we were all like squeezing, coming through.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 5:\u003c/strong> When you go inside it, you see your reflection, but you&#8217;re like – you&#8217;re distorted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 6:\u003c/strong> But I think that reflection is pretty cool in terms of not only us feeling like there’s other people who are going through hell in their countries —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 7:\u003c/strong> This is the age of people like putting fences to prevent people from like crossing borders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 6:\u003c/strong> And have to be in a cage for some reason as a protection of this crazy world we live in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 8:\u003c/strong> Confinement. That&#8217;s what I think the cage is. Because I&#8217;ve been in cages before. So —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Elise Swain:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s not a good feeling.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bystander 8:\u003c/strong> Hell no!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ai Weiwei&#8217;s new film, Human Flow, is playing in cities across the United States and soon will be launching globally. And he joins us now. Ai Weiwei, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ai Weiwei:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is such an important film. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a film that has portrayed, in a human way, the idea of numbers and mass forced migration. When you set out to make this film, was that part of what you were trying to make real to people who are not there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> At the very beginning, I was very frustrated by the situation and have almost no knowledge about what the refugees were about, so I jumped in and started with my iPhone to shooting the people getting off the shore from the Syrian war. And I realize this is going to be a large task to take, and, you know, it is always such a complexity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Human Flow:\u003c/strong> This extraordinary event that has unfolded has also impacted Europe in many ways. We&#8217;re here right now on Lesbos Island. This is the point when 1/2 a million people, most of them refugees, set foot and entered Europe, an extraordinary way that people have been coming through. In just the last year alone, over 1 million have come to Europe through the Mediterranean Sea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And although these are movements that we haven&#8217;t seen in decades, in fact, it hasn&#8217;t been since the Second World War that so many have fled and come to Europe. It&#8217;s still something that we need to consider in the global context, where so many millions are actually displaced.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> So, it ended up we travelled in 23 nations, 40 camps, and interviewed 600 people. And come with 900 hours of footage. And the situation grows very dramatically. You have to do several locations at the same time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now the film doesn&#8217;t really have recurring characters. You return to the scene, for instance, on the Macedonian border. How did you decide how to tell that story?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I guess most refugee films are really focused on an individual character or a family or, you know, a story. As artists, you can have a painting or you can have a photograph or you can have something, you know, more abstract, or in between. Sometimes it gets very large scale, and sometimes very intimate details. So, it&#8217;s a collage. It&#8217;s — I would say it&#8217;s like a broken mirror. You have a lot of fragmentary flecks, angles about the reality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On a human level, how did it affect you? Not just what you showed on camera, because you&#8217;re filming with your phone and you&#8217;re also being filmed, but if you ignore the cameras, just as a human being, what was it like for you to witness what you saw and to be among these people that are forced from their homes?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I was also a kind-of refugee. My father was exiled as an anti-revolutionary poet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I grew up with him in 20 years in very hard conditions. So, when I met those people, they&#8217;re so familiar, whatever they do there. You know, their condition. They&#8217;re, they&#8217;re both physically and mentally can see myself in them or see them in myself. So, it&#8217;s easy for me to communicate and to take part of this whole production.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the, the lighter moments in the film. You&#8217;re buying mandarins, or oranges, on the back of the — from a guy on the back of a truck, it looks like, or at a table. And my perception of it was that you were, you knew that he was overcharging you kind of, in a very interesting way, negotiated with him. I used that sort of as a metaphor for how these people are being ripped off, in general. Was that at all what you were doing with that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Yeah. I think we carefully selected a part, and to have myself in my interaction with them is always serving some purpose, like, I try to pick up this fruit, rather than the other one, he&#8217;s trying to give me some of what he wants to give to me. And it&#8217;s very much like selections of refugees in the European process, and also he kind of thought my money could be fake, he look at the — to examine the money. So, all of those instances, it&#8217;s very little, but it shows a quality or intention about this kind of distrust, or selectively to always chose in those situations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You portray, in a very strong way, by using the Macedonian border when the European Union countries started shutting it down. Talk about that particular camp that you were in on the Macedonian border and the fate of the people that were there. Why did they come there and what happened?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Most refugees when they landed on Greece, Greece is not a country they want to be in. They want to go to Germany or Sweden or, you know, all those nations already have more open attitude, or maybe better conditions for working.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So they have look, walking across this so-called Balkan Road. So, the Macedonian border, between Greece, is the place where they&#8217;re being stopped. You know, they suddenly shut off the fence, the door, and all people, the flow stops there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, accumulated about 13-14,000 people for months without an explanation, or even, it&#8217;s very limited life support. So that&#8217;s why we paid a lot of attention to the condition.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Human Flow Clip: \u003c/strong>The officials came here. And told them, &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re going to get papers to continue, so you&#8217;re going to be deported. Either you go voluntarily or we arrest you.&#8221; And yesterday it started with police coming here and actively arresting people. There are very afraid of being brought back. I mean there&#8217;s a reason why these people are here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know the president of the United States, he&#8217;s a big fan of building walls and fences.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> And also, not only building walls, but also going to push away many immigrants that have been living in the United States for decades, or even born here. Many of them even contributed to the U.S. economy. You know, they do jobs nobody wants to do. And so those people are going to be pushed away by the new policy, and he has this travelling ban also.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Donald J. Trumps is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country&#8217;s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> And also, the U.S. accepts very little amount of refugees. You really think, it&#8217;s kind of shameful for such a big nation, powerful nation, the most powerful nation on the earth, but rather not bear the responsibility — do not have the vision, do not have the leadership in dealing with a humanitarian crisis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s your biggest concern in China right now when it comes to basic liberties?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> China has been establishing this new government for sixty-eight years. But still, they never trust it’s own people they never let them vote. They don&#8217;t have independent judicial system, and the Army doesn&#8217;t belong to the country, but it belongs to the party. And also they don&#8217;t have an independent media, you know, it&#8217;s always under very heavy censorship, every aspect. And I don&#8217;t know how long they can survive that way, but they have always been like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Are you personally still facing surveillance and monitoring when you&#8217;re inside China?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Oh yes, when I&#8217;m inside China, I should be the most watched person, or under the most surveillance, strongest surveillance possible, because that&#8217;s what they do. And they still see me as a potential dangerous person.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When you just think about it on a basic level, why are they so afraid of you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I think I present or reflect this notion of freedom. Individual freedom, and the freedom of speech, and also about creativity, are really questionable in this totalitarian society which really threatens the fundamental possibility for them to stay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What were your thoughts when it became clear that Donald Trump had won the election and was going to be president of the United States. What was your immediate sort of thought about him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s the kind of natural outcome of long years, giving up a political consciousness in a general sense. You know, the U.S. has been — or, not only the U.S., but also Europe has been in peaceful time for decades. And they enjoyed this kind of huge prosperity. But at the same time, intellectually, had given up true ideas or thinking about what globalization is about. So, then, it&#8217;s very easy to be used by politicians. For me, it&#8217;s not a surprise. Because you can see many, many places in Europe, also, have this kind of trend or tendency to have a far-right moment and come to power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When you think about the Chinese government, do you think of it in terms of left wing or right wing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I think they are all the time right wing. There&#8217;s no left wing. Also, there&#8217;s no left-wing movement in the society, because, yes, there&#8217;s a few figures, which reflect this kind of fight, but it can never be a movement in terms of thinking or argument. You know, there&#8217;s no arguing. Whoever comes out is going to be immediately put in jail, or, you know, has no chance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> China is such a powerful capitalist economy and is making so much of the goods for the United States and no one ever talks about the human rights in China. Trump just talks about, &#8220;China is ripping us off financially.&#8221; But the U.S. economy, in large part, runs because of cheap Chinese labor that has at its center no workers’ rights and terrible working conditions. But, in this country, when no one is talking about that, except here and there sometimes you have it. But artists sometimes talk about it, occasionally an article is written, but the main focus on China and the United States is: China&#8217;s becoming very powerful and they&#8217;re ripping us off financially.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I think this is since not only this administration, but the previous ones. They enjoy the deals that are made in China, and the profit, and they benefit is huge, because it exploits those nations who don&#8217;t have human rights, you know? In many senses, it only can be done when the people as in this kind of situation, they ruin partially by doing this kind of business here ruins the human rights condition and also the environmental pollution is everywhere in China. Food, water, and education is pretty bag, and the government is completely corrupted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, of course, the U.S. very clearly knows that, and they enjoy that, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right and it&#8217;s part of why the United States is able to do what it does in the world, is because they don&#8217;t care about those issues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s true. It survives because those nations function like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As I&#8217;ve followed your work over the years, and I always find it so fascinating that you&#8217;re perceived as a threat because it feels like the reaction of the Chinese state to you is like from a different era. Like, they&#8217;re making you more powerful, more influential because they&#8217;re targeting you. And it&#8217;s like: why don&#8217;t they get that? That their action against you elevates your platform? Are you that big of a threat to them?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I think fundamentally I’m a big threat to any power because I&#8217;m questioning the essence of why they&#8217;re there, and it&#8217;s a very harsh argument and a threat to their existence. But they also sense it because I represent, it&#8217;s not me, but I represent the new intention to make a change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why do you like working with your phone as vehicle for shooting video?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s just coming into — I think for artists, you conceptually are always very clear what kind of image you want, and also, you know, you think anything can make an image which can be powerful. That doesn&#8217;t have to be super-high quality cameras, which exist everywhere now, but it also can be a simple gesture, or close-range shooting, because filming is almost like a street fight. If you really street fight, you don&#8217;t need some powerful weapons. You maybe — you grab a sand, you use sand you have a brick, you use a brick. It&#8217;s really about the moment, and that little thing you have to capture, you know?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When you&#8217;re in the United States and you&#8217;re traveling around, what&#8217;s the vibe that you feel? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s different in different places but how does it feel in this country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> After being back to China from the United States for 20-some years, 24 years, then come back to Europe and the United States, I think this world is really, we are living in different worlds. And, if you go to South America, if you go to Africa, if you go the Middle East, it is really — we are really living in several different kinds of worlds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And generally speaking, the people living here are quite spoiled, because of longtime lacking of any kind of challenge, and I think challenge is necessary for, for a nation or an individual. Without challenge, we all become spoiled.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you think should be done with all of these people that have had to flee their homes in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia? What would a human response look like to any of this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> I think there are several levels that need to be done. One, is at the top, political level, globally, those leaderships, the powerful nations, they should make a decision to stop the war. You know? To stop the famine, which is not difficult. All those wars, represents the interests from others. As we all know, if we look at the top lists of who is selling those weapons and to whom, you know? It&#8217;s just, like, if you follow the money, then you see how this world is moving.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the U.S. certainly bears major responsibility in this matter, if you talk about the Iraq war, still, after decades, still Iraq is such a broken state, and they&#8217;re still fighting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Turkey. I mean the United States sold enormous quantities of weapons and military to Turkey to massacre and expel Kurds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Yes, Turkey also is a very unstable situation. And many, many nations, it&#8217;s not just one or two. And, also in Syria, has all foreign involvement in there, so makes that well, 100,000 people as casualties, and pushes a few million people out. So, if we can&#8217;t stop those wars, and continuously build arms and we&#8217;re selling arms, what do you expect? All of those are made for killing people. I think the U.S. has been pulling down the bombs, larger than ever.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, Trump just used this huge bomb, that they called the MOAB, in Afghanistan. They were bragging about how great this big bomb was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW\u003c/strong>: Yeah. So, you can see people celebrating those killings, and also not talk about nuclear warfare. Those potential dangerous threats to humanities are always there, if they have any sincerity or care, they should just dismiss all those nuclear bombs. Now, why we need to have it — who do they want to kill with those devastating weapons?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Whose work right now do you respect or do you pay attention to, either artists or writers, musicians?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Sorry to say, I am very much interested in the artist, his name is Ai Weiwei, that&#8217;s who I pay full attention to.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Alright. Fair enough. Ai Weiwei, thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AW:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ai Weiwei is a Chinese artist and political dissident. His documentary, human flow, is out now, and his installations in New York City will be up until February 11th of 2018.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> After more than two decades of being a band, the veteran indie rock quartet Deerhoof thought they&#8217;d try something different. Two weeks before their fourteenth LP, Mountain Moves, was set to drop, they surprise released it on their website at a pay-what-you-want price. The entirety of the proceeds were then donated to the Emergent Fund, a nonprofit that benefits campaigns whose missions are to defend the rights of vulnerable communities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It could be said that the unpredictability of Deerhoof is both an ode to their solidly leftist do-it-yourself principles and idiosyncratic music, which seems to joyfully gallop between art pop and punk, and is something entirely of their own vibrant creation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Mountain Moves&#8221; by Deerhoof]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Our producer Jack D&#8217;Isidoro spoke with Deerhoof&#8217;s Greg Saunier about the songs of Mountain Moves, and the power of creativity during the Trump moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Greg Saunier:\u003c/strong> This is Greg, the drummer from Deerhoof. Yes, I would say that on Mountain Moves, maybe we were trying to be political with the songs. But we&#8217;ve had a lot of songs about war, a lot of songs about immigration. Our singer Satomi Matsuzaki is a first-generation immigrant from Japan to the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s like we&#8217;d like to make music that would make a person want to sit up straight, and like give them some energy, give them some strength, when there are many things in their day-to-day existence that are not only sapping their energy, but meant to sap their energy. There&#8217;s an economy of hopelessness, of producing hopelessness, that people are making money by creating hopelessness, creating a feeling of being overwhelmed and feeling that to even envision something better than what we have is completely preposterous and unrealistic and should be abandoned immediately.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Your Dystopic Creation Doesn&#8217;t Fear You&#8221; by Deerhoof]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Your Dystopic Creation Doesn&#8217;t Fear You&#8221; is kind of, I don&#8217;t know, I just remember how much fear-mongering was the strategy of both parties.

I mean that song was chorus like a kind of anthem about surviving a bad breakup. This one is more like meant to be a kind of anthem about surviving a government, that, depending on who you are, would prefer you to be dead. If you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s sick or injured, it&#8217;d be better if you would die. If you are the wrong race or wrong religion, it would be better if you were dead. And if you can survive long enough for the people currently flush with wealth and power to, themselves, pass away, then there&#8217;s some hope that the future may be better.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, it&#8217;s kind of a message to them to please stay strong and stay alive if you can.

This week on Intercepted: The most nuanced discussion you will hear on what we know, what we don’t know, and the challenge of criminally prosecuting anyone for actually conspiring with Russia to interfere in the election. New York Times reporter Charlie Savage and former federal prosecutor-turned-defense attorney Ken White of Popehat break down the recent indictment and plea deal and what it may mean for Trump. Savage also lays out the secret authorities Trump recently signed giving the military and CIA wider latitude to conduct drone strikes and night raids across the world. In the aftermath of the ambush and killing of four U.S. special forces soldiers in Niger and the terrorist attack that killed more than 300 people in Somalia, we take an in-depth look at U.S. militarism in Africa. Investigative journalist Nick Turse and Kenya scholar Samar Al-Bulushi take us into the world of the secret drone bases popping up on the continent, U.S. commandos and Washington-backed African forces operating under the guise of the war on terror. And musician Roberto Lange of Helado Negro performs and talks about the re-release of their album “Private Energy,” growing up in South Florida, and young people staying hopeful in the Trump era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chris Hayes:\u003c/strong> Today former Trump campaign chairman manager Paul Manafort was indicted and we learned that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos who pled guilty to lying to the FBI has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And former foreign policy adviser of Donald Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign Carter Page joins me now.

While the indictment alleges a wide range of criminal activity, it does not cite anything directly related to the Trump campaign and Russia. In fact, the indictment overwhelmingly deals with shady business that Manafort allegedly was conducting over an extended period of years before joining the Trump campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But that of course does not mean that Manafort may not be implicated in potential attempts by Trump or Trump officials to work with Russian sources to obtain information critical of Hillary Clinton, or the Democratic National Committee, or other unknown offers from Russia to help Trump. We haven&#8217;t seen the direct evidence of that, but it may well exist. Perhaps more significant than Manafort&#8217;s actual charges is the fact that Robert Mueller revealed to the public that a Trump foreign policy adviser named George Papadopoulos had pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an interview about his contacts with Russians that he believed to be closely connected to the Kremlin or Vladimir Putin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Papadopoulos, by the way, seems like a first-class imbecile on multiple fronts. First someone clearly told Papadopoulos that he was going to be hooking up with Russians closely connected to Vladimir Putin, including someone that Papadopoulos believed was a relative of Putin. Turns out that part was bullshit. It&#8217;s clear from the indictment and Papadopoulos&#8217; guilty plea about lying that he thought he could get dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of stolen e-mails in the possession of his Russian sources.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, maybe he did have good connections and maybe he didn&#8217;t. We don&#8217;t know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, it&#8217;s possible that Papadopoulos was also trying to make himself seem more connected, and, in turn, more valuable to Trump and his senior campaign officials than he actually was, and that maybe he inflated both his connections and who these people were that he was supposedly dealing with that were connected to Russia or Vladimir Putin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Papadopoulos has a track record of lying about his resume and some of his past work. He hardly seems to be the criminal mastermind of some grand plot to get the Russians to hack the elections — but still, it is significant. Papadopoulos&#8217; guilty plea and the fact that he&#8217;s cooperating in this investigation could mean serious trouble for actual senior members of the Trump campaign, including, but not limited to: Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., Sam Clovis, Paul Manafort, and possibly President Trump himself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The key question in all of this is what Trump and his senior officials believed Russia had to offer, what they tried to do to get it, and what they did with it, if they did get it, and on, and on, and on. But both Papadopoulos and Manafort could also provide testimony that alleges that Trump and others lied about a whole range of issues, including what they knew and when they knew it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For someone like Jeff Sessions who testified under oath about his knowledge of or involvement in dealings with Russia, this could be extremely bad news.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Al Franken:\u003c/strong> If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government, in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Attorney General Jeff Sessions:\u003c/strong> Senator Franken, I&#8217;m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians. And I&#8217;m unable to comment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AF:\u003c/strong> Very well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Was Jeff Sessions being truthful when he made the statements under oath? He better hope so. And Papadopoulos and Manafort could testify that he was lying so that could be a big deal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump may have lied about a whole series of things, he lies about what he had for dinner last night. But he may have lied about what was discussed when his son, and his son-in-law, and Paul Manafort were doing when they met with a Russian that they believed was connected to Putin. Remember that was this Russian lawyer?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump said, &#8220;Oh, it was just about international adoption, the Magnitsky Act.&#8221; Manafort was at that meeting, and he could testify that what Donald Trump said and what Don Trump Jr. said and what Jared Kushner said, that that was all false and that the aim of the meeting was actually to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the case but Manafort sure could say that. But Trump didn&#8217;t say any of these things that could potentially be lies under oath, so Trump can just call it fake news, fake news, fake news — no legal consequences.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What is clear at this point though is that Robert Mueller is just getting started. Papadopoulos&#8217; plea agreement and the Manafort indictment should cause serious concern for Trump. Just based on what they know, and the fact that they are under tremendous high stakes legal pressure from an aggressive prosecutor who has threatened, in the case of Paul Manafort, to make his life a living hell. But neither Papadopoulos nor Manafort have pled guilty to or been charged with conspiracy or espionage related to Russian election interference.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of this matters because the only relevant legal point on any of this was the following: Did Trump or his campaign break laws? By the way, collusion has no real widely accepted legal definition. Details about such collusion, as we&#8217;re now calling it, could come out that make it very clear that there was a plot here. But it might just be condemned in public opinion but not the courts. So that&#8217;s what a lot of this boils down to criminal conduct, or what many people seem to believe should be criminal conduct but isn&#8217;t under the law. And Trump, in his particular fashion, actually said things like this in public around the time his team was made aware of the possibility of obtaining info from Russians on Hillary Clinton that seems potentially relevant to either scenario.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> Russia, if you&#8217;re listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. \u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There will almost certainly be more indictments coming down the pike, and other cooperating witnesses. We know that there are some sealed indictments filed in sequential order with the Manafort and Papadopoulos filings. It will be interesting to see what they say and who the defendants are. And remember we have General Flynn floating around. He definitely knows where some of the bodies are buried. Is he cooperating? Wearing a wire? Or is he going to be charged with a crime. Same questions go for his son, Mike Flynn Jr.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lying to the FBI and being a corrupt businessman are not what this investigation is really about. It&#8217;s a probe into possible links between the Trump camp and Russia in an effort to influence the election. The government may never prove that there was criminal activity by Trump&#8217;s people related to this election, but rather that they engaged in activity many Americans find offensive, or immoral, or unpatriotic, but to prove it is criminal is a totally different beast. And that has been why I&#8217;ve been pushing for evidence since all of this broke. Let&#8217;s get to evidence of criminal activity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Many investigations into a major question in the public realm often produce indictments that have little or no relation to the bigger probe they were uncovered during the course of the probe. Catching people in lies can lead to bigger things. And that&#8217;s why Papadopoulos ultimately matters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it also matters what senior people, including possibly Trump himself, thought they were getting or could get and what they did about it. What passes as fact in the court of public opinion doesn&#8217;t necessarily hold up in the court of law. And none of us can simply will something to be true: that&#8217;s what the courts are supposed to do. Including in cases involving cartoonish villains like Donald Trump and his cronies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, maybe this will lead to indictments showing a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Vladimir Putin, or maybe it will simply uncover non-criminal activities that are deeply offensive to a lot of Americans. Time and evidence will tell. To break all of this down we&#8217;re joined by two people: Ken White is a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles and a former assistant U.S. attorney. He&#8217;s the main force behind the blog Popehat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Charlie Savage is an investigative reporter at the New York Times. He&#8217;s also the author of two really great books: “Takeover: The Return of the Imperial Presidency,” it was about the Bush era, and “Power Wars” which covered the Obama administration&#8217;s counterterrorism policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ken White, Charlie Savage, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ken White:\u003c/strong> Thank you. Happy to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Charlie Savage:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is the strategy that Robert Mueller is engaging in here with this indictment and also the plea agreement of Papadopoulos.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Of course Mueller is not talking to me, although if he&#8217;s out there listening, I&#8217;m happy to talk to you. But I would speculate that what he&#8217;s trying to do very hard is persuade Paul Manafort to flip and start cooperating and provide information about the Trump campaigns&#8217; interactions with the Russian government in exchange for leniency on these otherwise unrelated charges he was indicted with yesterday regarding his failure to register as a foreign agent, as lobbyist for Ukraine, and money laundering, and various other financial crimes related to that matter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It looks like he&#8217;s putting a lot of pressure on Manafort, saying “Now is the time to flip, like Papadopoulos did, and you may get yourself, if not out of hot water into more tepid water in exchange for cooperation.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What would make what people keep referring to as collusion illegal or a criminal conspiracy and not just trying to get opposition research in a way that many Americans certainly would find distasteful, maybe even immoral. But like what would they need to find in order to prove that there was actual criminal activity regarding working with Russian agents or people connected to Russia regarding the election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> It depends, I mean, they could use sort of generic statutes to the extent that anyone involved in communications with Russia made false statements to the United States government, made false statements to them in the course of the investigation. And you see those elements in both the Manafort indictment and Papadopoulos plea. And, to the extent they engaged in transactions that were concealing the nature of their relationship with the government, that could be it. But there&#8217;s no sort of general, broad definition of collusion. It would have to be — it&#8217;s not enough they just work with the Russians. They would have to demonstrate that they were affirmatively engaging with them and assisting them in making donations of something of value to a United States campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Charlie, if a political campaign, such as the Trump campaign learns that there are e-mails or communications that have been hacked or illicitly obtained by a foreign government and they&#8217;re aware that that is how this information was obtained, is it a crime for them to take possession of it and use it in their campaign to try to damage or score points against their political opponent?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> I mean all this is a very unprecedented territory, right? And so, I think a lot of legal commentators who have been trying to analyze where Mueller may be going or what certain facts would then lead to, if those facts turn out to be true, have been trying to reason by analogy without a lot of prior precedents to look to for guidance about what would fly in a courtroom, what wouldn&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, for example the theory that this could be a conspiracy to violate the law against foreign contributions to a domestic political campaign is definitely one of the ones that has been around. You see Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel to Obama who&#8217;s an election law specialist has been I think the principal proponent of that. What you&#8217;re getting at is another variant that you&#8217;ve heard kicked around out there which is — “Well, stealing of these e-mails is unlawful.” If the theft appears to have taken place before Trump campaign people were told that the Russians had e-mails related to Hillary Clinton but also, they seem to have learned that before the e-mails were disseminated via Wiki Leaks. And so, if they coordinated that in some way or took some sort of step to conceal it, could that implicate Americans involved in the Trump campaign in the crimes of the Russians? There&#8217;s not a super easy way to see that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One theory though that people have explored is there certain privacy violation crimes that are completed only at the point in which the public is shown private information. Perhaps then the crime was ongoing up to the point in which the, you know, the private e-mails were disseminated. But the whole thing is really sort of sui generis and, which means to say, we don&#8217;t have a lot of guidance from historical events to say “Clearly it would fit into this box neatly which has been tested over time.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Ken, you currently are a defense attorney. You, at one other point in your career were an assistant United States attorney. I&#8217;m wondering your read on what was made public about the Papadopoulos guilty plea and the plea agreement in the fact that he&#8217;s cooperating. Was there anything in the documents that were made public this week on his case that indicate to you any other criminal activity outside of lying to the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> Well there was lying to the FBI and there was also deleting his Facebook account in what might have been a very clumsy effort to conceal its contents from the FBI. But no, there wasn&#8217;t anything in there that I think yet crossed the line into any other crimes. But bear in mind that what we&#8217;re seeing both in the complaint and in the statement of facts supporting the plea was what the special counsel warned to put in there and they didn&#8217;t necessarily put gratuitous things in there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it&#8217;s possible they have more. But this move by the special counsel&#8217;s office to go out and roust people and then wind up charging them not with a substantive crime but with lying during the rousting is classic for a federal grand jury investigation. And actually, I misspoke. It was the FBI that did the initial rousting before the special counsel was even appointed. But this sort of demonstrates, as does the Manafort indictment, just how broad and flexible federal criminal law is and how often prosecutors can give in something that they don&#8217;t like, stretch and find something that makes it a crime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As a defense attorney if you were sort of tasked with working on the defense in this case from the White House. Let&#8217;s say that it is proven that they had these meetings with Russians and that they knew that they were potentially going to be taking custody of stolen e-mails, whether they were actually stolen or not, we don&#8217;t know. But let&#8217;s say that that&#8217;s what they believe that they were — is there a criminal defense to justify taking that information and using it in your political campaign?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW\u003c/strong>: The first element of the defense would be to get your clients to shut up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs.] Good luck with that one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> I mean because this is again a classic example of how people get themselves in trouble by lying to the FBI rather than by the underlying crime. Until you know what theory that the special counsel is going to go after, it&#8217;s a little difficult to say. I think that you would be watching for any indication that nothing of value was given by foreign nationals, which is one of the elements of the prohibition against foreign donations to a domestic campaign. I think you would be looking very carefully and policing all statements that have been made to any federal government entity in the course of the campaign to make sure that there were no false statements made that could be the hook for the criminal prosecution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is there&#8217;s something inherently criminal about taking possession of illicitly obtained e-mails, like we believe happened with the Russia hack and Hillary Clinton or the DNC?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> Under federal law, probably not. Inherently just taking possession of them. There&#8217;s not like a “receiving stolen property” that&#8217;s generic to federal law like there is for many states.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, you know, you could spin at some point a theory that they joined a conspiracy, a hacking conspiracy, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which is extremely broad and flexible. It really depends on what they say in the communication to the foreign nationals and what the communications demonstrate their intent is. But it&#8217;s certainly not a slam dunk, just because they knew it was stolen, that they took it. It really depends on what you can show their intent was and what they did with it, and especially if they did anything like encourage them to go back to the well and get more.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, you did have Donald Trump openly calling on the Russians to find Hillary Clinton&#8217;s 30,000 deleted emails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And that&#8217;s why if it is Russia, nobody even knows, it&#8217;s probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was political theater but I mean the timing of that, Charlie, was quite fascinating that you have Trump — it seems like he was aware that there was some degree of back channel communications or at least people very close to him, including his family members. And then he&#8217;s openly saying: Hey, Russia if you can find the 30,000 deleted e-mails, that would be great.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Well, so what we don&#8217;t know yet is what he was aware of, versus what people around him were aware of, and may or may not have conveyed to him. Seems like that should be knowable information, but that&#8217;s also probably the sort of thing exactly that Bob Mueller&#8217;s hoping Paul Manafort for will flip and then provide, because he would be the one that in the best position to fill in those blanks. Part of what you&#8217;re talking about is the timeline here, that sort of we&#8217;re having more and more data points filled in of this very interesting period from sort of the spring of 2016 through the late summer of 2016, where now we know there is the Papadopoulos flirtation and offer, or at least a suggestion, that they had all these e-mails long before we had previously known people on the American side knew that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Earlier that month we had the now-famous Trump Tower meeting on, I think, June 9th, a couple days after that is when Julian Assange first reveals that he has just come into possession of Hillary related e-mails that he finds fantastic. So, these things line up in a suspicious way, but Mueller is going to do more than just say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s some dots, why don&#8217;t we connect them with our intuitions.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And of course, Ken, Donald Trump is not under oath when he&#8217;s tweeting or when he&#8217;s speaking to the media, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions has testified under oath and has repeatedly said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff Sessions:\u003c/strong> Well, let me just say this without hesitation that I conducted no improper discussions with Russians at any time regarding a campaign or any other item facing this country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At least in one case it shows that Sessions was in a meeting on March 31st, 2016 at which Papadopoulos reportedly explained, &#8220;He had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marcy Wheeler writing that it “shows that Papadopoulos kept a number of campaign officials in the loop on his efforts to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, though they secretly determine that the meeting should be one low-level person in the campaign so as not to send any signal.” This issue of Sessions potentially being contradicted by Papadopoulos about what he knew and when he knew it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> Well, sure, again, you&#8217;re off to the races. You&#8217;ve got false statements to the federal government and you&#8217;ve got potentially perjury. I think it would be at that point a difficult case depending on Sessions&#8217; exact language in his testimony since it&#8217;s a little cloudy what collusion means. I mean collusion is sort of like the term we&#8217;re using to talk about this whole affair. It&#8217;s not really, in itself, a thing. There&#8217;s no federal law of “collusion” or something like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the trick would be to determine how precise Sessions&#8217; language was and how precisely he said something that you can definitely contradict and, you know, prove that he knowingly told a lie.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How would you describe to someone who knows nothing about this and is coming into it what has actually been proven about the relationship between Trump campaign officials and individuals connected to the Kremlin or working on behalf of the Kremlin?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> I mean it seems fairly clear and beyond reasonable dispute that there was an organized Russian effort to interfere with the 2016 election to help Trump, and hurt Clinton, through a variety of means and — ranging from these Facebook ads and so forth that were bought in rubles, to pretending to be, you know, Black Lives Matter, organizing rallies and so forth, or just sort of taking existing tensions that might have the effect of suppressing leftwing turnout and ratcheting them up to the apparent theft of the emails and dissemination of them through WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Your question is aimed more at sussing out what we know and don&#8217;t know about Trump campaign knowledge of, and coordination with, or lack there of. At this point the biggest indication of that in the public domain had been the Don Jr. emails that led to the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 where he was told that the meeting was about the Russian government&#8217;s efforts to help his father and he didn&#8217;t express surprise that there were such efforts, it&#8217;s always been sort of puzzling.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now we learn that other elements of the campaign had already been in dialogue with people they believed at least were aligned to the Russian government, both in terms of setting up a meeting which doesn&#8217;t sound like collusion, that sounds like diplomacy or laying the grounds for diplomacy, but also that they knew that there was dirt and e-mails related to Clinton as early as April.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That still doesn&#8217;t get you to active participant in something, rather than passive beneficiary to something. But we don&#8217;t know what Mueller&#8217;s going to find, we don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s already found. He keeps getting closer to that, but certainly this is a story that&#8217;s unfolding not a story that&#8217;s over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is the evidence that is publicly available that you&#8217;ve seen as someone paying close attention to this that would stand up in a court of law and what does it show so far?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> I have to agree with Charlie. I think there&#8217;s evidence that people in the Trump campaign believed they were communicating with the Russians and believed that they were offering information about Hillary Clinton including e-mails. I don&#8217;t think that the evidence of coordination or of higher up in the Trump campaign is there yet, but it&#8217;s certainly enough for them to pursue. In terms of, you know, what I think is coming, I would only say that I am begrudgingly impressed with the competence of the special counsel&#8217;s office here. It&#8217;s quite a feat to keep that Papadopoulos arrest and plea confidential for the amount of time he did without it leaking.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, he&#8217;s definitely going very methodically. I mean, everything that&#8217;s being done is the way that competent federal prosecutors roll up a case, just accelerated. He&#8217;s going at a much faster than usual pace. He&#8217;s being very aggressive in the things he&#8217;s asking for. So, for instance there was news he had successfully convinced a federal judge to force Manafort&#8217;s prior lawyer to testify before the grand jury on the basis of a finding that he could probably prove that Manafort consulted the lawyer for the purposes of fraud. That&#8217;s huge! It&#8217;s a very aggressive stance for a prosecutor to take and it&#8217;s unusual for a judge to agree to it. And it just shows how willing they are to use all the tools available to them and that the tools available to a federal prosecutor are formidable and all the avenues they are willing to go. My expectation is that we&#8217;re still going to see things dominated by sort of the throw off from the investigation rather than the investigation itself. In other words, we&#8217;re going to continue to see people getting tagged, not for something underlying they did that was against the law, but for something they did in reaction to the investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, I mean the cliché statement, you know, that the cover up is worse than the crime may be literally true here in terms of the consequences that people pay in their attempts to cover up activity that may not have even been illegal, but would have been wildly unpopular in the United States, because it showed that they were essentially working with foreign powers to try to influence a domestic presidential election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s a cliché because it&#8217;s perfectly true. It&#8217;s the primary way I would say that high-profile people get taken down by the feds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> Remember that Mueller&#8217;s mandate is not just find whether there was a crime and you know prosecute it if there were, which might raise eyebrows about these, sort of, tangential crimes that then spin off that would not have happened but for the investigation. He&#8217;s also conducting an intelligence investigation to find out what happened, whether, or not, there was a crime. It&#8217;s sort of a counterespionage activity as much as it is a criminal prosecution and so he&#8217;s using these tools of perjury and lying to federal investigators and so forth in unrelated financial crimes that come to light because he&#8217;s scrutinizing these people so carefully, not just as an end to itself, but to try to get at the essence of what happened in 2016 and to what extent was that election tilted by a foreign power, which is something worth knowing, whether or not you can say it fits neatly within a standard federal criminal statute.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> General Michael Flynn, who, you know, we haven&#8217;t been hearing much about him lately. There&#8217;s questions swirling around whether he is cooperating already, whether there&#8217;s some kind of a sealed indictment against him, or if that&#8217;s yet to come. What are you hearing about General Flynn these days, Charlie?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s gone awfully quiet and he was in a lot of hot water over a variety of things related to false statements on forms and his strange interactions with the Turkish government in his case, or that the parallel to a Manafort&#8217;s interactions with the Ukrainian government. People wonder what&#8217;s up with him and whether he&#8217;s cooperating or not and I&#8217;m sure the Trump White House would like to know as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s got to be at a minimum extremely worried after yesterday though because the aggressiveness of the case theory in the Manafort indictment regarding registration as a foreign agent is something that if you moved it over to Flynn, I think would very easily support an indictment on a similar theory. I mean, it&#8217;s pretty clear that Flynn didn&#8217;t register as an agent for Turkey when he should have. He did it belatedly and often that would prevent prosecutors from charging based on it, but a prosecutor this aggressive, as aggressive as reflected in the Manafort indictment? I mean, I could see very easily them going after him, again, on a series of crimes arising out of the theory that he deliberately didn&#8217;t register when he should have.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean it sounds like both of you are saying that one possible scenario here is that a number of people end up getting caught for crimes that they committed that are not necessarily about dealings with the Russian government, but maybe about their lobbying practices, their own financial dealings and that it doesn&#8217;t actually lead to a criminal charge regarding their involvement with Russia, but rather a series of criminal charges having to with a cover up, or other issues that were uncovered by the special prosecutor&#8217;s investigation. Is that accurate?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> Absolutely. And I think the important thing to note is that it&#8217;s not an exception, it&#8217;s the rule. So, you look, you know even as relatively recently as the Ken Starr investigation of then-President Clinton. The main action wound up being something that was completely collateral to what he was originally tasked to investigate. And, again, this is very typical of federal criminal investigations. Often the thing that they wind up getting people on, particularly in politics, particularly high profile people, are spinoffs from the investigation, not the original subject of the investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> A difference between Ken Starr setting out to discover whether there was financial misdeeds in the Whitewater investigation and ending up with a perjury case related to a sexual affair is that there was no real connection between the two of substance at the end. It&#8217;s not like he was pressuring Bill Clinton to come clean about Whitewater. Here, I think you have to understand Mueller&#8217;s strategy as clearly being about putting pressure on Manafort, and maybe Flynn, and others, to tell him what they know about the Russia case, in exchange for leniency on these other apparent crimes he&#8217;s uncovered. There is an end goal to the effort.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Charlie, Ken — thanks so much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> My pleasure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> Thank you for the opportunity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ken White is a criminal defense lawyer and a former federal prosecutor, and his writing can be found at Popehat. Charlie Savage is a New York Times reporter and the author of the books “Takeover” and “Power Wars.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At some point over the past month, we don&#8217;t know the exact day, President Trump signed a secret authorization giving the CIA and the U.S. military, broader latitude to conduct counterterrorism strikes, through drones, raids, other covert operations. Trump gave them more freedom than they were permitted under President Obama. Among the changes is that the CIA and the military will no longer need to go through a high-level vetting of the targets of proposed strikes, or to find that the individuals that the United States wants to kill actually pose a specific threat to Americans. Instead, Trump&#8217;s order authorizes a &#8220;persistent campaign of direct action&#8221; — that&#8217;s a euphemism for killing people either through raids or strikes — in a variety of countries against any suspected member of a group deemed as a terror organization by the authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, that was passed by Congress in the days following 9/11 in 2001.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Charlie Savage, who we just talked to, of the New York Times, broke that story as well and I asked him to lay out its significance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> So, the new rules keep the basic notion that there&#8217;s going to be a different set of standards for a conventional battlefield like Afghanistan or Iraq. And a, sort of other place, like a Somalia, Yemen, Libya — sort of a chaotic anarchic zone where there&#8217;s not just an ordinary war happening on a day to day basis. But they eliminate that need for a high-level individualized vetting and they eliminate the need for the target to pose a threat as an individual to Americans specifically. The way the system is going to work now is that the national security staff will come up with a plan for a particular country that would involve an ability to carry out a sustained campaign of offensive drone strikes or raids and that if approved, then there doesn&#8217;t need to be a case by case analysis, they can just go forward until the plan expires in 12 months.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the permitted targets of those kinds of strikes can be any member of a group the government has decided is covered by the 9/11 war authorization, just ordinary foot soldiers if they want. Not just high level individual leaders. They kept, however, the standard that there had to be near-certainty that no civilians would be killed, which is not a rule that exists on conventional battlefields.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A definite theme of this Administration&#8217;s first year on these matters has been to devolve more authority to the operators, whether they be in the Pentagon or the CIA, to get rid of what they saw as bureaucracy and micromanaging by the White House in the Obama years, which the DOD and the CIA didn&#8217;t like, thought was sclerotic, and got in the way of them doing what they thought they needed to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s a risk to them though that also comes with this because a piece of this — to the extent that the White House hasn&#8217;t signed off or didn&#8217;t have specific knowledge of this particular strike or that particular operation before it happened, if something goes wrong, and periodically things of course always go wrong, they&#8217;re going to be left out to dry. There was a bad raid in Yemen in late January shortly after Trump took office that he had signed off on in which a SEAL was killed and a bunch of civilians were killed and a $75 million dollar aircraft was destroyed. And Trump didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;buck stops with me, I signed off on it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Uh, the generals wanted to do that.&#8221; And after these four American army troops were killed in an ambush in Niger earlier in October, Trump said, &#8220;Well, you know, the generals decided to put those people there.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I have generals that are great generals, these are great fighters, these are warriors, and I gave them authority to do what&#8217;s right so that we win. I want to win.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CS:\u003c/strong> So, you can see that the blame avoidance is going to be at once give more leash but also not take the hit to Pentagon leaders or intelligence agency leaders when bad things occasionally happen as a result of, in particular, this broader latitude they&#8217;ve been given.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Trump Administration&#8217;s position similar to that of President Obama&#8217;s is that the 2001 AUMF is all that&#8217;s really needed to conduct multiple wars in strikes across the globe. And there&#8217;s been momentum building in Congress, under both Obama and certainly now under Trump, to revisit and to re-implement a sort of updated version of that authorization. And some in Congress want to place limits on how long it would be valid for and where it could be used. Both Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Senate this week that they would oppose any such limits from the Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sec. of State Rex Tillerson:\u003c/strong> A new AUMF must not be geographically restricted. As is the case under the current AUMF, the administration would need to retain the statutory authority to use military force against an enemy that does not respect or limit itself based on geographic boundaries.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: This whole debate about the authorization for the use of military force comes as a bipartisan coalition on Capitol Hill is trying to pass legislation that would cut off U.S. military aid and weapons sales to Saudi Arabia for its genocidal war in Yemen. It also takes place as Congress members and the media are asking questions about why the U.S. has 800 military troops deployed to the African nation of Niger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, on October 4th, four U.S. Special Forces soldiers were ambushed and killed in Niger and much of the media coverage and reaction on Capitol Hill to the Niger deaths has implied that it&#8217;s a mystery why the U.S. has troops in Niger and that this somehow is a new development under Trump, which of course it is not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In fact, President Obama greatly expanded U.S. counterterrorism and drone operations throughout the African continent. So much of how U.S. counterterrorism policy is covered in the U.S. media is linked to when things go wrong, and soldiers or diplomats are killed, or when an act of terrorism hits. Like the recent hotel bombing in Somalia reportedly carried out by the militant group al Shabaab that killed more than 300 people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, today we&#8217;re going to take a comprehensive look at U.S. militarism and counterterrorism in Africa. And also the role that the forces of U.S. allies in Africa play in their own countries, as well as so-called peacekeepers from the military coalition known as AMISOM.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;m joined now by two people. Nick Turse is an investigative journalist specializing in Africa, particularly the growing presence of U.S. drone bases and special operations activity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nick is a contributing writer at The Intercept and he&#8217;s the author of several really important books, including, &#8220;Next Time They&#8217;ll Count the Dead.&#8221; And, &#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s Battlefield: U.S. Proxy Wars and Secret Ops in Africa.&#8221; And I&#8217;m joined by Samar Al-Bulushi. She&#8217;s a security researcher who has spent extensive time on the ground in Kenya investigating the role of U.S. and Kenyan counterterrorism operations. Samar is currently a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California at Irvine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nick Turse, Samar Al-Bulushi, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nick Turse:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Samar Al-Bulushi:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Nick let&#8217;s start with you. When I first saw the news come out about these US troops being killed in Niger, I wasn&#8217;t surprised and part of the reason why I wasn&#8217;t surprised is because I&#8217;ve been following your work for years. I want to dig deep into the broader role that US military forces and the CIA drones, et cetera have played in Africa. But let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s begin with Niger as an example. When did we get to a point where, in the modern context, where the U.S. didn&#8217;t just have like a handful of military advisers working out of its embassy or attached to some other counterterrorism forces. But actually when did we start to see larger numbers of U.S. troops on the ground in Niger?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> This really dates to 2013 when President Obama dispatched about 100 U.S. forces to conduct what they call ISR, intelligence surveillance reconnaissance operations in Niger. So basically flying drones to give over watch over Niger and other neighboring countries in West Africa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What specific groups were they targeting when Obama first deployed these troops?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> Well, at that time we&#8217;re looking al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, these were also used for a Boko Haram who was, at that point, really in Nigeria but beginning to expand out. So those were the two main groups and since then we&#8217;ve seen a splintering and proliferation of other groups in the area.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean there&#8217;s a difference between operating a base where you&#8217;re conducting drone surveillance or drone strikes and actually having your troops out in the field where they can be ambushed and killed as we saw in this hit on October 4th. What do we know about previous or current U.S. counterterrorism operations that are not just drone strikes or supporting drone strikes?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> Just after 9/11, talking around 2002 or so, the United States started dispatching small teams, special operations forces, generally Green Berets to work alongside local forces, all across West Africa under the trans-Sahara counterterrorism partnership. Niger was a key component of this. So, U.S. troops have been coming in and out all throughout that time. Small teams, out in the field, a lot of times working in very remote areas doing desert patrolling, that sort of thing. And with greater numbers of terror groups and militants out there, there&#8217;s always escalating chance of this happening. Now, recently we&#8217;ve heard from the last commander of U.S. special operations forces in Africa, General Donald Bolduc that actually, U.S. troops have been involved in firefights over the last few years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know, that could have happened it almost any time it seems within the last few years. It just happened in October where we had fatalities from it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Samar Al-Bulushi, you have been doing research into Kenya&#8217;s role in the broader so-called war on terrorism. Kenya, of course, has been a key U.S. staging ground for operations in Somalia but also elsewhere throughout East Africa and, at times, West Africa. You spent the better part of the past five years either on the ground in Kenya investigating this or researching it from elsewhere. I wanted to start by asking you about the way that we talk about the wars that the United States is increasingly involved in Africa and sort of the term &#8220;shadow war.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What&#8217;s your read on how we even talk about what the United States is doing on a counterterrorism level in Africa?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> It may be true that the U.S. military has been operating in the shadows from the perspective of the average American, but for many Africans there&#8217;s no hiding the brutal every-day reality of counterterrorism policies that are sanctioned and often funded by the U.S. government. So, although, people may not necessarily be talking about AFRICOM or the U.S., they&#8217;re actually talking about their own police and militaries because this is who they see on the ground.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AFRICOM Promo:\u003c/strong> Deterring and defeating transnational threats, preventing future conflicts, supporting humanitarian disaster relief efforts, and protecting U.S. security interests: That&#8217;s the mission of U.S. Africa Command. But it&#8217;s a mission we can&#8217;t do alone. Working with our African, US, and international partners, AFRICOM is moving forward. Together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> In the past few years what we&#8217;ve seen is the African continent has seen the largest relative rise in military spending of any region in the world, amounting to over $50 billion, it&#8217;s roughly corresponded to about an 81 percent cumulative increase in spending. So, what we&#8217;re witnessing is a growing investment in war across the region and of course this is, it&#8217;s no coincidence that this coincides with the emergence of AFRICOM.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If we take Kenya as an example, in fiscal year 2016, military spending in Kenya rose to a new high of $933 million, and this is a figure that stands at more than double the military spending of Ethiopia and Uganda combined for 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, as we know each of these governments have deployed troops to Somalia, so it&#8217;s logical to make the connection between these troops deployments and the higher spending. But there tends to be less consideration of what impact the spending has for the populations back home on the streets of Nairobi and Kampala for example.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, if we take, you may recall in April 2014, the Kenyan government launched what they called Operation Sanitize Eastleigh, when more than 6,000 members of the security apparatus were deployed to city streets and rounded up over 1,000 people in a sports stadium in Nairobi.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet, even this operation I think is in many ways just a spectacular form of what&#8217;s going on in an everyday basis in a place like Kenya.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I was on the ground in Somalia investigating the kind of expanding operations that the U.S. was engaged in during the presidency of Barack Obama. And it seemed to me as though when Obama was president you had this attempt to even further Africanize U.S. counterterrorism operations using other countries&#8217; forces. And so, Obama would say, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re no longer doing these extraordinary renditions.&#8221; But they would have the Kenyan government, for instance, snatch someone and then fly them to Somalia where they would be interrogated by quote-unquote Somalis and you&#8217;d have like U.S. personnel just kind of getting debriefed on it. That was the way it was portrayed. Is that an accurate portrayal of what happened under Obama?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Yes, I would agree with that, but I would take it one step further if we&#8217;re to return to this this idea of shadows. Right? Because what you just described still makes reference to the idea of a prison that&#8217;s kind of tucked away out of view from Americans, out of view from the rest of the world, when in fact what&#8217;s also happening is people who are being swept off the streets in broad daylight, and either killed outright, or held in regular prisons across the continent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I mentioned regular presence, you know, we can take the Kampala 2010 bombings and the suspects who were rounded up then, and who since then have been held in one of Uganda’s maximum security prisons. So, it&#8217;s significant here — is that U.S.- sanctioned bad things don&#8217;t only happen in secret prisons that are tucked away out of sight, they happen inside supposedly legitimate bodies and institutions as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know one of the things I really appreciate about your work is how you focus on these domestic forces that largely are snatching, and in some cases torturing or extra-judicially handling their own people or immigrants in their own country. But they&#8217;re also financially supported in doing so by the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Exactly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Nick, to turn to the bigger picture of some of the work that you&#8217;ve done, what I think is particularly fascinating is you have not just been kind of taken with the idea of the drone being the story, but rather the policies that these drone strikes are used to support or further, and the role of U.S. boots on the ground. Paint a picture for the expansion of U.S. facilities and operations that you&#8217;ve tracked over the past decade in North, East, and West Africa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> I noticed, you know, the better part of ten years ago that the United States is putting a logistics network in place. When I asked about this at AFRICOM, they told me it was only about humanitarian operations: digging wells, building orphanages, that type of thing. But I could tell that they were putting in something much larger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What you generally see are, you know, smallish outposts generally either on existing military bases for the local forces&#8217; use and then the United States has a compound there or they will take an older airstrip sort of rehab it and become a U.S. base.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I should say that U.S.-Africa Command continues to say as they have from the beginning that they only operate one base on the continent: that is Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, which is an old French Foreign Legion base that they have built up, and up, and up. It&#8217;s become a really sprawling, hardened compound right at Djibouti&#8217;s main international airport.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, in fact, they outgrew that base so much that they had to move their drone operations off to a place called Chabelley Airfield, a satellite base. That base sort of exemplifies what the United States has done. They took an old French airstrip and they just put in first tents, more pavement, so that they could store more drones there, and then have kept building it up, and building it up. It&#8217;s become integral to operations on the continent, also drone operations that are flown to the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, and then used for the Islamic State, the war against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Where do we know of that the U.S. has drone bases or areas that can be used to launch so-called counterterrorism strikes, either by drone or by U.S. forces embedding with local forces. What countries have you been able to document?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> Come in and out of existence, but, over time, you know, the U.S. has had bases in Kenya, several in Somalia, also Chad, Ethiopia, Niger, they had a small facility in Mali for a time. I mentioned Djibouti.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> People get the sense though and you can see a lot of Nick&#8217;s work at theintercept.com and other places where he has obtained documents that show kind of the landscape of this, and I should point out that while Nick has at times reported on documents provided by whistleblowers or confidential sources, a lot of the journalism that Nick Turse does is aggressive freedom of information reporting and scouring the open public record. In fact, it reminds me of how IF Stone, the great journalist conducted himself. He wasn&#8217;t getting information from whistleblowers, he was taking the government&#8217;s own information and putting it into a context so that people could understand what it was their government was doing in their name.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot out there and a lot of it is scattered around through military publications, on various military websites and if you can take the time and search through that, search through contracts, you can start to put together a broad outline of what the United States is doing in Africa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Samar, I want to ask you about this recent horrifying bombing that happened in Mogadishu and then there was there have been a series of, of other really deadly attacks since then. You had 300-plus people were killed in the bombing of the Safari Hotel and we know that under President Donald Trump, there seem to be or at least we&#8217;re aware of more U.S. personnel engaging in on the ground operations. The Somali government, its security forces are sponsored by a series of Western, European, and American government, and other African nations, in addition to the African peacekeeping forces that have been in Somalia now for, for years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What&#8217;s your read on what&#8217;s happening right now in Somalia and the context of this massive bombing that killed so many people that got very little attention when you contrast it with how the lives of white people or Europeans are covered when it&#8217;s an act of terrorism in Germany, or France, or Spain, or the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> I think I&#8217;ll start with that last point, the last question you raised about life, the value of life, because what I noticed in the response to this latest horrific attack in which over 300 were killed was that people across the Internet were using the hashtag #AfricanLivesMatter, #BlackLivesMatter, #StandWithSomalia, to capture the hypocrisy within the international community, right? In terms of the ways in which we make sense of these kinds of tragedies and the levels of attention that are attributed to Somalia versus Europe for example. Now, what struck me there is that in making these appeals to a common humanity, there is a risk that we actually obscure the ways in which African lives are quite different in fact than European lives, than white lives, right? And this is what the argument that&#8217;s been made by Black Lives Matter in the United States, I think the entire movement rests on an understanding of difference and on highlighting difference. And, what, kind of a contradictory move that ends up being made in calling for us to stand with Somalia is that it obscures that difference that obscures the ways in which African life is consistently devalued.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now the second point that&#8217;s interesting is that why is it that we&#8217;re calling for an equal valuation of African life only in the aftermath of terror attacks. And I think the sad reality is that Africans have now realized that it&#8217;s only in the context of a terror attack that the rest of the world actually will pay attention to what&#8217;s going on, when in fact you have structural forms of violence there taking place every day that are taking so many, you know, just as many lives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If we come back to the question of what&#8217;s actually unfolding on the ground, I think another point that was raised on social media is the need for more action on the part of the international community to help crack down on al Shabaab to stabilize Somalia. Now, the question for me is: What has the international community already been doing that in fact has exacerbated the situation rather than help to solve it? And I think the African Union mission in the form of 22,000 troops on the ground for ten years — this has, this is essentially amount to a military occupation. The UN has documented all kinds of abuse by these AMISON forces, the UN has documented the black market sale of arms that end up in the hands of al Shabaab, and people are not prepared to kind of grapple with those contradictions. And I think until we&#8217;re prepared to do that, then we won&#8217;t see an end to the instability in Somalia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And, in fact, in 2006, the Bush Administration openly endorsed an Ethiopian invasion of Somalia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>News reporter:\u003c/strong> Channel Four News has obtained an exclusive document revealing America&#8217;s role in the planning and execution of last month&#8217;s Ethiopian invasion of Somalia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was marked by horrifying war crimes: rape, murder, extrajudicial killings, and it might be unpopular to say it, but I think people who really understood the history of Somalia would agree that what the Bush administration supported in this Ethiopian invasion was overthrowing perhaps the only fragile coalition that could have potentially ended massive killing inside of Somalia. And they did it because they were called the Islamic Courts Union, the fact that Islamic was in the title of their, of their movement, even though they represented people from across Somali society and Somalia is an almost entirely 100 percent Muslim country, that was a no-no. And so, Ethiopia got the support of the United States in conducting this brutal invasion and subsequent occupation that ultimately led to the AMISOM occupation that you&#8217;re now describing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Yeah and I think it&#8217;s important to highlight, you know, the contradictions of the UN and African Union here too, because what you&#8217;re describing was an illegal military invasion both by Ethiopia in 2006, by Kenya in 2011, and in both occasions, not only did the UN fail to condemn these, but they actually sanctioned their continued presence, they essentially legitimized their presence by converting it into a peacekeeping operation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to ask both you this, but I&#8217;ll start with you Nick: Have you seen any tangible shift in U.S. policy in Africa when it comes to military intelligence operations under Donald Trump over these past ten months?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s tough to discern whether there&#8217;s been a real increase, but it at least gives the appearance to me that we&#8217;re seeing, one, a loosening of the bonds of what the U.S. military can do on the ground and I think that commanders on the ground know they have freer rein. They can make more decisions. Now Trump is always trusting in his generals, as he says. I think we&#8217;re seeing that in Africa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: I think one of the stories we&#8217;re going to look back on and realize a lot of people missed is that the military and the CIA are entering a real golden era because of Trump&#8217;s unique combination of not wanting to know all of the facts and deference to anybody with a uniform and shiny medals on their chest. Samar, your analysis of Africa policy under Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> What has been curious to me is to look at the kind of the State Department side of things. In the case of Kenya for example, the current ambassador to Kenya has remained in place in the transition period from Obama to Trump. And, it&#8217;s fascinating because none of the language changes, none of the approach seems to change. So, on the soft power side of things, you have continued huge amounts of money that are pouring in towards so-called countering violent extremism programs and it&#8217;s such that the public sphere now in a place like Kenya and increasingly across the continent has been colonized by this discourse of countering violent extremism and the impact of this is that people who would otherwise be speaking out, mobilizing against military operations, mobilizing against counterinsurgency operations that are unfolding on their streets in which people disappear in broad daylight, the conversation shifts instead to your neighbor, to your family member as a potential problem, rather than thinking about the ways in which the police is being is being militarized and is, it&#8217;s actually the problem, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And connected to that is the forms of capacity building which I know Nick has talked about as well that take place, in which people are encouraged to put their trust in the police and the military, rather than question the ways in which they&#8217;re increasingly — their powers are being expanded.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to ask you more of a historical question. You had this immense spread of colonialism that was brutal and murderous and then you had movements that rose-up to oppose colonialism and to declare independence in a number of African nations. And I&#8217;m wondering your analysis now that we see Western powers increasingly fighting once again over natural resources throughout Africa, deploying not only their own forces but supporting the most brutal internal security and military forces in these countries, has anything really fundamentally changed since colonialism was quote-unquote defeated in many African nations?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Perhaps, you know, this is a good opportunity to highlight the ways in which some of the people who I spent time with in Kenya have tried to call out these forms of neocolonialism that are that are unfolding and more specifically to call out the counterterror abuses that are sanctioned by the United States. Because that is happening, it&#8217;s not as though, again, to come back to the idea of shadows, it&#8217;s not as though all of this is happening behind the scenes without anyone taking notice. People are. And in the aftermath of the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia you had hundreds of people pouring across the border, over 100 people were then disappeared into black sites and it was Kenyan human rights activists who did all of the on-the-ground work to try to find out where these people had gone. And they went literally prison to prison, guard to guard documenting this information.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it&#8217;s just worth noting that there are forms of resistance to U.S. empire in Africa today. But that at the same time, the U.S. then responds to these forms of resistance and this is where the colonization of civil space that I was referring to earlier is significant because on the one hand, it&#8217;s, on a financial basis, it&#8217;s becoming harder for you to survive as an activist today, unless you buy into the lingo that&#8217;s authorized by the U.S. government and, on the other hand, people are actually being told in no uncertain terms that their own lives are in danger if and when they dare decide to question. And some of the people who were apprehended in the aftermath of the Kampala 2010 bombings themselves had been activists, the people who then went to represent them in Kampala were then thrown in jail, they were activists. And, more recently, the human rights groups that I spent time with in Mombasa, on the coast were placed on a list of supposed supporters of al Shabaab, not because that is in fact the case but in fact because they had been the ones to most directly challenge the Kenyan government and the U.S. and U.K. governments for their role in the war on terror.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How many countries in the world right now does U.S. Special Operations Command have deployed?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s somewhere north of 130 countries around the world, about 70 percent of the nations on the planet had a U.S. Special Operations deployment over the last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and for people listening to this show, if you have U.S. special operations forces in 130 countries around the world, you better start looking into what potentially is going to happen in those 130 countries that you only hear about when something goes wrong or when the US wants to brag about some extraordinary victory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> Any one of them could be the next Niger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Does the fact that Trump is in power, does it bring any new layer or different nuance that we need to apply as we analyze the role of the U.S. in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Well, okay, I&#8217;ll speak to the African continent, because what I&#8217;ve noticed and I don&#8217;t know if Nick has seen this as well, is that there&#8217;s a surprising degree of interest/support for Trump in Africa. I think there&#8217;s kind of an intrigue in this figure. And that should tell us something about the publics in Africa and the ways in which they understand power and checks on power or lack thereof.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The thing that&#8217;s been striking to me in the Kenyan case is not that people have been speaking out directly against the War on Terror, but in fact the opposite. If we take the general public, right, there seems to be support for Kenyan military operations in Somalia. And that&#8217;s one of the things that I&#8217;ve been trying to unpack is how and why that&#8217;s the case and how it is that people are socialized to support militarism. Right? Well and I would imagine part of it is the same reason why you see this sort of overt xenophobia in the United States and that being flamed by those in power, i.e. Trump because you want to put people in position where they&#8217;re kind of punching down or are afraid of the other, and in Kenya where you have a growing population of Somalis, you have a growing population of Muslims in Kenya, the Kenyan authorities have done their best to sort of say “well they&#8217;re the real, the real Kenyans should be very afraid of the outsiders and we need to kill them all.” I mean, I see in the coverage of Kenya and in the Kenyan media a very similar pattern to what we see with Trump and his Muslim ban and his talk about the Mexico border.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NT:\u003c/strong> Well, I was just going to say that when I was in South Sudan earlier this year, there were a lot of people that were cautiously optimistic about Trump. And then, you know, a few times I heard tongue in cheek, you know, &#8220;You finally have an African strongman in the White House, and now you know what it&#8217;s like.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> All right we&#8217;re going to leave it there.

Roberto Lange is the mastermind behind the one man musical project Helado Negro. His fifth LP, Private Energy was just re-released this year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Though the songs were written in 2014, tracks such as &#8220;Young, Latin, and Proud&#8221; and, &#8220;It&#8217;s my Brown Skin,&#8221; took on a life of their own during Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign and they were embraced as anthemic declarations of pride and self-love. Our producer Jack D&#8217;Isidoro adoring spoke to Roberto about his music, growing up in south Florida and young people staying hopeful in the Trump era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Roberto Lange: \u003c/strong>I&#8217;m Roberto Lange, also known as Helado Negro. My parents were both born in Ecuador, they moved to New York, and then I was born in Florida. They moved to Florida, they honeymooned and stayed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think they surrounded themselves immediately with people from Ecuador first. So that was like what was in the household, it was like our house was mostly people that were just either Ecuadorian or from Latin American countries and that&#8217;s not hard in Miami.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, no one played instruments in the family, but my parents would have a lot of parties or there would be a lot of parties. There would be like tons of musicians that would be playing and so they would be at our house, they would cover and sing a lot of Latin pop jams from like the 60s and 70s and I would do the same, I would just sing some of those jams like via a karaoke machine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the people we would, I would cover at least was Leo Dan, and Leo Dan had a song called &#8220;Celia.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Celia&#8221; by Leo Dan plays]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> And I remember singing it and I remember my mom brought me back one of these little like, tablature for a guitar books, and it had like all these Leo Dan songs, all these Raphael songs, all these like Roberto Carlo songs, like all these people who are like pop artists in Latin America. And I would just learn them and then sing them. Like in 2010, I made a little covers EP of just the songs I would jam when I was little.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> At the time in Miami, I would say it was really unique in the 80s and 90s because on the radio there was like a lot of Miami bass. And on the radio at night there was like a lot of like Italo disco and a kind of like a very specific scene, because I think it was such a party-oriented kind of culture on the beach. So there was always all this kind of fun music that was always like different.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J Trump:\u003c/strong> When Mexico sends its people, they&#8217;re not sending their best, they&#8217;re not sending you, they&#8217;re not sending you. They&#8217;re sending people that have lots of problems and they&#8217;re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> So, when Young, Latin, and Proud&#8221; came out, it was in 2015, it wasn&#8217;t this premeditated thing. Donald Trump hadn&#8217;t spoken about Mexicans being rapists, criminals, and so we had already decided when we were going to release this song. And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh we&#8217;re going to release it, blah, blah, blah, whichever day, and then that happened.&#8221; And then the song was released.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Young, Latin, and Proud&#8221; by Helado Negro]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> &#8220;Young, Latin, and Proud&#8221; ended up being something that people took for themselves, like younger latinx people who were feeling the specific feeling. It&#8217;s amazing in the fact that people have been able to find a way to use a song as a tool of empowerment. That is more exciting to me than anyone else who&#8217;s tried to like corral people into the specific thing with it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What&#8217;s happening more so now the president Trump is our president — it&#8217;s the same as it ever was, and I think the only thing that&#8217;s different now is that more white people are offended. And I think that&#8217;s the only difference. You know, people of color have always been affected by all of these things all the time. And I think more people are like, &#8220;Oh man, this is crazy! This is like not how I feel.&#8221; That&#8217;s great.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I see people using the word ally a lot and I think the word ally is pretty snooze-y. I feel like it&#8217;s kind of like giving people an out. I like to build like accomplices, people who are kind of like in it and they know that when they&#8217;re in it, they&#8217;re just as accountable as you are. You know, I feel like an ally somebody is like, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re here, we&#8217;re over here, we&#8217;re kind of on the other side of this fence,&#8221; where, an accomplice is like, they&#8217;re kind of sewn onto you, you know? And we&#8217;re kind of rolling around together.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I feel like that&#8217;s always been my interest, is like people who are kind of like another part of you and you&#8217;re part of them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;It&#8217;s My Brown Skin,&#8221; by Roberto Lange]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> The song it&#8217;s my brown skin ends up being internal and external, in a really fluid way where you&#8217;re kind of talking to yourself, this organism the biggest organ on your body. Like, how it&#8217;s the one thing that&#8217;s representative of you, you know it&#8217;s like if you had your heart outside your body, people would maybe divide each other by the shapes and colors of your heart, you know? So, it&#8217;s really weird in that respect that that&#8217;s always been this kind of line of demarcation where our mind is like, &#8220;Well, stay away,&#8221; or &#8220;Come towards me.&#8221; And so, it&#8217;s really just this whole like love theme of just like just being in love with yourself and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s nice. That&#8217;s just saying, like, look at yourself. It&#8217;s all good.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;It&#8217;s My Brown Skin,&#8221; by Roberto Lange]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s a part of the lyric that says, &#8220;There&#8217;s friends of different shades, different ways, who feel the same way, don&#8217;t ever forget them.&#8221; In that moment there was a lot of Syrian refugees trying to get over to the United States, trying to get over to different parts of Europe, just trying to get the hell out, you know? And I feel like a lot of the Muslim community was affected by this general stance of just being over generalized, you know, as like, &#8220;Well you&#8217;re all terrible people, because if you&#8217;re brown and you&#8217;re Muslim then you&#8217;re — you&#8217;ve got to be bad.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;It&#8217;s My Brown Skin,&#8221; by Roberto Lange]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RL:\u003c/strong> A message for somebody who&#8217;s out there who&#8217;s feeling like it&#8217;s — it doesn&#8217;t make sense or that there&#8217;s no hope. For sure, one thing I think a goal is freedom and freedom means that you can do what you want, and if you think about that first and foremost, how you can get to that point in your life, I think that&#8217;s how you want to strive to be, you want to be free doing the things that you want to do. And none of these people will live longer than you. All these older people who are definitely going to get older. As time passes things change so much that in four years things change, in five years, and ten years. And that&#8217;s my experience is how much things change over time and the people that are around you start to change their perspectives. So, time is always on your side especially if you&#8217;re younger than most people, I think and so I think freedom is attainable for you to feel and be who you want to be, knowing that you have the time to do all these things right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Roberto Lange is best known as Helado Negro.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that does it for this week&#8217;s show.

This week on Intercepted: Trump doubles down on his support for the ruling faction in the House of Saud as its genocidal war in Yemen rages on and its public listing of oil company Saudi Aramco could be worth $2 trillion. Rep. Ro Khanna tells us that he is now calling for a complete end to all U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia. He also discusses the horrendous catastrophe in Yemen, charges of Russian interference in the U.S. election, and the state of the Democratic Party. The former chief prosecutor at Guantánamo Bay prison blasts Trump over his repeated interference in the case of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and the recent terror attack in New York. Col. Morris Davis fought the Bush administration, was fired under Obama, and now shares his views of the history and presidents of the past 17 years. As the Paradise Papers rock the world of the rich and the elite who use off shore banks and law firms, we get analysis from Nomi Prins, a former managing director of Goldman Sachs. Prins also lays out the bottom line on the GOP tax plan. And Jeremy offers a commentary on the value of “whataboutism.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tucker Carlson:\u003c/strong> Ivanka Trump cut out of her father&#8217;s Asia trip early to come back and make the case for the Republican Party&#8217;s tax reform plan.

I said RSVP because it was a sit-down dinner. But people came to that like did not RSVP, so I was like totally buggin’.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings.

Do they have any semblance of guilt?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we get started with the program today, I want to address a line of argument that has become pervasive in today’s politics and it centers around this concept known as whataboutism. I am not talking about the terrible idiotic manner that Trump justifies neo-Nazis, mass-shootings —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We have a lot of mental health problems in our country as do other countries, but this isn’t a guns situation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> — even the murderous history of Vladimir Putin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Will I get along with him? I have no idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill O’Reilly:\u003c/strong> But he’s a killer though. Putin’s a killer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What? You think our country is so innocent?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> By the way, in this case, what Trump said about Putin and other world leaders? He’s right. But in general, Trump’s whataboutisms are more crass — a blunt attempt to literally change the subject. What Trump regularly does is basically just asking people to ignore whatever negative attention he is rightly being given, and instead focus on someone else’s controversies, both real and imagined. He is certainly doing that in responding to Robert Mueller’s investigation into his campaign by openly saying that “the FBI should really be investigating Hillary Clinton.” He’s not saying “Yeah investigate me and potential connections of my campaign staff to Russia and also investigate Hillary Clinton and the DNC and the Clinton Global Foundation. He is saying “don’t waste any time investigating me and this Russia stuff. Instead go after Hillary Clinton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So that’s not what I want to actually talk about today. What I want to talk about is something different. It is how this allegation of whataboutism is used consistently these days by opponents of Donald Trump, particularly partisan Democrats, in an effort to shut down discussion of U.S. misdeeds or crimes throughout history or about the policies of President Obama, or Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State, and the Democrats writ large. Whataboutism is being portrayed as an old Soviet tactic and anyone caught using it is a suspected Bolshevik agent in today’s media climate. No doubt that the Soviets did in fact use this tactic, but so too has the U.S. Over and over and over. In fact, it is present in every war that the U.S. is involved with. Yes, we kill civilians, but we don’t mean to. We’re not like Russia in Chechnya. Yes, we invade countries and kill innocent people but what about the crimes of their leaders of those countries? Remember when Bush’s WMD argument fell apart?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GWB:\u003c/strong> The main reason we went into Iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction, turns out he didn’t but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction — But I also talked about the human suffering in Iraq. And I also talked about the need to advance the freedom agenda. And so, my answer to your question is that imagine a world in which Saddam Hussein was there stirring up even more trouble in a part of the world that —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He then shifted to, well, Saddam was a tyrant so it was good we overthrew him. Same with Qaddafi in Libya. And on and on and on. So, no, this is not simply a Soviet tactic and smearing people with that charge is disgraceful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, for those of you who are lucky enough not to have been in a political argument recently, here is an example of what I am talking about: The Democrats allege that Donald Trump conspired with Russia and that the Russians used hacking in an effort to sway the U.S. elections in Trump’s favor. In response to this, I say, “Well yeah, I want all of that investigated and exposed. And I want anyone who was engaged in criminal conduct to be held responsible.” OK. Everything’s fine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But then I also point out that the US often finances and supports so-called opposition politicians around the world, including those battling against Russian-preferred candidates, and that the U.S. also has a very long history of interfering in other countries’ elections, including overthrowing popularly elected governments, assassinating foreign leaders. That is where I cross the line. I can now be dismissed as engaging in whataboutism. End of discussion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are a lot of problems with this dynamic. First of all, I want the allegations about Russia and the Trump campaign investigated thoroughly. But just because I cite US history and the global context does not mean that I am excusing the actions of the Russian government. The point is to understand the context. The allegations about Russian interference are often presented today as though Russia invented electoral interference and launched its beta version with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. That’s just false and it does a disservice to all of us, as a purportedly Democratic society, to act as though this is not how governments across the world do business, including the U.S. government. All the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you look at this current scandal or investigation through the lens of the historical and geopolitical context, taking into account recent events with the US and Russian governments, and the proxy wars in places like Georgia and Ukraine, then Russia doesn’t appear as some outlier with its election interference. Instead, it rightly appears as what it is — a powerful nation wrongly interfering in the elections of its adversaries as part of a geopolitical war, just as the U.S. does. It is actually quite relevant to understanding why this will continue to happen in the U.S. and around the world over and over and over. As it has for many decades and in some cases, centuries. And here is perhaps the most important aspect of all of this: We have no credibility to condemn nations that seek to influence our elections or our affairs because we do it constantly on a global scale. We have no moral high ground. Yes, we should try to stop it, as other nations should do when we are the culprits. But facts are facts and not a KGB plot.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This smearing as an agent of whataboutism is constantly deployed these days when you try to point out that the Democrats either legislated or gave support to a whole range of policies that are in fact anti-democratic or racist or war mongering. That Trump did not appear out of a vacuum. Don’t mention Obama and drone strikes. Don’t mention Democrats and regime change. Don’t mention Obama’s sweeping terror watch-list. That’s whataboutism and, according to its critics, it is somehow helping Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Consider this: Is it wrong to point out the hypocrisy of televangelists and right-wing fire and brimstone preachers or republican politicians who rail against women and gay people but secretly have sex with men, or cheat on their wives, or do drugs? Of course not. It is right to point out their utter hypocrisy of these people because it is relevant to their stated principles. The same is true in the foreign affairs of the U.S. government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Also, this dismissive label of whataboutism: it’s not new. In fact, the famed arch conservative William F Buckley had a particular passion for using the charge of false moral equivalency to absolve the U.S. of all sorts of crimes. during the cold war. Buckley famously said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“To say that the CIA and the KGB engage in similar practices is the equivalent of saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus: on the grounds that, after all, in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around.” Those are the words of William F Buckley.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Buckley’s apologetics for the CIA are well known and his point is based entirely on fiction. The CIA during the Cold War was assassinating people, overthrowing governments, spying domestically against U.S. citizens, running death squads, and illegal secret wars, and on, and on. I don’t know who was worse, the CIA or the KGB, but does anyone really believe that one was pure and the other evil incarnate? Come on. When it boils down to it, they were both legitimized assassination squads wrapped in the flags of their respective empires. And this has been the American argument for decades. America is the exception and is never like its enemies even when it gratuitously kills civilians, or invades countries. or tortures people, or drops atomic bombs or supports dictators. It is always with the best of intentions, “in the name of humanity” and therefore, somehow OK. That was Barack Obama’s argument as much as it was Dick Cheney’s. And today you can find it on MSNBC and from a host of liberal news organizations when discussing Trump and the 2016 elections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chuck Todd:\u003c/strong> The idea of doing something because it’s the morally the right thing to do, but there really is no — other than good will, or in that area, or there’s no tangible gain for the United States or for the Western world — what does that mean? That means never intervening in a humanitarian crisis?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Masha Gessen:\u003c/strong> Right unless we can take the oil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Washington Post recently ran a story saying that whataboutism calling it a Soviet tactic from the Cold War that was thawed out by Putin and is now being used by Trump. Literally everything has to connect to Russia. It is really insane.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other aspect of this is this idea that somehow George W Bush is all of a sudden a great friend of the #Resistance because he didn’t vote for Trump and has said a few critical things about Trump. Let’s be clear here: George W Bush presided over wars that killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people. They ran a global torture program. They said the Geneva conventions were quaint. They warehoused people at Guantanamo. But point this out online in response to someone praising George W Bush for not voting for trump and you are bound to get immediate pushback from someone saying “Hey, Trump is unprecedented, we need all hands on deck and we have to be able to see the utility of alliances even with people like Bush. It’s necessary to defeat this unprecedented threat posed by Trump.” Somehow David From and Bill Kristol and George Bush: they’re our friends. I reject that completely. You cannot erase the murderous past of George W Bush and his allies and act like all that matters is opposing Trump. Without a whataboutism in that conversation, it is a vapid, bankrupt embrace of a man who destroyed literally countless lives across this planet. I wouldn’t embrace Charles Manson as my ally if he published an op-ed calling for Trump’s impeachment. No thanks. The leader of the Democrats in the House, Nancy Pelosi, has said she prays that George W Bush was still president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nancy Pelosi:\u003c/strong> So sorry president Bush, I never thought I’d pray for the day that you were president again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Chuck Schumer said Bush’s response to 9/11 was worthy of praise. And Keith Olbermann, he’s one of the leading #Resistance generals, he actually went on TV, on the View, and apologized to Bush!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Keith Olbermann:\u003c/strong> Probably owe George W Bush an apology and I would happily take a third term of George W Bush rather than this —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> History matters. Context matters. Part of why the U.S. war machine keeps going unchecked at Mach speed is because of the mythology that has been aggressively promoted by Democrats and Republicans alike and that every child in this country is taught from the time they start going to school. That’s why we got the PATRIOT Act, that is how we got the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force — that gave a blank check for global, borderless, unaccountable war — that is how we got the Iraq war. It was all bipartisan and done in the name of protecting our security and protecting our exceptionalism. That is why the US has constantly blocked the establishment of an International Criminal Court that would have jurisdiction over all nations, including the United States, when its forces commit war crimes. But Our lives are worth more, our crimes matter not at all. It all boils down to this demonstrably false notion of American exceptionalism. Donald Trump is a horrid president and has shown fascist and authoritarian intent in both his words and policy ideas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But let’s not pretend that he is some alien who landed here speaking a different language. Mostly Donald Trump’s crimes consist of saying things out loud that a lot of right wingers prefer to be whispered in private. Or of trying to impose destructive policies by fiat that a lot of Republicans want but can’t exactly get through Congress. And Trump definitely acts as an oligarch and he certainly has aspects of his presidency that are unique just to him. But Trump has not yet killed anywhere close to the number of innocent people that Bush and Cheney killed. Now he may well surpass them, but he has a long way to go. Obama maintained a secret kill list and asserted the right to kill American citizens who had not even been charged with a crime. That is the epitome of acting like a king or an emperor. Trump is continuing a program Obama put on steroids for him. So, let’s stop with this revisionism. And I am perfectly fine with whatabouting anyone who tries to tell me that Bush is our ally. The correct answer is “what about all of the people he killed? What about the damage he did to our civil liberties and security? What about your own conscience getting into league with someone viewed by many across the globe as a war criminal?” Yeah, I’m guilty of whataboutism because facts matter, context matters. The truth matters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If we, as a society, were actually honest about what happens in our wars, about who actually gets killed, how often we do the very things — albeit in our own American way — as those we condemn as despots or tyrants or terrorists, then the whole dialogue would change. We might actually learn from our own history. The same is true about the Democrats and their role in all of this. We should be talking about it all. So, let’s stop this bullshit of dismissing history and context from everything. Let’s have an honest conversation about the real policies and the real history of this country. Let’s talk about the wars, election interference, the way the U.S. economy functions — our health care, our schools, our housing, our guns, our prisons. From now on, when someone accuses you of engaging in whataboutism, just imagine that what they’re really saying is, “Shut up, I don’t want to hear inconvenient facts.” Imagine that is what they are saying because that is what they are really saying. And then decide how to respond.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alright, on with the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There is an intense situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia right now as Donald Trump continues his Asian tour. The Saudi crown prince, 32-year-old, Mohammed bin Salman, has led a campaign that&#8217;s ongoing to arrest, it appears, any potential rivals to his authority. At least 11 other princes and 38 other people have been arrested in recent days. And they are being held at a luxury hotel that recently had an image of Donald Trump projected onto it. That&#8217;s now become this makeshift five-star prison.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These arrests were all conducted by the Crown Prince&#8217;s anti-corruption force, the MBSs, but there&#8217;s little doubt about it that this is not actually about corruption. It&#8217;s about consolidating power and taking out potential enemies. It&#8217;s not just the five-star prison, but also the mysterious death in a helicopter crash of another prince.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For his part, Donald Trump has doubled down on supporting the House of Saud, saying they know what they&#8217;re doing. One of the princes currently in this hotel prison was a prominent critic of Donald Trump and a man who Trump, in 2015, called, &#8220;a dopey Prince trying to use Daddy&#8217;s money to control U.S. politicians.&#8221; Well, that guy is now out of your hair for the time being, president Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump also has been lobbying the Saudis to list Aramco Oil Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange. It could result in the largest IPO in history, with estimates that the company could be valued at two trillion, with a T, dollars. Trump has also increased U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia, he&#8217;s boasted about all the great weapons he is giving them. Saudi Arabia was the first country that Trump visited as president, remember that weird glowing orb incident?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But literally just months before that visit, and his chummy Lollapalooza of despots and kings, Trump was blaming the Saudis for 9/11:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Donald J. Trump:\u003c/strong> It wasn&#8217;t the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center, we went after Iraq, we decimated the country, Iran&#8217;s taking over, okay — but it wasn&#8217;t the Iraqis. You will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center, because they have papers that there that are very secret. You may find out it&#8217;s the Saudis, okay? But you will find out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And threatening to stop buying their oil. Now we see this total 180-turn from Trump, and he loves the Saudis and he trusts them, and he wants you to trust them, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There&#8217;s a whole debate right now in Saudi Arabia about modernization and issues like granting women the right to drive, and all of that is associated with this same young crown prince. But on the foreign policy side, this particular camp of powerful Saudis, they are the war-crime camp. They are the ones waging what can only be called a genocidal war in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Juan Gonzalez:\u003c/strong> The number of cholera cases in that country has now topped 368,000, with 1,828 deaths. The World Health Organization estimates some 5,000 Yemenis are falling sick each day and Oxfam projects the number of suspected cases of cholera could rise to more than 600,000, making the epidemic, &#8220;the largest ever recorded in any country in a single year.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that war has been aided and abetted by the U.S. and British governments. The Saudis have been a sort of sacred cow in U.S. politics, not unlike support for Israel. Democrats and Republicans have long bought into this notion that Saudi Arabia is a necessary ally in the war on terror. The great balancer against Iranian influence in the region, a key player in the fight against al Qaeda, but let&#8217;s be clear: if the Saudis were just producing a lot of olive oil instead of actual oil, they wouldn&#8217;t be important. They certainly wouldn&#8217;t be that important. Trump would not have visited Saudi Arabia first. Bush would not have held hands with Saudi officials, one of whom was actually nicknamed “Bandar Bush” because of how close he was to the Bush family. (And, as an aside, I&#8217;ve long said that I would not be shocked if we wake up one day to discover that there has been a coup or a revolution breaking out in Saudi Arabia. The place is locked down and ultra-secretive. Large parts of Saudi Arabia are like Albania under Enver Hoxha — nothing in, nothing out.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the midst of all of this and the ongoing Saudi carpet bombing of Yemen, a first-term U.S. Congress member has been spearheading an effort on Capitol Hill to ban any weapon sales or military support for Saudi Arabia that is going to be used in Yemen. That congressman is California Democrat Ro Khanna. And in an Intercepted exclusive, representative Khanna tells me that he is now calling for an end to all military assistance to Saudi Arabia. Period.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I began by asking him to lay out his case against U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ro Khanna:\u003c/strong> Well it starts with recognizing that the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world right now is in Yemen. Almost a million people are suffering from cholera. Almost seven million may be exposed to the risk of famine. The largest port has been blocked by the Saudis and they&#8217;re not letting food and medicine to people who need them. So, it should stir the moral conscience of the world, and almost every person I&#8217;ve talked to in my district, or ordinary Americans when they find out about the crisis, want something done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And one of the things the United States should do is stop refueling Saudi planes or assisting the Saudis with bombing the Yemeni civilians or strangle holding the port that&#8217;s preventing medicine and food from going there. So we should not in any way be aiding the Saudi efforts at bombing civilians there and we should work towards a political solution. And that&#8217;s really what our resolution does — it says we have no authorization of being involved in Yemen&#8217;s civil war and we should not be providing aid to the Saudis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on the ground in Yemen and did a lot of reporting on various strikes under President Barack Obama, and so I wanted to ask you about this narrowing language in your resolution, saying you want to just target the strikes against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. When President Obama initiated this air war, both through drones and cruise missile attacks and also supporting the Saudis, it began in December of 2009, and there were several incidents where large numbers of civilians were killed during operations authorized by President Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Are you concerned that, as you try to limit this to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, that it&#8217;s also going to leave the door open for more civilian deaths in the name of fighting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Right now, we are engaged in activities that has no authorization of force by Congress. So, you can make an argument that the 2001 authorization of force allows the United States to engage in counterterrorism operations. Right now, we&#8217;re engaged in helping the Saudis in their fight against the Houthis, which clearly doesn&#8217;t fall within the 2001 authorization.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Second point is my understanding of the situation is it&#8217;s really the Saudi campaign against the Houthis that has led to a large part of the civilian casualties and that the Saudis are not nearly as careful in their standards as we are in trying to take into account civilians, and making sure that we don&#8217;t have a civilian loss of life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If the question is: &#8220;Do we as a nation need to do even more to make sure when we are engaged in counterterrorism operations around the world and engaged in drone strikes that we are sensitive to civilian casualties and really sensitive to not perpetuating cycles of violence?&#8221; Absolutely we do. And that&#8217;s a broader debate. But right now, this resolution is focused on making sure we don&#8217;t engage even further in Yemen and increase civilian casualties by aiding Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Have you asked Secretary Mattis or other U.S. military or diplomatic officials about this U.S. campaign of supporting what is ultimately a Saudi destruction of Yemen?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> I have and they have acknowledged that we have, in the past, engaged in refueling. We had a huge breakthrough in the House where the military briefed the leadership staff. And, for the first time, the leadership staff on both parties is acknowledging, in a compromise resolution, that the United States is involved in refueling Saudi planes and in providing assistance in targeting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The compromise resolution has problematic clauses with regard to Iran. It, in my view, overstates Iran&#8217;s influence in Yemen and I don&#8217;t agree with a number of those provisions. That said, it&#8217;s the first time, we&#8217;re going to get a debate probably in the week of November 13th on Yemen, and it&#8217;s the first time there is actually an acknowledgement and understanding here in the body, that we have been involved with aiding the Saudi bombing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think you&#8217;re making a point that almost no one else on Capitol Hill is making regarding Iran which is that anyone who has studied the Houthi movement in Yemen and also looked at the cables that were published by WikiLeaks going back to the Bush era, the Bush diplomats and the Obama diplomats really rejected this notion that the Houthis were a full-on proxy of the Iranians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it seems as though U.S. military action has kind of created a self-fulfilling prophecy, where now Iran does actually want to get involved in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> I think it&#8217;s pretty well documented that we aided Saudi Arabia, in part because Saudis were upset about the Iran deal and so we said, &#8220;OK we&#8217;ll provide you aid in your efforts in Yemen.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Well, first, the Yemeni people are not a bargaining chip in the geopolitics. I mean we have to have a basic regard for human rights and what has gotten us in trouble in the past is this idea of balance of power politics, where we disregard human rights, disregard the aspirations of people in other parts of the world, and then we wonder why there is cycles of hatred against some of our actions. And so, we&#8217;re making the same mistake here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Secondly, Iran wasn&#8217;t very involved in aiding the Houthis in overthrowing the previous government. The Houthis aren&#8217;t blameless. I&#8217;m sure they have committed actions that have taken lives and one should call them out for that, but it wasn&#8217;t at Iran&#8217;s instigation. The compromise resolution that we have gotten, which finally allows the debate, unfortunately perpetuates this narrative of Iranian involvement in Yemen, but it at least gives us a debate in the House of Representatives — that&#8217;s the first time it&#8217;s ever going to happen — and it at least finally acknowledge is that we have been playing a role in Saudi Arabia, which is, probably seems like common sense and obvious to your listeners, but is a huge step here in the Capitol that we&#8217;re acknowledging the role we&#8217;ve been playing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I know this would never pass, probably either house of Congress, but do you believe that the United States should stop entirely selling weapons to and giving military assistance to Saudi Arabia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Yes, I do. I don&#8217;t think the Saudis&#8217; human rights record or their record in military conflicts are consistent with our values. I don&#8217;t think that we should be engaged in interventionism in the Middle East. I guess my view is we should have a policy of first doing no harm. As you know arming Saddam Hussein to check Iran ended up hurting us. Our overthrow most of Mossadegh back in &#8217;53 ended up hurting us. Our arming the mujahedeen ended up hurting us. So, we have this record of interventionism that has not made us any safer. And I view our pragmatic, or expedient, alliance with Saudi Arabia in the same way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It appears as though the number-two Democrat in the House, Representative Steny Hoyer, has been quietly trying to urge members not to support your resolution, Resolution 81, and one of the people that&#8217;s been lobbying in support of your resolution is the former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, and he told Lee Fang, &#8220;I’ve been making the rounds on the Hill, and I’ve heard from Hill offices that behind the scenes, House Democrats are being urged by Congressman Hoyer’s office not to sign on to H.Con.Res.81.&#8221; What can you tell us about that opposition coming from a very powerful Democrat in the Congress?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Not everyone agrees on every part of our strategy in the Middle East, and I&#8217;m sure I have differences of opinion on what we should do in the Middle East than Steny Hoyer. And I don&#8217;t know his position on the resolution, but in terms of getting the compromise he was genuinely helpful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JS: And as you acknowledge, I mean the compromise was not your preferred version of it, but you&#8217;re playing the game on Capitol Hill to try to get what you think is the greater good accomplished. Is that correct?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> That is correct. I mean look, there are two ways of going about it — I could have walked, we could have blown up the War Powers Act. I would have, you know, been on MSNBC for fifteen minutes talking about the issue. Different people have different judgments. My view is I rather play for the long run, I rather assume that people are of decent and good faith, and in the long run, if you make the case, that they will end up doing the right thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I saw that firsthand in this process, where after people really paid attention and were briefed by the military, they realized that, &#8220;Wow, we are involved in aiding Saudi Arabia. We ought to acknowledge that.&#8221; And I think over time, working within the institutions, giving people credit for coming around and compromising is a more effective strategy to build support, rather than just having the 30 strong progressives who share my perspective beating the drums and then not expanding that coalition.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Had you been in the Congress, what is your position on what the United States should have done in Libya? Because you&#8217;ve been very critical of what has happened as a result of that intervention and the way that the uprising was handled.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Well I don&#8217;t think we should have gotten rid of Qaddafi. I mean, we don&#8217;t have, in my view, right now the credibility in the Middle East to be engaged in regime-change enterprises. When they look at the history going back to the overthrow of Mossadegh, it&#8217;s not clear to me why we think that our going into the Middle East is going to be received in a positive way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so I, what I would say is we should obviously give voice to regimes respecting human rights. We should be willing to meet with dissidents. We should be willing to ask and encourage regimes to change and adopt democratic norms. But we shouldn&#8217;t be going in militarily to depose regimes and we shouldn&#8217;t be calling for regime change. I mean, I believe one of the strategic mistakes we made was in 2011, when we called for regime change in Syria — Assad is a brutal dictator, his father was a brutal dictator, but what that regime change did is create a vacuum and a void and a lot of other groups came into Syria. And we made a situation there worse. And I think the same thing with Libya.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now regarding Africa policy you&#8217;ve been speaking out in the aftermath of the public learning about the killing of four U.S. Special Forces troops in the African nation of Niger. And, you know, the public still has not been given a full accounting of what happened there. And, as you pointed out, 99 percent of Americans had no idea — I think actually maybe that&#8217;s too low of a number — 99.9-infinity percent of Americans had no idea that there were 800 or so U.S. troops on the ground in Niger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What are you doing as a member of the Armed Services Committee to bring to public light what on earth we are doing militarily in all of these nations in Africa?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> We have combat troops in almost 17 countries around the world. Our troops are in harm&#8217;s way in 13 of those countries. We&#8217;ve got, you know, this perpetual war on terrorism. And it hasn&#8217;t been debated in the United States Congress. The American people are in the dark of where we have these troops. The blame is not on our military. The blame is with the elected leaders who are asking our military to be stretched thin around the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What we ought to do — there is a biannual report that the president has to submit in June and in December detailing where we have combat troops and where troops are in harm&#8217;s way. I&#8217;ve heard some of the senators and congressman say, &#8220;Well, we didn&#8217;t know that we had troops in Niger.&#8221; Well, there is not a single member of Congress or a senator who has any reason not to be aware of where we have troops.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My hope is that this next report in December, that should be a major national debate. Every media station and every newspaper should cover that report. Every member of Congress should discuss that report. And so, we have had this extension overseas, this interventionism that really has made us less safe, that&#8217;s perpetuated a cycle of violence. And I think that many Americans are weary of this interventionism. And we need to have this debate in this country, and I believe we need to offer a progressive foreign policy alternative to the neoliberal, neocon vision that has dominated in this war on terror the last 20 years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I give you great credit for the positions that you&#8217;re staking out here and I hope you&#8217;re not a one-term congressman for taking those positions. Final question, Representative Ro Khanna, the issue of the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and either the Russian government or people acting on behalf of Russia. I mean clearly this needs to be investigated, clearly we need to get to the bottom of it. Do you believe that the leadership of your party is assigning this the level of importance that it deserves or is it being assigned too much importance? Where do you fall on this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Of course it&#8217;s a very serious matter. It needs to be investigated. We need to make sure that we don&#8217;t have foreign interference in our elections going forward. And my bigger concern is sort of the sense that the president could fire the FBI director or try to restrict the special prosecutor. That is as corrosive to our Constitution as the original interference.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I have said this before: I believe that there is not anything anyone can say in the United States Congress that is going to change an American voter&#8217;s mind about Donald Trump. The economists talk about perfect information, I believe the American electorate has perfect information about Donald Trump. They are going to make a judgment one way or the other.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think what we can do is offer a vision of where we stand. Obviously, the election was a rejection of both parties. There was probably a rejection of foreign policy interventionism. It was a rejection of an economic system that people felt didn&#8217;t include them. It was a rejection of a status quo they thought was too dominated by special interests. So, what we should say is, &#8220;We heard you. And here is what we&#8217;re responding, here is our positive vision. So that if you reject Donald Trump, if you come to the conclusion that he is not the person that he said, that the promises he made on the campaign trail is not what he is living by, here is our vision of what we want to do.&#8221; I hope we can spend more time articulating our positive vision.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I fear you have an uphill battle, within your own party, trying to convince others of that narrative. But I give you tremendous credit for fighting the good fight. Representative Ro Khanna, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Representative Ro Khanna represents California&#8217;s 17th Congressional District. This is his first term in office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Over the past week, President Donald Trump has intervened in the judicial process of two high-profile cases. In one instance, Trump called for the death penalty or the execution of the Uzbek immigrant who plowed into a crowded bike path on New York City&#8217;s West Side Highway, killing eight people and wounding more than two dozen others. Trump called for his execution before he was actually officially charged with a crime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And in the second instance, Trump denounced a U.S. military judge who sentenced U.S. Army deserter Bowe Bergdahl to no time in jail. Bergdahl had abandoned his base in Afghanistan and was ultimately captured by the Taliban and held in what he described as a metal cage for about five years. Bergdahl was also dishonorably discharged and fined.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump, throughout his entire campaign for president, used Bergdahl as a kind of talking point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> So, we get a traitor named Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten traitor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And said things like, &#8220;He should be shot as a traitor. Not even given a trial.” Trump, at one point, suggested Bergdahl should be “thrown from a plane with no parachute.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After Bergdahl&#8217;s sentence, Trump tweeted from Air Force One, about to take off for his trip to Asia, &#8220;The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss Trump&#8217;s intervention in criminal and military cases, I&#8217;m joined now by Colonel Morris Davis. He is the former chief prosecutor at the Guantanamo prison. He resigned in protest over the way prosecutions were being handled there and his opposition to what he believed was improper political pressure being put on him and his colleagues. Davis also recently won a First Amendment case after he was fired from a different military position after writing an op-ed criticizing Guantanamo and the military commissions process. Colonel Morris Davis, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Colonel Morris Davis:\u003c/strong> Oh, thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is your response to that reaction from a sitting president of the United States to a terror case that happens on U.S. soil?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> You know, the prosecution would appear to have a very, very solid case and have the president complicate that by injecting in the military, what we call command influence, would just make it that much more difficult to seat a jury in the event the individual receives the death penalty, potentially creating an appellate issue, that, you know, was influenced or biased by the president&#8217;s comments, and it just makes the process more difficult than it needs to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the grand scheme of things, they&#8217;re murder cases, and to try to make them more complicated than they have to be just really serves no useful purpose.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The United States does a very effective job of prosecuting terror cases in its own court system. In fact, just based on the numbers, a far more successful job post-9/11, actually getting justice or prosecuting terrorists than what has occurred at Guantanamo. Is that correct in your assessment?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Yeah, absolutely. It was, I guess a little bit encouraging to hear the president kind of make that acknowledgement himself, you know where he admitted that this person should be prosecuted in federal court in New York City, because it would be a lot faster and more effective than sending him to Guantanamo where he could potentially sit for years, and I think the president&#8217;s basing that on the ongoing 9/11 — Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. and his group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and fourteen high-value detainees arrived during my tenure as chief prosecutor. They landed, coming from the CIA black sites in September of 2006, so it&#8217;s been more than eleven years since they got to Guantanamo, and they still don&#8217;t have a trial date.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know, I give credit, I guess, to president Trump for recognizing that the military commissions have largely been a failure and that the federal courts have been very effective in dealing with these kinds of cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And yet, at the same time, Trump campaigned in part on this sort of reverse Obama, this sort of pledge to fill Guantanamo back up again and has said things like:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Torture works. Okay, folks. I have these guys, &#8220;Torture doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; Believe me, it works.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> I guess your definition of what I do, I&#8217;m going to leave that to your imagination. But I will tell you, I would be very tough on the families, because the families know what&#8217;s happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He may have made a statement that you rightly give him credit for that we should do this in federal courts, but that flies in the face of a lot of other things that he&#8217;s said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Well I guess fortunately so far a lot of what he&#8217;s said, particularly on the campaign trail and even continuing now that he&#8217;s in office, you know has proven to be bluster. With filling up Guantanamo, and torture, and military commissions, and I don&#8217;t know what the, perhaps the moderating, influence has been on him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, you know, the record so far has shown that you know Guantanamo has been a failure. You know, the most recent person to be found guilty and sentenced at Guantanamo was a one star Marine Corps general.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Back in September 2006, when the plane landed and fourteen guys got off the airplane, there&#8217;s only one who&#8217;s been tried, convicted, sentenced, the case has been through the appellate process, all the way to the Supreme Court, who denied cert, it&#8217;s over and done and that was Ahmed Ghailani, who was the only Guantanamo detainee ever brought to the U.S. and he was prosecuted in federal court.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you compare him to the other thirteen men that got off the plane with him that day and they’re still waiting on a court date at Guantanamo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How many successful prosecutions that resulted in a conviction or acquittal actually took place at Guantanamo from the beginning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Since President Bush authorized military commissions in November 2001, there have been a total of eight cases that have been through a finding of guilty and a sentence that has been imposed. A number of those were overturned on appeal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As an example, during my tenure, there were three people that I personally charged prior to the time I resigned. And that was David Hicks, Omar Khadr and Salim Hamdan. All three of them were ultimately convicted and sentenced, but when their cases came up on appeal to the D.C. circuit, you know, which is generally viewed as one of the more conservative circuit courts of appeal, they found that the offense to which they&#8217;d been found guilty of providing material support for terrorism was not a legitimate law of war offense at the time of their conduct. So, their findings and sentences were set aside.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s been kind of typical, you know, it seems like there&#8217;s a step forward, two steps back. I guess really the only case you could say has been a successful prosecution was the al Bahlul case, which the Supreme Court recently denied cert.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But again, it&#8217;s a relative term calling that success, al Bahlul boycotted his trial and refused to participate, so it&#8217;s kind of a forfeit. But he was convicted and sentenced to life and the Supreme Court has refused to hear his case, so I suppose you could say that&#8217;s been the one success in the 16 years of effort in Guantanamo.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And this is, out of my understanding, a total of 775 prisoners held at Guantanamo since Bush first opened it in the context of the war on terror.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Right and I&#8217;m sure you recall back in the day when we were told that all these men were the worst of the worst and the kind of people that would, you know, “chew through the hydraulic lines on the airplane flying to Guantanamo just to kill Americans.” And I believe the total I saw was 778. Out of that number there are currently 41 that are still there. A number of those have been cleared to be repatriated, if there&#8217;s a country that will take them. And just unfortunately the Obama Administration wasn&#8217;t able to complete that effort before leaving office. But there&#8217;s probably less than two dozen that will ultimately be tried and prosecuted and have their day in court, out of a total of 778, they were all supposed to be the “worst of the worst.” So, I think that pretty much shows that what we were told was not truthful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you believe that incidents such as the one that occurred recently in New York, would you categorize those as acts of terrorism?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> To me terrorism is an act that&#8217;s committed with an objective of achieving some type of political purpose, you know, is using fear and terror and intimidation to try to bend the public or elected officials to the will of the party that it is carrying an act. The shooting in Texas appears to be motivated by, you know, a domestic dispute and hatred towards the family of an ex-spouse or something to that effect, where the act in New York appears to be more, you know, based on ideology than some type of criminal intent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I think we get too hung up on that label of terrorism, and, at the end of the day does it really matter? And I guess one of the cases where it really came to light was Major Nidal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re referring to Nidal Hasan who was a U.S. Army psychiatrist that then opened fire on his colleagues in the military at the U.S. military base at Fort Hood in Texas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Correct and Major Hasan, if you recall, there was a big debate on whether this was an act of domestic terrorism, and why wouldn&#8217;t President Obama call it terrorism, and it doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s murder. The elements of murder are what they are whether you call it terrorism or not. So, I think in a lot of these cases, whether we put the terrorism label on it is largely driven by politics and not the practicality of the law. At the end of the day, for the law, it&#8217;s, you know, murder is murder, whether you call it terrorism or not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The reason I&#8217;m asking if you consider this attack in New York to be terrorism is because there is a distinctly different way that the president, as well as many people in both parties, but more so in the Republican Party, when a Muslim is doing the shooting, it&#8217;s immediately designated as terrorism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We now see this emerging pattern that when white people conduct mass shootings, the reaction of the president in one case is to say, &#8220;Well, he seemed like a very smart guy, but clearly something went wrong. He was deranged.&#8221; The president called this guy who did the attack in New York:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> This animal who did the attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The shooter in Las Vegas was:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> A sick person but probably smart.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This shooting in Texas is about:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Mental health is your problem here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But when it&#8217;s a Muslim, Trump calls for the death penalty right away, which he certainly hasn&#8217;t done for any of these mass shooter incidents where white people were the culprit. Is it actually any different in your view as to how we as a society should react to it or the judicial system should handle it when we&#8217;re talking about white men who are mass shooters versus Muslims who are killing because they&#8217;ve pledged their allegiance to al Baghdadi and ISIS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD: \u003c/strong>It seems that, you know, the case of this shooting in Texas or the shooting in Las Vegas, that the response is “thoughts and prayers” and if it&#8217;s someone like the individual in New York City then it&#8217;s a radical change in policy that&#8217;s required.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The public, even though we like to say that we never forget, we forget pretty quick. And if they can, you know, drag this out for a week or two it will fade out of public memory and we will move on to the next mass shooting. Where, when you have an incident like in New York City, instantly, you know, we&#8217;ve got to build a wall, we&#8217;ve got to ban people coming to this country and take some really radical steps that are contrary to what have been longstanding American values\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I was looking at the numbers the other day, if you look at this century, count 9/11 in there, there were roughly 3,000 people killed there, there&#8217;s been another 100, 200 people in the U.S. that have been victims of what would I think legitimately be characterized as a terrorist attack, and you compare that with, on average, 32,000 people a year that have died by gunshot wound. As an American, your risk of being killed by gunshot versus act of terrorism is 185 to 1. And we&#8217;ll do nothing about the greater risk, we can&#8217;t even talk about it, and we&#8217;ll set aside our values to get rid of or try to mitigate the lesser risk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think that this clearly shows that this is based on politics and not on practical solutions that keep America safe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to get your reaction to the resolution of the Bowe Bergdahl case. Ultimately, the judge decided not to sentence him to any additional time in custody and he had his rank reduced and then he has to pay 1,000 a month in restitution. What&#8217;s your reaction to that sentence?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Unfortunately, this case got wrapped up more in politics and injustice and I think the sentence that was handed down does a lot to maintain confidence in the military justice system.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I was in the system for 25 years and it&#8217;s an outstanding system and I&#8217;m proud of it and I think what the judge did helps to maintain that high standard of military justice. You know, unfortunately in the Bergdahl case, president Obama had the Bergdahl family in the Rose Garden. And people like John McCain used to say we need to do everything possible to get Bergdahl back and then when Obama did what he did, suddenly the people on the conservative side just, you know, went nuts about the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think for the public they&#8217;re under the impression that Bergdahl was the only person that ever deserted. There are hundreds of service members that desert every year. He was in Taliban confinement for five years, and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any disputing that, you know, he was mistreated during that period. So he, you know, he was punished in a way in the dishonorable discharge certainly, you know, is tantamount to a federal felony conviction on his record. So, I think it&#8217;s about right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, one of the reasons for imposing a sentence as a deterrent effect and I don&#8217;t know any service member that looks at what Bowe Bergdahl went through that says, &#8220;Gee, I wish that was me!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I did an op-ed in The New York Times in August of 2016 when you had John McCain railing about Bowe Bergdahl.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator John McCain:\u003c/strong> The problem that I have and many others have is what we paid for that release and that is releasing five of the most hardened, anti-American killers, brutal killers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> At the time, candidate Trump had made him a standard feature of his campaign events.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re tired of Sergeant Bergdahl, who is a traitor. He&#8217;s a traitor — a no good trader — who should&#8217;ve been executed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Trump who went on to be president is now the commander-in-chief and when they&#8217;re stating that a person is prejudged as guilty and should be subject to severe punishment, that&#8217;s command influence and I think the judge did a good job of insulating military justice from command influence and imposing a punishment that struck the balance about right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Can you recall any time when a sitting commander-in-chief intervened in the way that we&#8217;ve witnessed Trump intervening in this Bergdahl case while president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> No, not at all. It&#8217;s unprecedented. When he was a candidate it was one thing, once he was sworn in, he is the commander-in-chief, and he is at the very tip top of the military justice system. He has authority as president. He can mitigate sentences. He can set aside findings. I mean ultimately the military justice system, you know, where the buck stops is on his desk and for someone with that kind of power to inject themselves and predetermine guilt and a sentence is really detrimental to the military justice system.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know it&#8217;s clear that the President Trump has a track record of not taking kindly to people not doing what he says they ought to do. And so, for the military judge to stand up to the commander-in-chief and say, &#8220;I hear you but I&#8217;m not doing it&#8221; really says a lot about the courage and integrity of the judge. I know that you&#8217;re not any kind of a rabid partisan. My sense of you is that you sort of call it like you see it. In recent days, though, on Twitter you very passionately have gone after the president and you have also criticized left-wing opponents of Hillary Clinton. And I&#8217;m wondering where you fall on the spectrum of the kind of #resistance embrace of people like George W. Bush and David Frum and others who were key players in the Iraq war and implementing the sort of borderless global war just because they happen to say some critical things about Donald Trump or, in the case of George W. Bush said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t vote. I voted for none of the above.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Given your opposition to Trump, do you view George Bush and David Frum as your allies in this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> No, and I guess it&#8217;s by way of comparison. You know, you don&#8217;t realize how good or bad something is until you have another object to compare it to. And I guess by comparison they look better than they did back then. But you can&#8217;t rewrite history. And the facts are what they are, you know, what we did during the Bush Administration after 9/11, you know, engaging in torture. And we led the effort to create the Geneva Conventions in the wake of World War II, after we saw the atrocities that were committed in, you know, with an objective to bring the world up to a certain standard.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And after 9/11, when that standard was viewed as an impediment, then we just tossed it aside. We like to say that we&#8217;re the home of the brave, but we became the cowardly after 9/11 and set our values aside. So, the fact that they&#8217;re saying things now that I may tend to agree with does not erase the past history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You may have seen last week the former Attorney General Holder was bragging that, you know, &#8220;I was right, you know, these cases should have been tried in federal court and not in military commission.&#8221; Well, you know, I got fired for writing an op-ed that said that in 2009, and it was his Justice Department that spent six and a half years doing everything possible to shut me up in federal court. So, I don&#8217;t have a warm fuzzy feeling from either of the prior Administrations for some of the things they did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, again, I think by comparison they look better than they did at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We should never forget the scope of the destruction, not only around the world, but to our own purported values in this country that took place during those eight years of Bush and Cheney. And, also, a lot of liberals looking the other way or openly supporting Obama policies that were largely lifted from the Bush-Cheney playbook. So I really do appreciate your principle on this matter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Oh, thanks. Unfortunately, not much has changed over the past decade and I think one of the big mistakes that was made was when president Obama early on said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to look forward and not back.&#8221; And basically has had a policy of impunity for torture, which leaves the door open for people like candidate Trump, you know, to go out and say the things he did about, you know, “we&#8217;ll do waterboarding and worse.” You know, there&#8217;s no excuse for some of the things that we did and there needs to be an accounting for what we did and we need to own up to it to where we leave the door open for us to repeat it and we sanction other countries to engage in that kind of behavior. So, I guess I&#8217;m still optimistic that at some point, you know, we&#8217;ll look back at what we did and take account of it and acknowledge what we did was wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why is Guantanamo still open today and how could we actually realize an aim of closing the place?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Well, I think Guantanamo&#8217;s open today because president Obama said he wanted to close it. Had he said in January of 2009, &#8220;I love Guantanamo and I&#8217;ll keep it open forever,&#8221; then Mitch McConnell and the Republicans would have done everything possible to shut it down by the end of the month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It became a political issue. You know, if you recall back during 2008, during the campaign, John McCain and Barack Obama both said they wanted to close Guantanamo. So, there was a point in time where closing it was a nonpartisan issue. I don&#8217;t think anyone can give you an honest list of positive things that Guantanamo has done. It&#8217;s been, I think we&#8217;ve spent $5.5 billion on the detention operations alone at Guantanamo, which held 778 men over its history and only 41 that are there now. It&#8217;s just an enormous waste of money. It&#8217;s a black eye for America around the world. It&#8217;s, you know, when you see ISIS, when they were executing people, they put them in orange jumpsuits and they did that for a reason, because that represented Guantanamo, so to me, there are no positive things you can say about Guantanamo. There&#8217;s a whole long list of negative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Maybe I&#8217;m wrong. It at least seems that president Trump has recognized maybe some of the shortcomings of military commissions and Guantanamo itself and no one has been sent there in recent years and hopefully that trend will continue because it&#8217;s a chapter in our history that I&#8217;m confident that at some point we&#8217;ll look back on with regret. And I&#8217;m hopeful still at some point, when I&#8217;m talking about Guantanamo, I&#8217;ll be talking about it in the past tense rather than the present.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Colonel Morris Davis, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MD:\u003c/strong> Thank you Jeremy.

He&#8217;s the former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This week the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, along with 95 international news outlets, published a massive trove of documents that they labeled, the Paradise Papers. The more than 13 million documents are from a leading offshore law firm Appleby. And they paint a picture of the global elite, shielding themselves from taxes, from accountability, public scrutiny of their financial dealings. The documents also reveal relationships of powerful individuals to a variety of governments, shell companies and shady individuals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Included in this dump are files related to more than 120 political figures or world leaders, including Queen Elizabeth. They also contain information about more than a dozen people connected to Donald Trump, including his commerce secretary Wilbur Ross.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These documents being published comes as the GOP is engaged in a major push of its tax reform plan, that many economists say is going to bring the greatest benefit for the already wealthy in America, and for large corporations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss the Paradise papers and the GOP tax plan, I&#8217;m joined now by Nomi Prins. She is a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, she also worked for Bear Stearns. More recently she&#8217;s become an author and a journalist, and her latest book is &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Bankers: The Hidden Alliances That Drive American Power.&#8221; She also has a new book coming out next year called, &#8220;Collusion: How Central Bankers Rigged the World.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nomi Prins, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nomi Prins:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much for having me today.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, Nomi, let&#8217;s begin. Your reaction to the importance of this massive amount of information that&#8217;s been published under the banner of the Paradise Papers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> You know, first of all I think that all of this research all these investigations into the details that we don&#8217;t get to see from the companies involved, from the sort of individually elite involved are so important to keep going. This particular one, the leak of 13.4 million or so files that went into offshore tax shelters is really just another important delving into. There are so many legalities that are a component of allowing wealthy individuals, powerful individuals, powerful companies to avoid paying taxes that that gray line between legal and illegal almost doesn&#8217;t matter. The net result is that they have ways of keeping money that should be counted for government and other types of revenue, away from government and types of other revenue. And that means that for the shortfall, for the gap involved, people have to make up the difference. People don&#8217;t have the luxury of hiring companies like Appleby to hide their money, which was the law firm itself that was at the center of this particular leak that was exposed through the Paradise Papers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other takeaway from this is that it just underscores the level of complicity in tax avoidance that our president currently has with respect to the individuals he&#8217;s chosen as either cabinet members or as advisers. And that, that&#8217;s another aspect. So, you look at a cabinet member, which is Wilbur Ross, which is our commerce secretary, or you look at an adviser such as Gary Cohn, who&#8217;s the chief economic adviser to the Trump Administration, and you realize that these people have for years sheltered their money from being used for the public good or the public revenue that the government needs to function.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And I love all people: rich or poor. But in those particular positions, I just don&#8217;t want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that sense? [laughter and applause] If you insist, I&#8217;ll do it. But I like it better this way. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> The other main thing about this is it shows yet another component, because there&#8217;s been many analysis on this including from the Office of Accountability in Washington, that there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of tax avoidance from the largest multinational companies, including, in this particular trove, Nike and Apple, but, I&#8217;m sure there are others that will come out in the data, that routinely not just look at one type of tax shelter or hire one law firm or one accountancy firm to help with tax avoidance, but have that on record is the way in which they do business on a multi-year, multi-billion type of basis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And, specifically about Wilbur Ross, one of the facts that&#8217;s emerged in the early stages of this reporting is that Wilbur Ross, who is the Commerce Secretary, has a stake in a shipping company that has gotten up almost $70 million in revenue since 2014 from an energy company in Russia that&#8217;s co-owned by a son-in-law of Vladimir Putin. And, of course, with everything happening now with the Mueller investigation into Russia that seems to be the initial story that sort of grabbing headlines right now as regards Trump&#8217;s inner circle.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> Right, and part of that is because the relationships weren&#8217;t fully disclosed. Ross is talking about how he&#8217;s been taking money out of that company, he&#8217;s been definancing in or whatever as a result of him having become commerce secretary, and he was going to do that anyway, even without disclosures of those relationships of his companies. But the reality is he probably wasn&#8217;t, we can&#8217;t know, but usually these things are hidden for a reason. And they&#8217;re not disclosed for a reason, which is because they are set in place, they make money for both sides, and they&#8217;re easy to keep from transparency. In the case of Wilbur Ross&#8217; company that has gotten payments from Vladimir Putin&#8217;s son in law&#8217;s company, which is the equivalent of Jared Kushner effectively paying someone in Russia for the same thing or one of his companies doing the same thing, so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of a pretty tight connection except for the fact that Putin&#8217;s son-in-law isn&#8217;t one of the advisers in Putin&#8217;s government, whereas Jared Kushner is one of the advisers in Trump&#8217;s government, but I digress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the point is that this is — this is important, yes, because of the investigations and because a lot of the investigations that Mueller is doing relate to the trail of money. People that he&#8217;s indicted so far, he&#8217;s indicted on various counts of money laundering and other things that involve moving money through channels that are offshore, that are between countries, that sort of culminate offshore between individuals that keep that secret. And for Wilbur Ross to have that as well and to not disclose that, is only another point of contact within the Trump Administration where there is that connection into Russia which is being investigated and there&#8217;s a real train of money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now it might not be illegal in his case, it just looks bad, which is also apropos of a lot of what happens in the Trump Administration, that line of legality and that line of immorality and unethical behavior is very blurred, in general, with people in sort of the elite sect, but in particular in the Trump Administration, and that&#8217;s where Wilbur Ross comes in. This is the guy who is in charge effectively of the relationships of major companies including things like shipping companies by running commerce with international counterparts. That&#8217;s his job inside of Washington and that&#8217;s where it all culminates together. It&#8217;s the Russia connection, it&#8217;s the lack of disclosure, it&#8217;s the fact that he enriches himself by doing so, he enriches himself by not having appropriate disclosure channels. And it is related ultimately to some kind of money flows going to and from the Trump Administration. And people in sort of the Russian government or the Russian elite companies or individuals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why would these wealthy individuals or these companies, like, what is the ultimate point of using these offshore accounts?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> Well there&#8217;s two ways and two reasons for using offshore accounts. The major way is to avoid paying taxes on gains. They could be actual cash, they could be assets, they could be real estate deals, they could be, you know, options on various types of bonuses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, and I haven&#8217;t seen this in these documents because it would be a sort of very detailed kind of line item, but some of the organizations, the banks, major corporations that pay people in options occasionally use or often use offshore tax shelters to finagle what&#8217;s actually ultimately going to be a cash payment from the options on their shares in the company, or not. And so there&#8217;s ways to basically take the complexity of some financial instrument, and mix it with the complexity of a tax shelter, and mask it with a lack of a transparent trail to the IRS. And the reason anybody would use that, any company or individual would use that, is to avoid disclosing their net wealth or their net profits or their net revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other reason to do it, and this is less so, right now, because there is so much sort of cash fusing about the world in the last ten years since the crisis — particularly for the wealthier individuals who have been able to invest it because they&#8217;ve had more access to it and the corporations have used it to do things like buy back their own shares and other types of things that don&#8217;t necessarily involve actual development or, you know, or really creating jobs or increasing wages — but is to hide losses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Often, and this happened back, and this goes back to some the scandals of Enron and so forth, you know, that these companies, and even Citigroup more recently, have multiple tax shelters where they can effectively stash things that might be losing money and so it doesn&#8217;t look as bad on their main books.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that&#8217;s more for corporations and individuals, and so that they can appear healthier, to investors to shareholders, to analysts from Wall Street or what have you, and that&#8217;s another reason to use them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the biggest reason that we know about and we see, and that detracts most obviously from money that comes into the different governments that house these wealthy individuals or corporations that avoid their taxes is that not enough money goes in that should be going in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are certain levels of taxation, for example, in the United States, corporations are technically supposed to pay 35 percent taxes on the profitability that they incur on an annual basis. But if they hide that profitability in various companies that they create or various tax shelters that then connect to those companies, and other tax shelters that connect to those tax shelters, because normally it&#8217;s not just a direct chain, and that&#8217;s why this analysis is so important and the research is so intense and you need so many journalists and people on it is, because there&#8217;s multiple levels of sheltering within a shelter, there&#8217;s almost never just one shelter. But all of that is done to really protect the knowledge of profitability to individuals of their assets, of their money and to corporations for the same things. And that, again, keeps it from the various governments that are connected to them under which they operate or hire people, whatever, on a regular basis and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re used. And again, the other thing is to hide losses to also make themselves look better and they can use different, you know, sort of shelters for different purposes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Nomi, you yourself, at a different point in your life, were a managing director at Goldman Sachs, you also were at Bear Stearns. Part of the reason why I wanted to talk to you because, for all of Donald Trump&#8217;s attacks on Hillary Clinton during the campaign and the speeches that she gave at Goldman Sachs, Trump has had more Goldman Sachs alums in his Administration at this point than any other president in history in terms of just the number this early on in his time in office. And you have a piece this week about the treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, and one of the things that Mnuchin has been doing for the Administration is sort of threatening the public with financial disaster if a tax reform plan is not pushed through. And he&#8217;s done this on national television, he&#8217;s also done it in various summits where he&#8217;s saying, look:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Steve Mnuchin:\u003c/strong> I think to the extent that we get the tax deal done, the stock market will go up higher but there&#8217;s no question in my mind if we don&#8217;t get it done, you&#8217;re going to see a reversal of a significant amount of these gains.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is your analysis of what is happening right now on Wall Street under Donald Trump where Trump himself says you know, &#8220;Every single day we break a new record, 65 records since I became president on the Dow alone.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> I think that there&#8217;s a couple ways to consider what Mnuchin is doing. On the one hand, it&#8217;s completely out of the playbook of a former Goldman Sachs alum, who is the CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs before he became Treasury Secretary for George Bush, and that was during the time of the financial crisis where he sort of got down on one knee in front of Nancy Pelosi, who was speaker of the House, and said, &#8220;If you guys don&#8217;t pass,&#8221; i.e. Congress, &#8220;this bailout bill for the banks all the ATMs are going to cease to give money to people and there&#8217;s going to be Armageddon and so forth.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Hank Paulson:\u003c/strong> We must do so in order to avoid a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets that threaten American families&#8217; financial well-being, the viability of businesses both small, and large, and the very health of our economy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> And that was a way of basically tying Congress or at least threatening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re referring of course to the former Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s correct, who is also the former treasury secretary. And of course Steve Mnuchin, who was only a former partner at Goldman Sachs and not the CEO, but still pretty high — actually he left when I left so he&#8217;s done a lot of other things since then — but the point is that the way in which both Hank Paulson back at the times of the bailouts in the beginning of the crisis, and Steve Mnuchin, who&#8217;s kind of using the same tactic to threaten the sort of health and level of the stock market if these tax cuts for corporations, which is mostly what he&#8217;s talking about when he makes that threat, don&#8217;t go through, it&#8217;s really the same thing — it&#8217;s really this instilling fear in Congress and perhaps the greater public to sort of be quiet about it with respect to Congress, that if certain things aren&#8217;t done to effectively help companies in the beginning of the crisis, it was to specifically help the banking industry from getting out of their own, the messes that they created, many of which, much of which was created illegally. And now with respect to corporations, what Steve Mnuchin was talking about and is talking about an is stumping about, is a 42 percent tax slash in the actual substantive rate of taxation for corporations. And that is a substantial, going from 35 percent to 20 percent, which is in the GOP bill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And his reasoning for that, and for connecting it to the stock market, and why Trump connects everything to the stock market, is because it is the one thing that you can objectively look at that has a number that has gone up. You can&#8217;t do that with wages. You can&#8217;t do that with job quality. You can&#8217;t do that job longevity. You can&#8217;t do that with your health coverage. You can&#8217;t do that with lots of other things that most people count on for their day-to-day lives and to make the day to day payments and money that they need to survive them. But what the stock market shows is not, not the expectation that there was going to be a tax cut. What the stock — which is what he&#8217;s saying, what the stock market shows is that for all of this period, and it happened during Obama as well, and yes it&#8217;s continued under Trump, there&#8217;s been a situation where companies have been able to receive very cheap money, because our rates are close to zero and they have been since the financial crisis, in order to subsidize the money that was lacking at the time for the banking system, that money has gone to banks, banks have bought back their own shares, banks pay themselves dividends on their own shares that they bought. That pumps the stock market up. That&#8217;s a significant set of buyers for their own stock.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The same thing in companies throughout all of the different industries spectrums. They get the ability to issue cheap debt, or basically to borrow money cheaply because rates are so low, they use that money not necessarily to expand. Some of it they hide, as we were talking about earlier, some of it they use to buy back their own stock which enriches the top level of those firms, and it also pushes the stock market up, and then they also get dividends on their own stock.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So all of that is more why the stock market has continued to rise throughout Obama&#8217;s administration as well as with Trump in there now. Because nothing has been done to effectively change that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mnuchin and Trump have added onto that, sort of taken credit for it, by saying, &#8220;Well, because of us, because of these plans, because of expectations on these plans things are going up.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No! Banks don&#8217;t buy stock on expectations of plans. They buy stock because they have the money to do it and they&#8217;re not, they don&#8217;t have to do anything else with it. Like, let&#8217;s say reserve it in case we have another emergency crisis and they, you know, need to go back to the government for additional subsidies. That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They&#8217;re also, because of Mnuchin, and Trump, which he doesn&#8217;t talk about in the scare tactics, is looking forward to more deregulation in terms of the rules under which they provide their services. So rather than doing what Trump promised he would do, he promised a lot of things that he&#8217;s not doing, but one of the things he promised to do was to actually break up banks, to bring back Glass-Steagall, the real one, from 1933, not some pseudo, weird one that Mnuchin talks about that would actually require banks to split up, to use their deposits and their loans for real banking services, to bet when they need to on the side, and knock down the subsidies from the Federal Reserve or the government. That&#8217;s not what&#8217;s happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So if anything, if there&#8217;s any modicum of rising that can be attributed to policies that this Administration is pushing and to which Mnuchin in particular is pressing, it&#8217;s the level of deregulation. It&#8217;s not necessarily a taxation expectation because that hasn’t really been baked in, where certain deregulation movements have already been baked in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m not an economist and I really struggle sometimes to understand, when you go to the RNC, for instance, the Republican National Convention, where they anoint their nominee and you talk to people that are there as delegates from around the country, there are a lot of working class people that are there, there are people who are struggling with a small business, and this is sort of the bread and butter of who you meet at the Republican National Convention. It&#8217;s not — yes you have the elite, high-end donors that are in the suites and all of that stuff is going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But just sort of rank and file, and I&#8217;ve gone to most of them since 1996, I&#8217;m astonished. It feels like you&#8217;re at like a used car salesman convention, and I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand how the Republican tax plan or the Trump presidency ultimately is going to benefit any of those people. Like what, what am I missing here? Who is this actually going to help?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> If tax cuts go through for companies, it will help those people who are already stashing money, not to bring it back, and to basically enrich themselves. It will help, you know, people with wealthy estates preserve it for their families. It will not help —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But these are not small business owners. Like, small business owners are not, you know, camping their assets in an island somewhere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> No. And that&#8217;s the whole point. It is expensive. You know? I don&#8217;t know if this is, this is somewhere with the documents, or in these documents, but I mean, there are some significant fees per hour that are being paid to the types of accountants and service providers that hide, or allow, these companies and these individuals to hide their money. This is not something a small business can afford. It&#8217;s not something an actual person can afford for the most part. You know, these are things that to begin with that require significant amounts of capital in order to make them happen. So just from the sheer standpoint of setup, there&#8217;s a lot of costs. And so, no, it doesn&#8217;t impact small businesses. And the idea that somewhere along the line the tax cuts that are being proposed can put an extra $1,100 in the middle class pocket, well, maybe, but if you look at all the things that they want to remove from middle class benefits, whether that&#8217;s sort of dependents, it&#8217;s medical expense deductions, it&#8217;s student loan expense deductions, I mean it&#8217;s things that really hurt, when they get out of whack, individuals and that if you have a middle class income you can kind of deduct these things against it and if you can&#8217;t deduct them that could be the difference. It could be way over $1,100 per person or per filing unit. And so, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It only helps people — well, it actually doesn&#8217;t help the people that come to those conventions unless they&#8217;re really rich. And, the point is, those are the people that are actually affecting the tax code and are in the offices and are in the dinners and are in the meetings and are at the golf courses with the individuals who are trying to push on to everybody else the idea that their plans will be beneficial to them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And they&#8217;re actually not! We have seen that. I mean the whole reason that there&#8217;s been so much — that there was such dissatisfaction into this particular election and it&#8217;s split between Trump and I think Bernie Sanders. And it kind of got missed by, by the Clinton camp. But the reality is there&#8217;s a lot of economic uncertainty here and that is because people don&#8217;t have the ability to pay for regular things they need, whether that is health care, whether that&#8217;s education whether that&#8217;s just ordinary bills. And so, the idea of a minor tax cut to them, I think is just a bone relative to everything it contributes to anyone who already has money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And you, of course, have been an adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders both as a senator and when he was running his presidential campaign through his Federal Reserve Reform Advisory Council. I mean we&#8217;re hammering away on Trump and the Republicans here, as we should, they&#8217;re in control right now, but are the Democrats institutionally all that much better than what Trump and the Republicans are offering?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> No, they&#8217;re less specific about some of the things that won&#8217;t be beneficial to everyone. They certainly, as a group, take a lot of money from Wall Street. I mean we know that president Obama&#8217;s major donors in his original campaign included, three of five of them were major banks including Goldman Sachs, as is his number two one. Hillary Clinton&#8217;s connections to Goldman Sachs and Bill Clinton&#8217;s connections to Goldman Sachs are legendary. And, you know, we could we could talk about that for a really long time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the reality is that the elite structure that catapults many people into politics, particularly from a generational or family or sort of connection basis relative to people running individually on their own sort of from outside that, and when you look at the level of wealth that they have going into that, it is not necessarily better in the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. I mean look at Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s wealth. But the point is, you know, how you use it and the Democrats I think have been guilty certainly since the financial crisis, and this is less Bernie Sanders, but not pushing for, say, breaking up banks, and not pushing for a better health care system that&#8217;s more on the order of a single payer. And so, I think that many of the Democrats have been guilty of that as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With respect to Bernie Sanders, he&#8217;s been a big advocate for all of those things. And so there&#8217;s a faction of the Democratic party that gets that. When I say get that, I mean that gets that things have to be significantly changed, not just changed a little bit. Not just Dodd-Frank, for example, which is one of the regulations that came out against banking in the wake of the financial crisis, but didn&#8217;t really break up the banks. You know, not that kind of half-done sort of stuff but actually going full throttle and really fighting for major kind of FDR types of changes, but also considering that their constituents from the business side and the Wall Street side, yeah, they&#8217;re not going to like that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the way I look at politics is, you know, you&#8217;re in there. You can do a tremendous amount of good for a greater number of people, or not, or you can continue to do it for, you know, so the comfortable group that you come from that support you on a more, you know, sort of acute basis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, yeah, the Democrats are equally responsible, when they were in control, of not pushing through more inequality-reducing, more economically stabilizing types of measures.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know as we wrap up here, I want to sort of just ask you a question I think a lot of particularly young people who have very little savings, there&#8217;s almost no such thing as a pension anymore in this country. You&#8217;ve got the 401k match, you know, and if your employer is decent, they give you a decent match, and they contribute to it, you know, dollar for dollar, up to a certain point. But in reality, all of our futures are being gambled with by the very people that you&#8217;re talking about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What would like a just system look like in terms of securing your retirement, and not having your money gambled with, and the rules that we actually should be embracing in our society? Like, in your view, what makes sense for how we save up for our retirements or how we protect our families or how we don&#8217;t lose our homes? Like, what should be happening at an institutional level to change the reality, particularly that a lot of young people are going to be facing, but also people that are retiring right now are facing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> Again, going back to the beginning of our conversation about the Paradise Papers, there&#8217;s major things that need to be done, for example, if a public official does not disclose their financials, they should not be allowed to be a public official. That should be a thing. That should be a law. We shouldn&#8217;t have to wonder about Trump&#8217;s tax returns and spend multiple investigations trying to figure out where his companies are and who&#8217;s buying what within the various, you know, multiple levels of non-transparency of them. That shouldn&#8217;t be a thing. That would be something that levels the playing field.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Not having a Citizen&#8217;s United aggregate, of where money can come into politics, would be something that levels the playing field. Breaking up banks would be something that levels the playing field for many reasons that are beyond bringing back Glass-Steagall. It would encourage banks to work at the level of taking deposits and giving loans, which would mean they would probably want to have a higher interest rate environment so that people would be able to give them deposits and they would be able to keep them in order to give out loans, it would be much of an easier type of business.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And also that would mean that from a trading perspective, from the standpoint of derivatives, from the standpoint of buying back their own stock, from creating all sorts of complex securities that don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re buying back their own stock but in fact mean that they&#8217;re buying back their own stock, that all of those things would have to be separated so that they, on their own dime, have to take risks, which would require them to significantly reduce their risk. I think those things are important. I think actually having a raise in corporate taxes, rather than a reduction in corporate taxes, that would be something that would also level the stability because you would have more of a way to quantify money coming in versus having to chase it later and all sorts of promises to get it back from these tax shelters which, which aren&#8217;t going to come to fruition. I think we have term limits for the House and not have people there for you 20, 30 years, but have, you know, a certain sort of period of time so they actually have to be more in touch with the people that elect them on a more regular basis, so that they don&#8217;t get as comfortable with the types of companies that push their policies and push, therefore, legislation that isn&#8217;t as stabilizing for the majority of the population, certainly destabilizes the financial markets. I think that needs to happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I mean it&#8217;s really a holistic way of stepping back, and maybe it&#8217;s utopian, but, you know, if you&#8217;re talking about a new generation coming in and being concerned about their future financial stability, how it&#8217;s handled from a from a legislative or law or regulatory perspective, and how the government functions from a sort of ethical or moral perspective matters. And you&#8217;re not going to change everybody&#8217;s behavior by any sort of means overnight or even over decades. But I think these are important things to, to enact and to get moving on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, Nomi, it sounds like you&#8217;re ready to start your campaign for public office. No, no. But folks, listen, I mean, Nomi was at some of the big villainous corporations — Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Chase Manhattan, and others — and, you know, I give you a tremendous amount of credit for taking all of that experience and translating it into information that ordinary people can use to make informed decisions about what policies to support, what policies to oppose. I give you a tremendous amount of credit for the work that you&#8217;ve done.

Aram Roston of Buzzfeed, Spencer Ackerman of the Daily Beast, and The Intercept’s Matthew Cole join Jeremy for a discussion on Trump’s new covert action czar on the National Security Council and his past work for Blackwater’s Erik Prince on the CIA assassination program.

I&#8217;m not saying that this investigation is not important or relevant or necessary. It is. But the emerging pattern is that nothing else matters. And that is extremely dangerous and frankly reckless, particularly when you consider the level of humanitarian destruction and the wars, both covert and overt, that are raging across the globe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s an unspeakable scandal that what the U.S., and Britain, and Saudi Arabia are doing to the people of Yemen is not on every single newscast every single day. The world is witnessing a genocidal war that is made possible by the United States government. For three years, the Saudis have used U.S., British and other Western-supplied weapons to systematically target the civilian infrastructure of Yemen. They have bombed power plants, including destroying the main power grid in the capital, Sana’a.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There is now a horrifying outbreak of cholera. More than a half a million Yemenis have been infected with the disease this year alone. Two thousand people, most of them children, have died from the cholera outbreak. By next month, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, there are estimates that cholera cases will rise to about one million. This is a direct result of the scorched-earth bombing that the United States is facilitating.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some seven million Yemenis are facing what a coalition of 20 international aid groups call famine-like conditions. Twenty million people right now have about six weeks left of food rations and the country has a vaccine supply that&#8217;s expected to last no more than a month. People are living in sewage. Hospitals are closing or are totally overwhelmed. Doctors and nurses have not been paid in months. It&#8217;s a matter of time before diseases like polio and measles begin rapidly spreading.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Making matters even worse, the Saudis have imposed an embargo, a blockade on humanitarian supplies coming into Yemen and they&#8217;ve actively prevented ships from delivering desperately needed aid. Now under international pressure in recent days, the Saudis now say that they&#8217;re going to ease that blockade. We shall see. The past three years have shown a ruthless, merciless, and heartless Saudi agenda that is collectively punishing the entire population of the poorest nation in the Arab world, all with the enthusiastic support of the U.S. government under Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Pope Francis&#8217;s envoy to the United Nations warned that the bombing campaign in Yemen is creating, &#8220;a humanitarian disaster of apocalyptic proportions.&#8221; Think of all of this the next time you hear Trump or any other U.S. official talk about how important Saudi Arabia is to the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Secretary Rex Tillerson:\u003c/strong> America&#8217;s security at home is strengthened when Saudi Arabia&#8217;s security is strong as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Or when you hear Trump bragging about weapons sales to the Kingdom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> And we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Think of this when military or intelligence officials claim that the Saudis are an important ally in the fight against terrorism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Secretary James Mattis: \u003c/strong>Well, welcome, your Royal Highness, Excellencies, distinguished members of the Kingdom&#8217;s delegation.

But instead of stopping a genocide, Trump is fueling it, as Obama did before him, albeit with a little bit of feigned concern about the humanitarian conditions in Yemen. This policy is shameful. Utterly shameful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Late on Monday night this week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the civilian deaths and the spread of disease in Yemen. But by the time it was actually voted on, it was so watered down as to be completely meaningless as though it&#8217;s a mystery who&#8217;s doing most of the killing in Yemen. It doesn&#8217;t even mention the Saudis! That resolution will have no actual consequences. It doesn&#8217;t stop the U.S. from selling arms to the Saudis, it doesn&#8217;t stop the U.S. from refueling Saudi warplanes or providing the Saudis with intelligence to wage its bloody air war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In fact, Congress remains totally unwilling to stop this genocide. There are a few who seem to get it, among them Senator Chris Murphy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Chris Murphy:\u003c/strong> I mention that the blockade is being run by the Saudi-led coalition. The United States is a member of that coalition. For two years the United States has been aiding the government of Saudi Arabia in a bombing campaign of the Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. That bombing campaign has caused this outbreak of cholera. Why is that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I don&#8217;t believe that either the Democrats or the Republicans will actually confront this horror with anything except toothless resolutions, but Murphy should be applauded for speaking out. And here&#8217;s the other thing: it&#8217;s not just Yemen. U.S. drone strikes have continued unabated under Donald Trump. There were four in Somalia in the last week alone. Afghanistan is once again escalating. The CIA has been given wider latitude to conduct lethal operations and Trump has removed some of the Obama era approvals that the CIA would need to get in order to conduct drone strikes. Meanwhile, Trump has eased the rules on the military, the U.S. military, killing civilians and the death toll in Syria and Iraq are spiking through the roof since Donald Trump became president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>U.S. Special Operations Forces are deployed in 130-plus countries around the world, but there&#8217;s almost never mention of this in big establishment media. No, all day every day it&#8217;s: Trump, Russia, Trump, Russia, Trump, Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What presidents do, including in their personal lives, when they&#8217;re president, it&#8217;s very important for the media to cover. It was important under Bill Clinton, as it is under Donald Trump. But the point is, at what price does this obsession with a small part of what&#8217;s going on in the United States and around the world, at what price does that obsession and imbalance in coverage come? The secret and public wars that the U.S. has engaged in, they all must be covered in depth regardless of what&#8217;s happening inside the palace at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We are going to pay a price at home for what is done with our money and in our names abroad, and this is all going to come back to hit us as it has before. So, let&#8217;s not fall into this trap of deciding what to cover and in how much depth, as though news organizations are producers of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, or that we&#8217;re somehow cheap ambulance chasers. People are dying in massive numbers because of the actions of our government. Our wars make new enemies every day. And it&#8217;s all of our job, as reporters, as journalists to report on it, regardless of what else is happening in the country or the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Today we&#8217;re going to take a deep dive into some of the stories that you won&#8217;t get much information on from watching the big networks or splashed as breaking news on the websites of the most serious journals of our time.

I&#8217;m glad to be here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Your exposé that was just published this week by BuzzFeed News, the headline CIA Officer Joins NSC (that&#8217;s National Security Council) Staff As Agency Vows To Be More &#8220;Vicious.&#8221; What caught my attention was what is advertised in the subhead, which is “Michael Barry once worked on a CIA assassination program that had been contracted out to the controversy over security contractor Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater.” Who is Michael Barry and what is he doing right now in the Trump Administration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> Michael Barry is a longtime CIA case officer, and he was virtually unknown, he was apparently undercover until now. And he just joined the NSC as the senior director for intelligence programs, which means he functions as a liaison between the White House and the CIA, in terms of covert programs, in terms of covert action.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The reason it&#8217;s so fascinating is, it turns out, according to two sources years ago, over a decade ago, he was involved in a CIA assassination program that we&#8217;ve heard of, we don&#8217;t know too much about it, but we&#8217;ve heard of it. For a brief period for several years it was contracted out to Erik Prince. It was a plan to set up these hit teams that would go do targeted killings of terrorists, and the reports are there never was actually a killing by these teams, but we don&#8217;t really know that. Anyway the sources said that he&#8217;d been attached to that for a little while, and knew Erik Prince from back then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And his current role now, you describe it as being a liaison between the National Security Council and the CIA. What does that mean exactly?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> That means — well the NSC does coordinate and advise the president on matters of national security. On intelligence programs, he&#8217;s the one who does the oversight, in a sense. If there is oversight of the CIA, it&#8217;s really in the senior director&#8217;s hands and he&#8217;s a channel by which the CIA contacts and submits ideas for covert action and policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole, you also know a bit about Michael Barry, who is now Trump&#8217;s point man with the CIA on the National Security Council and you know a bit about Erik Prince. You&#8217;ve been doing some reporting that hasn&#8217;t been published yet that deals with some of what Aram&#8217;s report covers here in BuzzFeed about Erik Prince&#8217;s connections to the current National Security Council in the CIA. What do you have to add to this story, what are you hearing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Matthew Cole\u003c/strong>: Aram&#8217;s story filled in a missing piece that I was trying to understand, which was what the relationship was between Barry and Prince, because we&#8217;ve been told by a good source that in the last month or so, Erik Prince pitched a covert action program to Michael Barry. We don&#8217;t know what the substance of the covert action was, or is. I don&#8217;t believe that the White House was inclined to essentially contract it out to Prince, but what I didn&#8217;t understand until I read Aram&#8217;s story was the background and understanding of how he would have gotten that meeting, especially now that Bannon is gone, because Bannon had been his biggest supporter inside the White House that gave him access until he left.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it is another piece of the puzzle of trying to figure out what Erik Prince is still doing or what he is trying to continue to sell to the U.S. government, now that he has a Republican in office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Spencer, also, we know that Steve Bannon has been flirting with the idea of having Erik Prince run as a Senate candidate in Wyoming. I&#8217;m sort of, I mean I&#8217;m salivating at that possibility on all sorts of levels, but this relationship between Prince, and Bannon, and the Trump White House, and a Senate run.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Spencer Ackerman\u003c/strong>: Well, one thing, you know, to be concerned about, should Prince actually make this run, his connections to agents of the foreign powers, his connections to foreign power, whether it&#8217;s China, whether it&#8217;s the UAE, perhaps this isn&#8217;t the axis on which the Barry appointment turns, but given that you mention the Bannon connection, Aram, Matthew, maybe you guys know: A) Was this Pompeo nominating Barry to this position, which of course is very important to CIA directors, and what&#8217;s his relationship like with H.R. McMaster who famously pushed to get the guy&#8217;s predecessor, Ezra Cohen Watnick, off the NSC from this role.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR\u003c/strong>: I know, I mean, as Spencer was saying, the position&#8217;s really important to the CIA and the predecessor was not CIA, so they wanted him out. And I do not know what Pompeo&#8217;s relationship was with Barry or what Pompeo&#8217;s is, but they must have a decent one, right? Because McMaster&#8217;s accepted him just a month and a half ago. Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Correct. But I want to also highlight this major story that Spencer broke this week on the Daily Beast. The headline: &#8220;Green Beret Discovered SEALs’ Illicit Cash. Then He Was Killed.&#8221; Now, the Green Beret in question, you know from a previous discussion on this show, was killed in Mali, the African nation of Mali, looked like he was strangled. Matthew Cole broke a story last week, identifying one of the SEALs in this case and showing that he, in my opinion, seemed to have kind of a failed career as a mixed martial arts fighter. He&#8217;s one of the people that&#8217;s now being investigated for this killing of a Green Beret.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Spencer then breaks news that really feels like it&#8217;s snatched from some kind of a TV show or a film. The Green Beret had discovered that the SEALs were stealing money from the operational budget on the ground that they were supposed to be using to conduct covert operations?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right. So, this was the first indication we had after chasing the story that The New York Times broke and that Matt advanced, why this Green Beret was killed. The donut hole in the middle of the story was the motive. And we were able to find out, we had five Special Operations sources for this story that what&#8217;s going on in Mali where the U.S. has a minimal troop presence and apparently a robust counterterrorism presence, aiding with the French in fighting a variety of Islamist factions in essentially the Mali-Niger area, that there is some intelligence activity to identify counterterrorism targets that basically amounts to, as we see, in various intelligence activities around the world. A lot of cash being handed out essentially to buy informants or to make informants feel more comfortable coming forward. And this is typically money that&#8217;s not very good at being traced, and you&#8217;re sort of on your honor to properly account for that money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sergeant Melgar, we don&#8217;t entirely know if he was working in this activity or he was just proximate to it, but he discovered information that the two SEALs were skimming money off the top from it and pocketing it. Our sources indicated to us that they tried to cut Melgar in on the action, Melgar declined and an altercation ensued at around 5 am on June 4 in Mali, and Melgar died. It appears, from what we know, that they did not intend to kill him. That they strangled him, that he lost consciousness and that, very alarmingly, he stopped breathing. The SEALs attempted to revive him, my understanding is by opening his throat, that made matters worse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They end up essentially depositing him at a French clinic nearby the U.S. embassy and it turned out he was dead on arrival. This was the first indication that we had about why Sergeant Melgar was killed. In addition to that, we found out that they concocted — the SEALs concocted — a cover story that very quickly fell apart upon forensic examination. They tried to say that Melgar was drunk during combatives, that is a kind of like training exercise, and that he lost consciousness that way. They tried to bring him back, but that essentially his impairment from alcohol was the reason why that he ultimately died. Toxicology came back showing he had neither drugs nor alcohol in his system.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At least one of our sources is under the impression that Sergeant Melgar just didn&#8217;t drink period. Either way, this was a cover story that fell apart so quickly, which also helped explain why the SEALs were taken into custody so quickly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, I just want to be clear here that Spencer as a reporter is speaking in shorthand to explain what his reporting has found, but it&#8217;s important for us to acknowledge that no charges have been filed, and that what Spencer is relaying here is what he&#8217;s heard from sources within the Special Operations community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Matthew you did this massive series, in-depth series, earlier this year on SEAL Team Six, talking about the crimes of SEAL Team Six and also the high points of SEAL Team Six. Most Americans now have probably heard of SEAL Team Six because of the Osama bin Laden raid. But I want to ask you: When you read this reporting from Spencer Ackerman that alleges a plot to steal money from an operation that results in a dead Green Beret, were you at all surprised?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Not at all. I mean, you know, let&#8217;s first start by saying that no one&#8217;s been charged. There&#8217;s not even an allegation yet. We can&#8217;t assume or presume that they&#8217;ve done anything wrong. However, I will say that what has come out so far both from the Times from my reporting and from Spencer&#8217;s at the Daily Beast, the outlines of which fit sadly very well into what SEAL Team Six has done in the past and what they&#8217;re capable of covering up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What I worked on, and continue to work on, is their total lack of acknowledgement or accountability, which is a cultural issue. But the fact is that when they do their job well, they are professional killers and professional criminals. I mean, they steal, they lie and they cheat, and that&#8217;s — they do that on orders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sadly, when units like that, and there is a long history of it in Special Operations and in clandestine units that go without oversight, they tend to cheat. One of the well-known cases the people sort of first got a sense of what SEAL Team Six was or who they were was in the rescue of Captain Phillips from Somali pirates in 2009, and in that case, $30,000 went missing from the lifeboat in which he was rescued. And two members of SEAL Team Six were polygraphed and passed and the NCIS brought no charges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I can tell you, I actually know which two SEALs were polygraphed, I can tell you that I&#8217;ve had sources tell me that the polygraphers who were brought in, were known to SEAL Team Six. That they don&#8217;t have a problem passing polygraphs, and that internally there&#8217;s no doubt in SEAL Team Six&#8217;s minds, in the teammates minds, that those guys stole the $30,000. That doesn&#8217;t mean jack in terms of the court of law, but the idea of skimming off of informant money is sadly not out of the realm of possibility at all for SEAL Team Six.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Aram, you&#8217;ve been covering the world of clandestine ops and proxies for the United States for many years. You wrote an excellent book about Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi quote-unquote opposition figure who was a long time CIA asset and you have covered Blackwater and you&#8217;ve covered the Obama administration&#8217;s counterterrorism. How has the world changed, what are you hearing from sources, what is the landscape like of the kind of world that you&#8217;ve covered as a journalist now under Donald Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> I keep on asking myself that. I guess we all do, right? Obviously the CIA is saying it&#8217;s getting much more aggressive and there&#8217;s a lot of indications the agency itself is getting much more aggressive. But it&#8217;s hard to even look at a difference because we&#8217;re forgetting how aggressive and secretive Obama&#8217;s DOD was, and CIA was, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Have you seen a shift, Spencer, that you could sort of translate into something tangible since Trump became president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> This isn&#8217;t entirely attributable to Trump but it&#8217;s something that seems, it has a lot of momentum behind it, which is: it seems like the next sort of post-Syria center of gravity of what we call the war on terrorism is Africa. And, in particular, it&#8217;s starting to be West Africa. And that&#8217;s one of the reasons that I wanted to follow up on the reports of Sergeant Melgar&#8217;s death — not just because this is a shocking story just in itself that two SEALs are potentially under investigation for killing a Green Beret, but it shows that we&#8217;ve got a whole lot of digging to do around just what U.S. counterterrorism is becoming in a place that had seemed like kind of a backwater to counterterrorism efforts until starting around 2013 when the Niger government signed a Status of Forces Agreement with the Obama administration to construct a drone base. And, you know, that also, I should say, followed on the French-led war in Mali that the U.S. supported, but it seems like there&#8217;s a lot of momentum going to this particular area and that&#8217;s going to mean death, that&#8217;s going to mean dollars, that&#8217;s going to mean atrocities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> I was just going to say, I mean that&#8217;s one of the other things that started the Obama administration, the focus on Africa, and it&#8217;s one of things we didn&#8217;t expect from Trump, right? Because he famously — well at least all signs were — he didn&#8217;t care much about but Africa. I mean one thing that shifted obviously, the idea that the U.S. is fighting for the to hunt down the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army, that&#8217;s gone. But it&#8217;s interesting: this is just part of a process that began under Obama.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Just in the past week, there&#8217;s been three or four drone strikes in Somalia. There are now I think upwards of 400 U.S. troops that are deployed in Somalia, I think most of them are based at the Aden Adde airport, but we have been hearing increased reporting on U.S. troops out in the field in Somalia. My sense isn&#8217;t that like Trump is sort of renewing a focus or turning up the heat in Africa as much as it is that we&#8217;re seeing the agenda of careerists at the CIA or the military being able to implement an agenda in a more radical way than they maybe were able to under Obama. Am I off on that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> No, I think the anecdotal evidence tells us, and there has a been a small amount that&#8217;s been leaked out or reported on, which is that under Obama CIA and DOD felt very constrained by what they could do and where they could go. So, in January, within a week he goes to, he orders the SEAL Team Six raid in Yemen. In March there was a SEAL Team Six operator who was killed in Somalia, in an operation where they were supposed to be just advising on, you know, train and assist or advise and assist. And so, what we&#8217;re finding is that places where quietly the U.S. had moved into, Africa into sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa, parts of East Africa where there had been less concentration, all of that has been ramped up because the approvals have been delegated down and no longer requires the White House to deliberate and make a decision about whether to deploy people. So, I think that we haven&#8217;t seen yet the intensity of it, how intense it is in terms of the change from one administration, but there&#8217;s no question that there has been more going on as a result of the new administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And we recently had Charlie Savage of the New York Times on this program talking about — and he&#8217;s the reporter that really confirmed this — that this updated order of sorts, it&#8217;s not really legally an order, but Trump signed authorizing the U.S. military to conduct operations against terrorists without needing to be as concerned about killing civilians or to be certain that you have a specific individual that is the target of the operation. In other words, if it&#8217;s a certain region and you believe that you have enough evidence to suggest somebody bad is there, go ahead and take the shot, which is different than what Obama said the policy was at the end, Spencer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a relaxation of a bureaucratic constraint, you know, as you mentioned, the sort of legal constraints that were on it are also bureaucratic constraints, they&#8217;re less restrictive once the lawyers get their hands on them than probably you, or I, or the average listener, would think a legal constraint to be. I just want to go to one point that you made in your introduction to that, because you kind of brought out some numbers that really crystallized this. There are four hundred U.S. troops in Somalia. The U.S. has been fighting in Somalia directly and indirectly for a decade.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. has twice that, 800 troops in Niger, a place that most Americans, until the ambush that killed Sergeant La David Johnson and three others, and wounded two others, also Army Special Forces, some of them Green Berets, probably didn&#8217;t know that the U.S. was in at all.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There has been some kind of pushback on that point, given that Congress is informed, but frankly you know how much does Congress actually want to look into this, how deeply does Congress want to look into this beyond the bureaucratic fact of getting a piece of paper passed over to them. That just speaks to the broader point that whatever we thought U.S. operations in East Africa were like, where there has been this apparatus of institutionalization, both physically and bureaucratically/legally, now we&#8217;re seeing quite an extensive and eye-opening expansion of that over to the west of the continent, and that just seems like something that the four of us talking right now are probably going to end up covering for several years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> You guys have convinced, I think you&#8217;ve thought it through a lot more cogently than I have. But I do think a lot of this just started under, its, as you were saying, it&#8217;s the bureaucracy at work, not necessarily Trump. Except for, you know, the CIA says and promises to be much more aggressive in this. I think in a way it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re seeing these bureaucracies clashing a little bit more than we know yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: My sense, and I just want to reiterate this, is that the people that are really kind of running the show at the Pentagon, at Special Operations Command, at the CIA, are probably pretty darn happy that Donald Trump is the Commander in Chief and not Obama, if for no other reason than they can push this envelope that we&#8217;ve all been talking about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean there&#8217;s, right now, Special Operations forces in 130-plus countries around the world. Now they&#8217;re not whacking people in all of those countries. In some cases they&#8217;re just advising a local military force. But increasingly those lines are blurred. I mean, Matthew, when we hear those kinds of statistics, what should we be imagining that they&#8217;re doing? What does Congress know about what they&#8217;re doing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> I think on the granular level Congress doesn&#8217;t know that much because they don&#8217;t ask too many questions. I have heard, by the way, specifically on the continent of Africa, that the edict basically coming down to SOCOM and DOD, from both the White House and Congress is, just keep it out of the press. You know, just don&#8217;t have a flap. As long as you can keep it out of the press, we don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s the, relative to the budget, these are small numbers, these are small people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem with that system is that you end up with this situation that you have in Niger with this ambush and you have four American servicemen killed in what should have just been a training and advising role, and so the question becomes what were they doing there and is it classic mission creep. I think the evidence so far suggests that it is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, if you have people deployed in, you know, a hundred different countries, the truth is that all of those become a possibility. They were always a possibility. The thing in Niger, by the way, could easily just happen under Obama. That has absolutely nothing to do with which person occupies the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, we have a quality military, but shit happens. I mean the reality is that things you don&#8217;t foresee occur when you&#8217;ve got weapons. And I&#8217;m more surprised that these things don&#8217;t happen with some greater frequency, although we may start seeing that this happens now because there are just so many places outside of traditional battle zones, war zones where U.S. forces are deployed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> We have to be really careful about not just where the mission creep goes next and where it intensifies but also how little we&#8217;re going to know about it. This isn&#8217;t really going to be a very good time to rely on official pronouncements of what these missions actually are. Think, for a second, the way in which the military first discussed this ambush of the four Army Special Forces in Niger. First they were just on a training exercise, and now it appears — we reported the Daily Beast that what actually happened was, at some point during this supposed advisory patrol, they get tipped to some senior terror suspect target, and then end up getting waylaid by the locals that they were supposedly meeting for information. We&#8217;re just sort of seeing how that peels back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we have to be really cautious, both as reporters and I think as news consumers, if I can be so bold, to think about what it&#8217;s actually going to mean when we hear “this is a training and advisory mission.” That&#8217;s basically, since Obama frankly, the kind of euphemistic way that these operations are typically described. But, as we can see, they can turn into combat in a flash and we shouldn&#8217;t just sort of accept what the kind of initial descriptions of these things are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> All four of us have written about contractors, and I think, I was looking at Erik Prince now, because I think his access and the allure of subcontracting out a lot of these missions is going to be not lost on the Trump administration that sees the value of business, right? Which believes that private contractors and private business men can do things better than the government&#8217;s own. I think that&#8217;s one thing that we haven&#8217;t right appreciated yet with this administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and Erik Prince publicly is pushing this Afghanistan plan to privatize the war and, you know, I think he secretly wants to be or not so secretly wants to be the viceroy sent over to do that but it&#8217;s, the question remains open on this table, what is he pitching to the Trump Administration that has not yet made it in public. Matthew Cole, what is something people should be looking at to break in the coming weeks or months, a country, an issue, what are you looking at?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Pompeo is out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Mm.

We&#8217;ll leave that for the pages of theintercept.com and not blow it on this show, but you&#8217;re now going to start a race with Spencer and Aram.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> And anybody else.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Well, he&#8217;s beaten me before, so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Spencer Ackerman, thank you very much for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SA:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole, thank you for joining us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Aram Roston, thank you for your first appearance on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AR:\u003c/strong> Thanks a million.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Aram Roston is a reporter with BuzzFeed News. Spencer Ackerman is at The Daily Beast. And Matthew Cole reports for The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, as I mentioned earlier there is a really bizarre and potentially very dangerous chain of events that has been kicked into motion in Saudi Arabia. That country&#8217;s 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, has been leading a political purge, arresting potential rivals and holding them in a luxury hotel as prisoners of sorts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By the way, Salman is one of the primary players in the Saudi bombing of Yemen. Trump has thrown all of his support behind Salman and Aramco Oil and weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, no nuance or hiding anything there. No platitudes as those were offered under President Obama. He&#8217;s cold, out in the open about it all.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then last week, this whole story broke open on to another front as the prime minister of Lebanon abruptly announced his resignation on Saudi television.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Saad Hariri:\u003c/strong> [Speaking Arabic]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Then this weekend, that Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, gave an interview from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he&#8217;s apparently in exile at this point. Whether that exile is self-imposed or Saudi-imposed remains really unclear right now. He says he&#8217;s a free man but honestly it didn&#8217;t look that way in the interview.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Saudis are extremely influential in Lebanon and Hariri himself is a dual citizen of the nations. Lebanon has an unusual system of government that requires the president of the country to be a Maronite Christian, the speaker of the parliament to be a Shiite Muslim and the prime minister to be a Sunni Muslim. The Saudis have long sought to exert serious influence over the prime minister and that definitely has been the case with Saad Hariri.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lebanon&#8217;s most powerful and influential faction, however, is the Hezbollah movement led by Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah is supported by and works in coordination with Iran, so Lebanon is definitely part of the geography of the not-so-proxy wars that the Saudis claim to be waging against Iran, in Yemen, Syria, and elsewhere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Joining me now is Rami Khouri, he is a veteran journalist based in Beirut. He’s now a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut. Rami, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rami Khouri:\u003c/strong> Glad to be with you. Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is going on here?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Well this is quite an extraordinary phenomenon that we have. It&#8217;s like a Turkish soap opera inside a Byzantine drama inside a Persian poem, all wrapped up in Lebanese politics. It&#8217;s just extraordinary, we&#8217;ve never experienced anything like this in the Middle East or the Arab world, with so many interlocking dynamics, many of them based on military might.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is really mostly about Saudi Arabia. The Lebanese side, the Qatari situation, the Yemeni situation, Iraq, Iran, these are all elements in this drama, but the central theme is the transition inside Saudi Arabia as it essentially does two things. You have a transition to a new leadership, which is now cemented, anchored in one person, Mohammad Bin Salman, and Saudi Arabia has become like Egypt, like Muammer Gaddafi in Libya, like Saddam Hussein, all power — economic, political, military, social, media, religious — all power is in the hands of one man. He happens to be a young, inexperienced, rather dynamic young man, but he&#8217;s got all the power in the country and he&#8217;s showing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The second thing that&#8217;s happening is that Saudi Arabia has reached the high watermark now of its attempts which have been going on for about a year and a half, two years, to show the world and its own people that it really has muscle: political coercion, military, economic, that it has power that it can use and it will use that power to defend itself against what it sees as threats to its national well-being. Those two things are happening simultaneously in Saudi Arabia, they&#8217;ve completely overturned within the last really six, nine months all the foundational principles that have defined Saudi Arabia&#8217;s life for about the last 100 years or so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, and now Lebanon is just one little peg in this situation where the Saudis — having failed with their siege of Qatar, having failed with their war in Yemen, having failed in trying to overthrow the Syrian president, and in one or two other proxy battles where they failed in the region — they&#8217;re now trying to put pressure on Lebanon so they can have any win, so they can be seen to be successful tough guys taking care of their people and the whole Gulf region, as they see it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s a summary really, I think, of what&#8217;s going on. And it&#8217;s dangerous, it&#8217;s reckless, it&#8217;s really frightening for people around the region. If you see what&#8217;s happened in Yemen in the last three years, two and a half years, with this extraordinary mass starvation and cholera, and misery, this is just a sign of what may happen in other Arab countries.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now to what degree does this have to do with Saudi Arabia and Iran? Of course in the case of Yemen, the Saudis are trying to convince the world that the Houthis equal Iran. In Lebanon, the Saudi line is that Hezbollah is nothing more than an extension of the Iranian regime, but this issue of Iran, Hezbollah and Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> It is and it isn&#8217;t about Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis say it is about Iran because they see Iran under the Islamic revolutionary leadership that&#8217;s there. They see it as a hegemonic, predatory, dangerous and terroristic threat to all the Arab world. They see it closing in on them, they see it surrounding them, they see it having links with people all over the region, and it scares the daylight out of them, and therefore their central foreign policy objective right now seems to be a need to push back, roll back the Iranian threat all around the Middle East.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My feeling is that this is extremely superficial that there is no real battle between Iran and the Arab world in terms of hegemonic control of the region. The Iranians are mostly Shiite and they&#8217;re Persian, they&#8217;re Iranian, they&#8217;re not Arab, they&#8217;re not mostly Sunni, there&#8217;s no way that the Iranians or the Turks who have often been put in this position of being accused of wanting to have had hegemonic ambitions in the region, there&#8217;s no way that Iran can take charge or be the superpower of the Arab world. It just wouldn&#8217;t happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the Saudis are frightened. They really fear that the changes taking place in the Arab world, that have been taking place for the last six or seven years are an existential threat to their kind of life, to their government system, to their political mechanisms and to their very future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think they&#8217;re completely mistaken. I think the real issue is they feel that they are going to be forced to change, that they cannot maintain their style of top-heavy, autocratic, welfare state governance that gives their people most of what they need at the material level — schooling, medical care, housing, et cetera — but that&#8217;s about all they have. They don&#8217;t have cultural freedom. They don&#8217;t have political participation. They don&#8217;t have social vitality. They don&#8217;t have any kind of participation or accountability in governance. And this is what the Saudis and the Emiratis are desperately trying to stop.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What they see happening around them is a series of events, all of which they link to Iran, which I think is not the case, but they see Muslim Brotherhood groups winning elections, peaceful, free elections, like in Egypt and other places. They see civic activism all over the region, they see groups of citizens in Arab countries freely expressing themselves, organizing, challenging political autocracy, challenging the existing prevailing political and economic order. They see American governments and foreign governments engaging with Iran, making deals with Iran. They see open media like Al Jazeera and many others that have copied Jazeera, they see all of these things and that scares the daylights out of them, because they don&#8217;t want any of that stuff to come to them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, they&#8217;ve chosen Iran and more recently Jazeera and Qatar, they&#8217;ve chosen them as kind of proxies for these threats that they see, but these threats I think are really not totally a mirage, but they&#8217;re really exaggerated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But what&#8217;s going on with this resignation of Saad Hariri? On November 4, there was this abrupt resignation, which took place on a Saudi television station. Then, Hariri is in Riyadh, in his home, and he is a dual citizen of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, and he does this totally strange interview with a well-known anchor from a television network in Lebanon that he owns, flies her to Riyadh, she does this interview with him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SH:\u003c/strong> [dubbed in English] I submitted my resignation. I know it&#8217;s not a normal process for a prime minister, but I had to take some security measures to return back safe and sound.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is going on? Why would he be in Saudi Arabia? What&#8217;s behind the resignation? What do the Saudis get out of this? I mean I really don&#8217;t get what&#8217;s happening there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> Everybody in the Arab world right now, especially in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, is asking the same question. And I think only one person knows the answer, and that&#8217;s Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and maybe Hariri knows the answer, but Hariri probably doesn&#8217;t know all the answers. The general assumption, by people who know Lebanon and Saudi Arabia well and have studied the situation, and I share this assumption: is that the Saudis, desperate for any kind of progress, are trying in any way they can to blunt the power and political presence of Hezbollah inside Lebanon, in the Lebanese government. Because they&#8217;re part of the government, they&#8217;re in the cabinet, they&#8217;re in the parliament. The force of Hezbollah is so strong now, it&#8217;s so powerful that the Saudis are frightened of it because they accuse it of being involved in regional events like helping arm the Houthis with advanced missiles and train them and other people around the region. Now, whether that&#8217;s true or not, we&#8217;ll find out in due course, but they see Hezbollah as a real, serious threat to them and Hezbollah is a very close strategic ally of Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think what the Saudis are trying to do is create chaos in Lebanon by shaking up the coalition that exists, smashing that coalition, creating tension in the country that would should shake the country at its foundations, maybe if you hit the economy which is the most vulnerable, the value of the Lebanese pound would collapse and this will create mass suffering in Lebanon. And they think that by doing that they might then force the Lebanese to clamp down on Hezbollah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If this is actually what they&#8217;re trying to do, then they&#8217;re more amateurish than even they have made themselves appear to be in the last year or so. Because this is totally not going to happen. Many people have tried to do this, including the mighty United States, with its sanctions and its threats and all of the things that it does. Hezbollah has many things that it does. Some are acceptable globally, some are not acceptable. It has a lot of enemies; it has many more friends. It&#8217;s a controversial group. But the reality is that they are the most powerful group in Lebanon. They may be the most the single most powerful political organization in the entire Arab world — possibly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They have proven this many ways, many times and they are not going to be thrown out of their current position by these kinds of threats from Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The interesting thing is that what happened when the Saudis put this pressure on Lebanon, they also advise their Saudi nationals to leave Lebanon, as did four other Gulf Cooperation countries: Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, et cetera. They all told their nationals to leave Lebanon. Suddenly people in Beirut I&#8217;ve been talking to in the last few days are scared, that, &#8220;Oh my gosh, there&#8217;s going to be a war, there&#8217;s going to be a war!&#8221; And people said, &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to attack us? The Israelis, or the Americans, or the Saudis, or maybe all of them?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there was real panic in Lebanon for a few hours, until the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, spoke out. The president of Lebanon Michel Aoun, a Christian who&#8217;s quite a powerful, you know, focused, resolute figure, he spoke out. So, the Lebanese calmed down.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then when Hariri spoke, it started to lessen the fear and the concerns, because Hariri spoke about coming back to Beirut and maybe negotiating and possibly coming to a new agreement by which Hezbollah and the rest of the Lebanese government work together. So, the interview that Hariri gave was quite psychedelic. I mean, I watched it carefully and it was like a puppet was there, not him. He didn&#8217;t look like himself, he didn&#8217;t act like himself, he didn&#8217;t talk like himself, he clearly was not in his normal element.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, why this is? We don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s just an incredible amount of speculation going on. A lot of it we can put into a pattern of how the Saudis have acted recently in the region. This is primarily about Saudi Arabia and its frenzied hysterical attempt to have a win in the region where it shows that it&#8217;s actually been able to blunt the power of the Iranians and push back the wave of Shiite militarism all around the region. That strikes me as the central dynamic that we need to keep to keep, to keep our eye on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why, now, I&#8217;ve heard that joke in Beirut that Saudi Arabia is ready to fight Iran to the last Lebanese.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> You know, this is proxy wars taken to their extreme, where you get Hezbollah as a proxy of Iran, they see it, and then they might get other Lebanese to try to fight, they get their proxies to fight another proxy. And, so, we, you know, all of this is speculation right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The great tragic irony that confirms the amateurism of Saudi foreign policy today in the region, is that we&#8217;ve seen the Saudis now lead two campaigns against two smaller countries: one was Qatar, the boycott about, what, four months ago or so? And the other was Lebanon.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, in both cases, they expected that their show, their mighty show of force and threats would immediately cause Qatar to cave in and accept whatever the Saudis wanted from them and they expected the Lebanese to do the same. What happened in both cases is exactly the opposite, that the Qataris all rallied around their leader, they all said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to hold our ground. We&#8217;ve got to work on being self-sufficient. We&#8217;ve got to improve links with Turkey, and Iran, and Brazil, and India, and everybody else who will help us, and maintain our sovereignty above all else.&#8221; And they have done that so far and they weathered the storm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lebanese did exactly the same — they all rallied around Hariri. There was a Beirut marathon yesterday and people were running around with pictures of Hariri, saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re running for you.&#8221; So, the Saudis have shown a great capacity to bring about exactly the opposite of their intended aim when they carry out foreign policy moves in the region. They don&#8217;t, they just don&#8217;t know how to do it. They don&#8217;t have any experience in statecraft around the region and they&#8217;re showing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The sense that I had under the Obama administration for eight years is that the Saudis were playing Washington pretty masterfully by serving essentially as the eyes and ears of the CIA, and, at times the U.S. military, and really kind of manipulating the American agenda particularly as it related to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, when Trump comes into power, you now have almost this dumbing down of international relations and it seems to me that, you know, Trump has been sending these messages to the Saudis on Twitter and in his speeches and we went over and grabbed that glowing orb with everyone. When this crackdown started happening, when the crown prince starts locking up all these other princes, when mysterious deaths start occurring, Trump says, &#8220;Oh, the Saudis know what they&#8217;re doing and I trust them.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How much of Trump&#8217;s posture and what he says and the way he carries himself empowers or emboldens the Saudis to make these kinds of overt moves?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> The Trump position explicitly approves of what the Saudis are doing and gives them enormous confidence to keep going in this direction. That&#8217;s what happened when he first went there for his first trip overseas. He, and Sisi, the tyrant of Egypt, the president of Egypt, when Sisi, and Trump, and the Saudi leadership all got together around the orb, it was a signal of where American policy was in the region.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we now know very clearly that the basic positions that the Americans, the Israelis and the Saudi leadership agree on are very simple: Keep Israel&#8217;s superiority militarily above everybody else&#8217;s in the region, fight ISIS, and other terror groups, push back Iran, keep our autocrats in power and strengthen them as needed, and do all this while making huge deals that bring jobs and income and exports to American companies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Those five basic principles are the foundation, now the cornerstones, of American foreign policy in the region. And with the ascendancy of Mohammad bin Salman to the crown prince&#8217;s position and his, now, in the last ten days, bringing all power, literally all power in the kingdom into his hands, what we have going on in the region is a third phase of what I call, the capture of governance systems in Arab countries by autocratic or military individuals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It started with Nasser in the 1950s in Egypt, then in the 70s went to the Syria with, you know, Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and Assad in Syria, Gadhafi in Yemen, and a bunch of others. And now this is the third phase, where this is the first time we have a single person, it&#8217;s not even a family, it&#8217;s just one person right now, who has all these leavers of power in his hands, who&#8217;s crushing his opposition domestically quite fiercely, who is directly supported by the United States, and who is using his military power around the region in Yemen and other places anyway that he wants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is the first monarchy that has adopted the Sisi formula of one-man-rule-for-life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to get your take on Syria. I think this is a war where there certainly are no good guys in the sense of organized armed violence. There are varying degrees of bad actors there. You have major world powers like the United States and Russia both killing a tremendous number of people. ISIS seems to be fractured and in tatters in parts of Syria and Iraq, but it&#8217;s unclear what a unified Syria looks like going forward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Based on your analysis and also your geographic proximity to Syria, being based out of Beirut and monitoring the situation very closely as you do, is there any peaceful end to all of this or any of this in Syria in your view?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> The simple answer is yes, there could be a peaceful end with Bashar Assad and his supporters, Hezbollah, Iran, the Russians and others, dominating Syria or at least those parts of Syria that they still control, that seems to be happening now. It&#8217;s still early days, but they are gradually regaining control over much of the country as ISIS is being defeated. The other rebels, Islamists and secular ones are being slowly cornered to one or two parts of the country, so you could possibly see a resolution of the actual fighting by a combination of exhaustion, dominance by the pro-government, pro-Assad forces and strong international support for an end to fighting, some kind of peaceful arrangement that allows the, I think, the six million Syrian refugees and displaced people to go back to their homes. So yes, you could see that, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s going to be a governance system and an economic order that the majority of Syrians can agree on. There&#8217;s no sign that they&#8217;ll be any change under the current Assad regime in Syria of they mechanisms of decision-making. In other words, they will continue to be top-heavy and autocratic and ordinary people really won&#8217;t have a say. And this is a tragedy as well, because it means all this fighting and killing and dying and suffering would have been for nothing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, this is a sign that Arab sovereignty and Arab statehood and Syria have both been totally relinquished, totally lost. And this is a dramatic, more dramatic sign than in other places, but the same kind of sign of the essential failure or at least serious fragility of both statehood and sovereignty in most Arab countries. And there has to be some kind of reconfiguration of how power is exercised and how states are defined and how policies are made in which the ordinary citizens have a say, in which the consent of the governed is somehow implemented.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Tunisia is trying it now, it&#8217;s the only one to make the breakthrough, so we hope it will succeed in and others will follow. But until that happens, we&#8217;re going to continue living in an Arab world with huge stresses, distortions, inequities, exploitation with all the foreign interventions, military and otherwise, that come with it. So, it&#8217;s very depressing and the answer is very simple — until the ordinary Arab citizens have some kind of say in how their countries are organized and run, you&#8217;re going to continue to have autocratic leadership, which is going to lead to the kind of problems that we&#8217;ve suffered for the last 60 years or so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re going to leave it there. Rami Khouri, thank you very much for your analysis and your expertise on all of this. Thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RK:\u003c/strong> My pleasure. Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Rami Khouri is a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University in Beirut.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Donald Trump has openly said that he despises many media organizations. He&#8217;s whimsically opined on how he&#8217;d like to see some news organizations shut down and he&#8217;s actively encouraged hostility toward reporters, including in front of large crowds. Trump&#8217;s mantra of ‘fake news, fake news, fake news” has caught on among his supporters and it&#8217;s really created what feels like a major divide in the perception of reality in the United States and it can be totally crazy-making, particularly when it&#8217;s absolutely clear, no two ways of looking, at it that Trump is lying. At times, it reminds me of that shady lawyer Nathan Thurm from the old Saturday Night Live sketches about 60 Minutes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mike Wallace (Henry Shearer):\u003c/strong> We saw your people making pirate Minkman schnozes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nathan Thurm (Martin Short):\u003c/strong> I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. It&#8217;s so funny that you say that. We don&#8217;t make schnozes. We make semiconductors for a very reputable computer company, what&#8217;s wrong with that? Is there something wrong with that? Why is that suddenly wrong to do? I don&#8217;t understand that. Why are you pointing the finger at other people all the time, why don&#8217;t you point it at yourself?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Trump is certainly no friend of a free press, and this week he wrapped up his Asia tour by meeting with his great new friend Rodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> We had a great relationship, this has been very successful. We have many meetings today with many other leaders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When Duterte kicked the press out of a meeting that he had with Donald Trump, Duterte joked that journalists are spies. And Trump laughed. But it&#8217;s not funny — at all. More than 170 journalists have been killed in the Philippines since 1986. And last year, the summer of 2016, Duterte responded to the murder of a journalist in Manila by saying quote —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rodrigo Duterte:\u003c/strong> Just because you are a journalist, you are not exempted from assassination if you are a son of a bitch!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Duterte, by the way, has also bragged that he&#8217;s personally murdered people. But Trump has repeatedly praised Duterte, including for how the Philippine strongman has waged his so-called war on drugs, by encouraging mob killings and extrajudicial executions. So no — nothing is funny about Duterte joking about journalists being spies and it&#8217;s shameful that Trump cackled away.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Trump actually bragged about how Duterte rolled out a literal red carpet, very fitting, a red carpet, for Trump to trot down for his big welcome. Trump told reporters that Duterte gave him a, &#8220;red carpet like I think probably nobody has ever received.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Announcer:\u003c/strong> His excellency, Donald Trump, President of the United States of America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the music that played for Trump&#8217;s Philippines catwalk was just plain creepy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music plays.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Oh, and according to Duterte&#8217;s spokesman, there was no discussion of human rights abuses while Trump was talking with Duterte. As Trump was finishing his love fest with Duterte, back in the U.S. a story broke about an organization that has been embraced in a very contradictory and baffling way by Trump, attorney general Jeff Sessions, CIA director Mike Pompeo, I&#8217;m talking about WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the campaign trail, Trump regularly praised WikiLeaks. But then after winning the White House, Trump&#8217;s Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his CIA director basically said Julian Assange is a major public enemy that needs to be taken down.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, here&#8217;s the latest: on Monday, the Atlantic published a story based on leaked transcripts of the private direct message, or DM, history between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump, Jr. Soon after that story went online, Don Jr. posted screenshots of the entire chat history and alleged that some of the context had been left out or that the contents of the DM&#8217;s had been misportrayed, and he said that the leaking of it was political given its timing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In any case, those DMs are now available for anyone to see. What these messages clearly show is that WikiLeaks made offers to help the Trump campaign, shared private information about a website that appeared to be focused on Trump&#8217;s alleged connections to Vladimir Putin in Russia, WikiLeaks suggested that the campaign leak Trump&#8217;s tax returns to WikiLeaks to publish. The WikiLeaks account also suggested to Don Jr. that should Trump lose, he should not concede and instead focus intensely on &#8220;challenging the media and other types of rigging that occurred.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Oh, and Assange also suggested that should Trump win, he should insist that the Australian Government name Assange as its ambassador to the United States. Now, this week on Tuesday after this DM story started to spread, Julian Assange tweeted from his personal account, &#8220;Dear Donald Trump, Jr., our offer of being ambassador to the U.S. still stands, I could open a hotel-style embassy in DC with luxury immunity suites for whistleblowers. The public will get a turbocharged flow of intel about the latest CIA plots to undermine democracy.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In these direct messages, which we understand spanned from September 2016 to possibly July 2017, Don Jr. responds infrequently, a total of three times according to him. He did post a link provided to him by WikiLeaks in these direct messages and the timing of this correspondence does appear to line up with an uptick in Trump citing WikiLeaks in connection with the DNC e-mails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Regarding the pitch to leak Trump&#8217;s tax returns to WikiLeaks, the account told Don Jr., &#8220;If we publish them, it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality. That means that the vast amount of stuff that we&#8217;re publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact because it won&#8217;t be perceived as coming from a pro-Trump, pro-Russia source which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now I personally believe that a lot of the media coverage of WikiLeaks over the past year plus has been sloppy, inaccurate, much of it relies on taking unproven allegations or innocuous bits of information and passing them off as facts to craft a particular narrative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>WikiLeaks has been the publisher of some of the most vital national security leaks of the modern era, but when I read these DMs with Don Jr., I cannot see any reasonable defense for Assange or WikiLeaks other than self-interest combined with, frankly, an understandable opposition to the policies of Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state regarding WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now there&#8217;s another angle here, which is the overwhelming dominant narrative you&#8217;ll find in the U.S. media right now: Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are working for Putin and the KGB, and that&#8217;s why all of this happened. The problem is there&#8217;s just not actual evidence right now to back that up, at least not any that meets basic journalistic standards. Now, in a move that&#8217;s bound to attract a lot of haters, joining me right now to discuss this is my colleague and fellow Intercept co-founder, Glenn Greenwald.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Glenn, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Glenn Greenwald\u003c/strong>: It&#8217;s great to be back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Before we get into all the details, your broad response to the way that the story is being reported and also what it actually tells us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Well, it resembles every other similar report, which is the minute it comes out for two hours, journalists on Twitter mindlessly claim it&#8217;s a huge story. They say “whoa” and “wow” and “boom,” with no attempt to analyze what the actual implications are. And the only person I saw doing that was Marcy Wheeler, who, I think, pointed out very astutely, that on the key question of collusion, it&#8217;s actually exculpatory for Trump Jr., because it makes clear that he had no idea what the WikiLeaks leak was going to be when everyone was previewing it and talking about it like Roger Stone, he asked Assange, &#8220;What is this that everyone&#8217;s talking about?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s interesting in that it shows that Trump Jr. is willing to take help from anywhere, including WikiLeaks, which I don&#8217;t think is surprising. It shows WikiLeaks trying to leverage its relationship to the Trump campaign for its own benefit, which I also don&#8217;t consider to be surprising. But in terms of like the collusion issue, it has nothing to say other than the fact that Trump Jr. didn&#8217;t know what these WikiLeaks documents were going to be until WikiLeaks published them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Right and a lot of the press coverage of this is taking for granted the idea that Julian Assange and Wikileaks is like an extension of the KGB or of the Kremlin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Right, I mean, if you assume that Vladimir Putin is Julian Assange&#8217;s boss and directs WikiLeaks, then maybe some of this has more meaning. But for those of us in the world where evidence and rationality reigns supreme, there&#8217;s zero evidence that that is even remotely true, that WikiLeaks is some kind of an arm of the Russian government and therefore in terms of evidence it doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere in terms of proving collusion between Trump and the Russians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> OK, let&#8217;s set aside that question for a second. Now, you and I both have had communications with Julian Assange over a period of years. I&#8217;ve been to see him in the embassy. We had him on for an entire show earlier in this season. I really, for the life of me, do not understand at this point what his agenda is or what his mission is. It just seems nuts to me the way that Julian is conducting himself right now. And these direct messages, I read them and I say, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Yo Gotti “Down in the DM”]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Why are you communicating with Donald Trump Jr., and overtly saying, &#8220;Hey these things we could do could help you guys out,” and helping them sort of strategize? To me it&#8217;s not about collusion with Russia or something. Like, why on earth is Julian Assange or WikiLeaks engaging with an overtly fascist political campaign in what appears to be an effort to help them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> I can only speculate about Julian&#8217;s motives. I&#8217;m not his spokesperson. I&#8217;m not WikiLeaks&#8217; spokesperson. I&#8217;ve never talked to drawing about these questions, the ones that you just raised. But I think there&#8217;s a couple of things going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, on the one hand, you have Julian who cares a lot about his own personal situation namely trying to get out of the Ecuadorian embassy without getting arrested and spending lots of time in prison. I think he perceives that a positive relationship with the Trumps will help him in that quest to improve his own circumstance, so I think there&#8217;s a lot of that going on. I think that there&#8217;s a lot of just desire for attention going on. So, if you&#8217;re WikiLeaks and you&#8217;re publishing these emails and you can get Donald Trump himself to constantly promote them, that elevates the importance of WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I think that finally what you see is that even in these last messages, where you hear Assange saying to Trump Jr., &#8216;When your father loses, don&#8217;t have him concede, call the election rig.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think Julian expects the Trumps to win, I think he&#8217;s hoping to just keep things chaotic, which, remember, is a major part of WikiLeaks&#8217; or certainly Assange&#8217;s world view, which is that the United States is a hegemonic power that does evil in the world, and so when you throw sand in its gears and make it more difficult for it to function properly as a hegemonic power, you&#8217;re actually achieving something good.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think there&#8217;s a lot of mixed motives going on there, that have to do with Assange himself, with a desire for attention for WikiLeaks, and then also just the broader philosophy and world view that I think Julian and, to a lesser extent, WikiLeaks have embraced quite a long time ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;ll play here an excerpt from our conversation with Julian Assange where I asked him what it was like watching Trump cite WikiLeaks during the course of the campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> This Wikileaks is like a treasure trove.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean, just on a personal level, Julian, like what, what was it like to see Trump citing WikiLeaks during the course of his campaign in the way that he did?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JA:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean, whenever a high-profile person cites our material, especially when a big audience is watching, we think, &#8220;Great, more people are going to read it.&#8221; From that perspective, we thought, &#8220;Well, this is great. Donald Trump is marketing our material. People are going to read it.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We thought Hillary Clinton was going to win, we thought our publications were actually going to create a very infuriated Hillary Clinton on the other end that we would have to deal, so it&#8217;s a kind, far from that publishing cycle being one of self-interest, it was one of, far as we saw, one of self-sacrifice, because we were infuriating what everyone perceived would be the next executive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If, if we had wanted to kind of do things for me, we would&#8217;ve praised Hillary Clinton, and published stuff about her opponent, because everyone was predicting Hillary Clinton would win, including me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> I think it&#8217;s fair to assume that Julian thought what everybody thought, what like, the geniuses of the New York Times, like Nate Cohen&#8217;s data models were showing, that it was overwhelmingly likely that Hillary Clinton not Donald Trump was going to win. And so, I do think it&#8217;s hard to say, &#8220;Well, what Julian was up to was helping Trump win.&#8221; Pretty much everybody thought that was impossible. I think it&#8217;s much more persuasive that he thought that by gaining support among Trump&#8217;s followers, by ingratiating himself with the Trumps by getting more attention and elevating the importance of WikiLeaks, that he was helping himself. And then once Trump won, then I do think he thought, &#8220;Wow this is a real opportunity for me now, given that the president of the United States is somebody has been running around for the last three months saying, &#8216;I love WikiLeaks&#8217; to use that to protect my own situation.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s clearly a major part of the motive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Now, this just came out. This just came out. WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks. [Cheering.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, Mike Pompeo, CIA director, one of his first public pronouncements was saying:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mike Pompeo: It&#8217;s time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is: a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Jeff Sessions has said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeff Sessions:\u003c/strong> So, yes it is a priority. We&#8217;ve already begun to step up efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean this would be an odd thank you gift for Julian Assange, if everything that all of these journalists are extrapolating from these direct messages with Donald Trump Jr., is true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Yeah, I mean look, you know, Donald Trump himself has never shown a molecule of ethical conduct or loyalty to anyone but himself in his entire life, so there&#8217;s zero reason to think he would intervene to defend WikiLeaks after getting from WikiLeaks what he wanted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there are, you know, most factions inside the U.S. government: the CIA, the FBI, the entire Republican Party that have hated WikiLeaks for many years and regarded them as a serious enemy of the United States, wanting to kill them or imprison Julian Assange forever. They clearly still want to do that. And so, the idea that Donald Trump is going to stand up to all of those factions in order to protect Julian Assange, I think is a pipe dream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think the posture of the U.S. government very much is that regardless of what Assange might have done to help Trump get elected, they want to get their hands on WikiLeaks, and Assange specifically, and put him into prison for a really long time. And I think that if he ever leaves the Ecuadorian embassy in London, that&#8217;s by far the most likely outcome still.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, in the few moments we have left, Glenn, I want to get your comment on this: the Russian television network that is state funded in Russia, Russia Today, says that it has complied with an order from the U.S. Department of Justice that it has to register as a foreign agent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, of course, RT has been discussed in front of Congress, it&#8217;s regularly talked about on MSNBC, there&#8217;s these groups that have put out sort of a hit list of every journalist, thinker, academic in the Western world that has voluntarily appeared on RT.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Joe Scarborough:\u003c/strong> This would be like Russia being able to control Walter Cronkite&#8217;s broadcast, you know, in the late 60s, early 70s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The largest press freedom organization in the United States, the Committee to Protect Journalists, which itself I&#8217;ve gone to battle with them because they have defended the U.S. government in cases where I thought it was wrong, when the U.S. government was attacking journalists, they have said that this is a threat to the First Amendment. And you&#8217;ve weighed in saying that you agree with that. How is it that a Russian state media outlet, operating in the United States, registering as a foreign agent, how does that harm the First Amendment?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Well, because it gives the government regulatory power over directing the conduct of media outlets. There are all kinds of media outlets that operate in the United States that are funded by or to some extent governed by foreign governments, whether it be the BBC or Saudi outlets, there&#8217;s an endless number of them, public broadcasters and the like, and yet none of them are being required to register as foreign agents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the concern is twofold: One is that it gives the U.S. government control over kind of picking and choosing which media outlets it wants to subject to this regulatory constraint, and then on the other hand it also incentivizes and justifies other countries including the Russians to then turn around reciprocally and start doing it to U.S. media outlets that function in their countries, which is almost inevitable and likely to occur.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, I think if you&#8217;re the Committee to Protect Journalists, you want, the government, all governments, to stay as far away as possible when picking and choosing which media outlets it dislikes and which ones they&#8217;re going to force to register and disclose, because it&#8217;s very dangerous that they could abuse that power themselves and that it will set a precedent where other governments in other countries will start doing that as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn Greenwald thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>GG:\u003c/strong> Thanks for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Glenn Greenwald is my fellow co-founder of The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> After last week&#8217;s election, Democratic wins in Virginia were interpreted by many within the party, as well as its supporters, as evidence that Donald Trump&#8217;s unpopularity was costing Republicans at the polls. We&#8217;ll see if that bears out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Democrats won the governor&#8217;s race and they also gained a foothold in the Virginia legislature. Before the election, Republicans held 66 of the 100 seats in the House of Delegates. After the election Democrats, secured 49 seats and a few more races have yet to be settled. Just one more seat for the Democrats would force a power-sharing agreement with the Republicans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now maybe Virginia is a barometer for what&#8217;s in store in the 2018 midterm elections.

We don&#8217;t know yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But we do know is that the Republican Party&#8217;s playbook has long included an intense focus on down-ballot races and this could be a spark for the Democrats to start competing with them at their own game.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss all of this, I&#8217;m joined by two newly elected Virginia House delegates: Elizabeth Guzman will now serve as the delegate for Virginia&#8217;s 31st district, she&#8217;s an immigrant from Peru, a social worker and a public servant.

Stewart took 7,500 criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Corey Stewart:\u003c/strong> People who are here illegally are illegal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Many times I felt like a criminal because, they, he would make me feel that way just because of the way I look. Having to carry my passport with me to prove that I am documented alien here in Prince William County. So, I decided to run for office because I wanted my children to be raised in environment where they are respected, where they are, they feel like they are Americans. I want more children who look like me to run for office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For me to get there, I was inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders when he told me that if we wanted to make a difference, we need to consider to run for office because decisions are not only taken at the federal level, also at the local level and the state level, so when he was saying that I just had immediately these flashbacks about my life as a minority in Prince William County.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Lee Carter, first of all, congratulations on your victory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC:\u003c/strong> Thank you so much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You have, also, an interesting story as to how you decided to seek political office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so, I served five years on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from 2006 to 2011, deployed twice with the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, went to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010. You know I decided to run for office after an injury on the job in the summer of 2015, long after I got out of the Marin Corps, but I was installing a lighting control panel and I got shocked and I blew my back out pulling away from that panel, and I could barely walk for about two and a half, three months. You know I couldn&#8217;t walk more than about fifty feet at a stretch, and I just got shuffled around from doctor to doctor on worker&#8217;s comp and none of them really wanted to address the actual problem, they just wanted to give me pain pills and get me out the door.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But finally, I decided to pay out of pocket for a specialist to figure out what the problem was and he was able to get me back on my feet fairly quickly. And when I was able to get back to work, I called my boss and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go, put me back to work.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;We have work, but we don&#8217;t have any for you. Because our customer is not comfortable with you on their job site.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s what sort of pushed me into politics, you know? There was this rage that I put my body on the line to make this company rich and when I finally got hurt, you know, when that dangerous job caught up to me, they just threw me under the bus. So, I decided I was going to step forward and run for office and fix this. Because there&#8217;s a very common phrase in the construction industry that goes, &#8220;If you fall off a ladder you&#8217;re fired before you hit the ground.&#8221; Most construction workers have heard that and you know they&#8217;ve heard it, not as a joke, as a threat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, you know, I decided to step forward and run for office and make sure that what happened to me didn&#8217;t happen to thousands of other Virginians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Talk about the struggles you had in fighting both the Republicans and the institutional Democratic Party in Virginia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC\u003c/strong>: Yeah, we were able to put together a coalition of groups, you know we had the Democratic Socialists of America, we also had the anti-gerrymandering group, Let America Vote, which was founded by former Congressman Jason Kander. We had, you know, the support of the Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-choice Virginia and the Virginia AFL-CIO and sister district and all these sort of women&#8217;s march type groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we had the support of the base of the Democratic Party, and also, you know, the Democratic Socialists of America and we put that coalition together sort of in defiance of Virginia&#8217;s Democratic Party leadership.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The leadership here certainly wanted a lot of minute to minute reports on exactly what was happening in the campaign that I wasn&#8217;t comfortable providing. They wanted some editorial control over my message that I wasn&#8217;t comfortable providing. So, I decided, you know what? I&#8217;ve got the manpower to do this. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and do this and I&#8217;m going to do it my way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the mailers that my opponent sent out, he actually sent out to 11,000 homes, a mailer that had Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-Tung and Lee Carter&#8217;s face on them, all the text on it talked about my health care policy, because, you know, if there&#8217;s one thing that people remember Stalin for, it&#8217;s the health care.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC:\u003c/strong> But clearly that sort of 1950s, 1960s, you can&#8217;t go to the left or they&#8217;re going to call you a commie type of common knowledge in politics doesn&#8217;t hold true anymore.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>U.S. Armed Forces Video:\u003c/strong> If a person defends the activities of the communist nations while consistently attacking the domestic and foreign policy of the United States, she may be a communist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Elizabeth Guzman, you came to the United States from Peru as a single mother. What role did the rise or the victory of Donald Trump play in your decision to seek office?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> It was very important to me, I was like, he&#8217;s attacking the Latino know community all the time and I&#8217;m like bring it on, you are just making me more famous. And my opponent was using Trump-like messaging, attacking me since August. He sent three negative pieces relating me as a person who wanted to provide driver&#8217;s license to illegal aliens so they could vote for me, so they could buy guns, so they were MS-13 members.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What he wants to do is to distract that community from the issues. So, I never responded to those attacks, I decided just to bring my supporters back to the issues. There were people in my district that care about increasing the minimum to a living wage. There were people who were dying to have early childhood education programs that we don&#8217;t have. There were people who care about transportation issues and those were more important for me. I wanted to make this fight not just a fight in between the immigrants versus the veterans, because my opponent is a veteran and I thank him for his service, but I wanted to make it about a campaign that would advocate for all hardworking Virginians, regardless of their race, regardless of their immigration status, regardless of their sexual orientation. I wanted to be the voice from all those people who sacrificed so many things just to put food on the table.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now Lee, you, of course are at the beginning of your political career and it seems to me like there&#8217;s this bifurcation within the Democratic Party right now where you have the kind of more corporate, elitist, old school Democratic Party headed by the Clintons and their supporters. And then you kind of have everyone else who seems to want the Democratic Party to move in a different direction, more to the left and more in sync with the visions of the most popular political figure in the country right now, Bernie Sanders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What&#8217;s your analysis, Lee, of the state of the Democratic Party?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC:\u003c/strong> This is something that&#8217;s happening on both sides of the aisle. 2008 saw a massive collapse of the global economy on a scale that we hadn&#8217;t seen since the Great Depression. The fact that we never really fixed the global economy after 2008 has built up the simmering discontent with politics as usual on both sides.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, you have politicians particularly within the Democratic Party because Barack Obama was the president at the time, who, for the last eight years have spent the entire time saying, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re in a recovery, things are going great, we don&#8217;t need to change anything about us, the problem is the Republicans.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then the Republicans were pointing to the actual problems with the recovery and the fact that prior to 2008, we had millions of people who had a single full-time job that was able to pay the bills and now they&#8217;re having to work, you know, two and three precarious jobs to get most of the same amount of money as they had before and they&#8217;re saying, you know, the economy is not recovering, it&#8217;s still in the tank and the problem is the Democrats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, so the center of American politics in that environment is really not holding anymore. If you look at the polling, you know, obviously that the most unpopular thing in American politics is president Trump, but the second most unpopular thing in American politics is the Democratic Party. So, the Democratic Party, right now, the leadership certainly seems to think that just by tying all acted Republicans throughout the country to Donald Trump, they can see electoral success. And in the short term that very well may work, but unless we actually clean our own house and recognize that the recovery that we have overseen since 2008 has been incomplete, that we never addressed the structural problems of America&#8217;s economy, that there are people who are being left behind, if we don&#8217;t address those problems within our own party and become the kind of party that fully embraces the working class and the health and welfare of 98 percent of people, once Donald Trump is gone, we&#8217;re going to go through the floor, because we won&#8217;t have that crutch anymore.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, Donald Trump is not going to be around forever, and once he&#8217;s gone, if we haven&#8217;t fixed our own problems, we are in a lot of trouble.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Elizabeth, the Democrats do not have a great record on immigration, in fact Barack Obama, in many immigrant rights circles, was known as the “Deporter-in-Chief,” and you have Donald Trump taking up the mantle of policies that harm immigrant communities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How should this country deal with the issue of undocumented immigration to the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Immigration reform is a federal issue, it&#8217;s not something that we can fix at the state level — I wish we could, but we can&#8217;t. But one of the things as an immigrant myself, I think that I represent the people that come to this country, looking for opportunities. Many times we hear in the news, we listen to the news, we watch on TV, immigrants equals criminals. And that&#8217;s not the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Many people who come to this country, come leaving behind their homes, their families their culture, their food, many professionals come to this country just to start over from scratch — even people graduated from college come and take these minimum-wage jobs or construction jobs just because they see America as a land of opportunities, as a place where they can provide reliable education to their children.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In their minds it&#8217;s not about harming the country, so I had to have these conversations with people from the Republican supporters at the doors and also with Democrats as well. My job was to educate them and tell them, &#8220;Listen, this is what we do when we come here.&#8221; And I think that I represent the American Dream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As far as the immigration, I think that the country needs to take responsibility of allowing these people to come to this country and being here, because if they get here it&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t have systems in place that could prevent from them to come in and staying here. I&#8217;m not supporting any criminals to be documented, because I believe that people who behave according to the law should be given an opportunity. People who are paying taxes, people who are contributing to this economy, like the Dreamers, and those are conversations that we don&#8217;t have.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No one in this country stays here for free, no one in this country does not pay taxes. Everyone pays taxes and that&#8217;s like, as an immigrant, you come here and you don&#8217;t get any break from paying taxes or anything — those are myths that are incorrect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Lee Carter, one of the issues you ran on was sort of getting corporate money out of politics. What would your approach be to try to limit or ultimately eliminate the influence that powerful corporate interests, including the defense industry, which is huge in Virginia, how do you get them out of politics? Where does it start?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC:\u003c/strong> Yeah so for a little background here, Virginia&#8217;s campaign finance laws are really sort of the wild west. There&#8217;s no limits on anything. You know, you can get unlimited contributions from corporate sources, you can get unlimited contributions from individuals, my opponent actually got a $61,000 single contribution from the National Association of Realtors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I see fighting against corporate control over Virginia politics as the first step to actually getting good policy on a number of issues. You know, it happens in all industries. My opponent sat on the subcommittee for consumer lending, and took money from Title Max and Loan Max and all these predatory lenders. And that happens over, and over, and over, again in every committee. Personally, I&#8217;m going to be fighting for an outright ban on corporate contributions in Virginia politics and a limit on individual contributions. Because a corporation shouldn&#8217;t be able to write a single check and fund an entire campaign. It just shouldn&#8217;t happen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Lee Carter, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>LC:\u003c/strong> And thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Elizabeth Guzman, thank you for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>EG:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me and thank you for the pronunciation of my last name.

This week on Intercepted: Sen. Chris Murphy blasts the U.S. government for its support of Saudi Arabia and lays out his fight to end the carnage in Yemen. Jeremy tears apart Thomas Friedman’s gross love letter to the Saudi crown prince and talks about the bi-partisan war against journalism from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump. As more women come forward to name their sexual assaulters and harassers, Intercept Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed and BuzzFeed’s Katie Baker analyze this unprecedented moment. Robert Mugabe was removed in a military coup, but his successor is a brutal thug from the same party. We get analysis from Harare, Zimbabwe, about why the U.S. and Britain supported Mugabe’s repressive regime, who is in control now, and what the future holds in this mineral rich country. Comedian Joe Pera performs a dramatic re-enactment of a secret Snowden document about a summer intern at the National Security Agency who experiences culture shock.

He knows what he&#8217;s doing and it&#8217;s insidious.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are three specific incidents that I believe should be cause for grave concern by anyone in this country who believes that we must have an independent and a free press.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>First, Donald Trump recently went on a Twitter rampage against big corporate media outlets, specifically CNN and NBC. Now, I have no great love for either of these outlets. Both of these institutions have used the airwaves to promote U.S. government propaganda. They have retired U.S. military generals and admirals and CIA operatives on their payrolls as independent analysts, and they never disclose the conflicts of interest that some of these so-called experts have who profit from the very wars and conflicts that they&#8217;re supposedly giving their independent views on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve always been clear about this and I&#8217;ve criticized both networks repeatedly, including on their own airwaves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill on CNN’s ‘Reliable Sources’: \u003c/strong>I also think that CNN and MSNBC and Fox are engaging in the Terrorism Expert Industrial Complex, where you have —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill on MSNBC’s ‘All in with Chris Hayes’:\u003c/strong> There has been no serious, hard-hitting critique of the president&#8217;s foreign policy from the issues that actually are real. This thing with him —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS CNN\u003c/strong>’\u003cstrong>s ‘The World Right Now with Hala Gorani’\u003c/strong>:CNN needs to immediately withdraw all retired generals and colonels from its airwaves. You know, Fareed&#8217;s Zakaria, if that guy could have sex with this cruise missile attack, I think he would do it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I also went after Chuck Todd, perhaps the most prominent figure at NBC News right now, he&#8217;s the host of Meet the Press, for his demeaning of people that were calling for CIA torturers to be held accountable when Barack Obama was first elected President.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeremy Scahill on Bill Maher\u003c/strong>: Chuck, you called it &#8220;political catnip&#8221; to talk about the CIA and Cheney&#8217;s role in this because it distracts from the important issues. This is a central issue and you called it cable catnip. You prevent future torture by prosecuting past acts of torture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Audience applause]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So I want to be clear that I believe that all media outlets, particularly big, powerful corporate networks should be criticized and blasted when they&#8217;re in the wrong or they&#8217;re serving as lapdogs for the powerful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what Trump is doing is suggesting that news outlets that don&#8217;t parrot his atrocious, and often crazy, talking points, should have their licenses revoked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He said that CNN&#8217;s job, this is what he believes, is to promote his brand of America, like Fox News does all around the world. Those are very serious ideas for the President of the United States to just sort of float out there on Twitter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He&#8217;s also stoking unfounded rage against the very institution of journalism and he did this throughout the campaign at his rallies and that can have grave consequences.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I have serious issues with a number of CNN personalities and the way that the network as a whole gave Trump endless airtime and they continue to do so at the expense of real reporting on serious crises like the U.S.-supported genocide in Yemen, the plight of poor and working people in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s not that CNN or NBC don&#8217;t cover these issues, it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re often squeezed in between covering Trump&#8217;s latest tweets or embarrassments or Russia, Russia, Russia — the priorities are totally warped.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, CNN has some incredible, brave international reporters, and camera people, and fixers, who regularly risk their lives to tell stories that matter. I&#8217;ve met them in war zones around the world. These are not political hacks or retired generals profiting from wars — no, they&#8217;re real journalists and they deserve our defense against attacks from the most powerful figure in the United States and arguably the world right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The second issue is that the Trump Administration has dramatically expanded the number of leak investigations in the United States. And Trump seems to believe that the Justice Department should get into the business of arresting reporters who publish classified information. He told then-FBI director James Comey that he should consider doing just that. The Justice Department right now is attempting to throw the book at an NSA contractor named Reality Winner, who they allege was the source of a document that was published by The Intercept. That document detailed alleged Russian operations aimed at targeting U.S. software companies that service the U.S. electoral system in a couple of dozen states in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reality Winner is right now being held, without bond, on charges of violating the Espionage Act. She could face decades in prison. In addition to this unjust denial of bail and the severity of the outrageous espionage charge against her and the potential prison sentence in this case, this is also an attack on journalism. Like Barack Obama, Donald Trump only wants journalists to publish official leaks or official pronouncements. That&#8217;s not how real journalism works, and every news outlet should be standing against these attacks and against Reality Winner’s imprisonment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The third issue: the U.S. government recently forced the television network RT to register as a foreign agent in the United States. RT has been accused by U.S. intelligence agencies, members of Congress, pundits of various political stripes of being a propaganda outlet for the Kremlin. RT has been cited as being part of an active coordinated misinformation campaign aimed at influencing the 2016 presidential election; they were cited in the U.S. intelligence community&#8217;s report.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Academics, journalists, politicians and others who have appeared on RT recently found their names publicly listed by an anti-Trump group, accusing them essentially of guilt by association.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The law that RT was forced to register under is the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which officially passed in 1938 and its aim was to stop the spread of Nazi propaganda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Jeanne Shaheen:\u003c/strong> The need for this legislation is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by the case of Russian propaganda networks like RT America and Sputnik International.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The Committee to Protect Journalists, which is a very mainstream U.S. press freedom organization, they have come out against this move saying that it could set a dangerous precedent that could result in criminalizing individual journalists who work for RT.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Under the law, RT is going to be forced to include a public disclaimer on any information that they send out in the United States, and the network is going to have to file a version of all of its reports — this could also mean social media transmissions — with the U.S. Justice Department within 48 hours of transmission. There are only a handful of media outlets that have been forced to register as foreign agents. I am entirely opposed to this action by the U.S. government. Already, Russia, which is a heinous enemy of journalism, has said that it&#8217;s now going to intensify the targeting of U.S. media outlets operating in Russia in retaliation for this action the U.S. has taken against RT.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But that&#8217;s not the only reason that I&#8217;m against this action. By singling out RT, the U.S. government is further eroding the very idea of a free press. Americans have a right to get their news from a variety of sources including state funded media outlets like the BBC, Al Jazeera, and, yes, RT. And when we start allowing the government to make up rules about who is and who is not a journalist, then the door for attacks on media organizations widens and widens. Of course RT broadcasts propaganda: it is a Kremlin-funded media outlet. And, by the way, Fox News is a propaganda outlet. It&#8217;s not state sponsored, but it&#8217;s propaganda nonetheless. Should Fox News be required to register as an agent for white supremacists or racists or Donald Trump? Should they be required to put a disclaimer saying that their reports are on behalf of the current President of the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know who has a show on RT? Larry King. Remember him from CNN? The guy with the suspenders? He says RT has never edited or intervened in his show. So RT is supposed to put a disclaimer on Larry King&#8217;s program saying it&#8217;s on behalf of the Russian government what about former MSNBC host and partisan Democrat Ed Schultz&#8217;s show on RT? It&#8217;s just nonsense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;ve appeared on RT a few times over the years and I&#8217;ve many times declined to appear. There were some shows and hosts that I thought were responsible and some that I didn&#8217;t. There are aspects of RT&#8217;s coverage that is undoubtedly propagandistic. And there were times when RT was willing to have me or other journalists on to discuss important stories that big, U.S. outlets were systematically ignoring or when they were parroting the U.S. government&#8217;s line. And RT reported on those stories accurately.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RT’s Alyona Minkovski:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m just curious why, then, it is that we haven&#8217;t seen you on every single news channel, why all of those real news networks out there aren&#8217;t dying to get the story from you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so far it&#8217;s just been Democracy Now!, Al Jazeera and Russia Today, RT, that have expressed serious interest in this story. And I should say —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I was asked numerous times to be on Bill O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s show on Fox News, and I declined all of those invites unless they would do it live.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Bill O’Reilly:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;ll do it live! We&#8217;ll do it live! Fuck it!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why did I insist on doing it live? Because I didn&#8217;t trust Bill O&#8217;Reilly and Fox News to edit the interview accurately. And, by the way, I also spoke out when the Obama Justice Department served a warrant on Google for Fox News reporter James Rosen&#8217;s personal e-mails, as I did when it obtained the Associated Press&#8217;s phone records.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The point of all of this is not that we cosign all or even most of what RT is doing. Or that RT is not a Russian state media organization — it is. The point is that it&#8217;s dangerous to have the U.S. government deciding what constitutes journalism and who constitutes a journalist and selectively choosing which media outlets should be subjected to these restrictions and which should not. There are an incredible number of state funded outlets who broadcast in the United States and have not been subjected to these restrictions. Where do we draw the line once we start down this path?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Trump is, no doubt, an enemy of the press and Trump&#8217;s authoritarian rhetoric is chilling. At the same time, we have to be honest: Trump did not start the U.S. war on press freedom, and I think it&#8217;s a mistake to view his attacks out of that historical context. Barack Obama? He prosecuted record numbers of whistleblowers and leakers under the Espionage Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Barack Obama:\u003c/strong> Leaks related to national security can put people at risk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Obama&#8217;s Justice Department threatened New York Times reporter James Risen with prison if he did not give up his source. Obama also personally intervened in Yemen to keep a Yemeni reporter who exposed the U.S. secret bombing campaign of Yemen in prison. Barack Obama was no friend of the free press either. Under Bush, the U.S. killed one of Al-Jazeera&#8217;s correspondents in Iraq. It was a direct hit on the position he was broadcasting from.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. military also shelled a hotel, killing two foreign journalists: one, a Spanish cameraman, and the other a Reuters photojournalist. Bush had Al Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj locked up in Guantanamo for six years without charge, where they were trying to force him to confess to a nonexistent link between Al Jazeera and al Qaeda. A U.S. helicopter gunship gleefully sprayed bullets on Iraqi civilians and killed two Reuters journalists.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>‘Collateral Murder’:\u003c/strong> Come on, fire. [Gunfire.] Keep shooting. [Gunfire.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In 1999, Bill Clinton authorized the bombing of Radio Television Serbia and killed 16 media workers. Most of those people were makeup artists and technicians and security guards — not a single propagandist for Slobodan Milosevic was killed: only the technical workers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Bill Clinton:\u003c/strong> We have to stand united with our allies for peace. By acting now, we are upholding our values, protecting our interests and advancing the cause of peace.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> U.S. Presidents always hold up the United States as this beacon of freedom, and for some people it certainly is. But let&#8217;s not pretend there&#8217;s not been a long, bipartisan war against journalism and journalists waged by the United States government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Across the globe, journalists are under attack and dying in record numbers. Whether it&#8217;s targeting journalistic sources in the U.S. or murdering journalists in Mexico, or assassinating them in Russia, it&#8217;s the responsibility of all of us in the news media to stand up and collectively say, &#8220;No.&#8221; That&#8217;s true under Trump and it should remain true the next time a Democrat is in the White House. Okay, on with the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Sen. Chris Murphy on the Key Role the U.S. Plays in Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Destruction of Yemen\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The unconscionable genocidal destruction of Yemen is continuing this week unabated. But don&#8217;t tell that to New York Times columnist and official chronicler of taxi drivers and hotel concierges who miraculously deliver perfect sound bites whenever he&#8217;s in their presence. I&#8217;m talking about Tom Friedman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No, Tom took to the pages of the paper of record to heap praise on the brutal thugs running Saudi Arabia&#8217;s vicious war against the poorest nation in the Arab world. Tom mentions that there is a humanitarian nightmare in Yemen and he refers to a &#8220;Saudi-backed war&#8221; as though the Saudis are just supporting this war that&#8217;s being waged by unknown assailants. Forget about mentioning the U.S. support for this brutal destruction — no, Tom had more important thoughts to share on the valuable real estate that is his New York Times column.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music fades in.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This story of Tom of Arabia begins with our mustached hero arriving in Riyadh during the Saudi winter, but soon discovering it&#8217;s actually an Arab Spring: Saudi style. You see, Tom informs us that this revolution is not coming from the people, but from the very top. And the hero of this story is the 32 year-old crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, or as Tom calls him, MBS. Tom manages to make his way from the airport to MBS&#8217;s ornate, adobe-walled palace. And there, Tom gathers with a group of people who have the pulse of the ordinary folks in the kingdom: the crown prince and his brother, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. and an assortment of several other senior government officials. According to Tom, they shared different lamb dishes that spiced the conversation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gob Bluth\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>:\u003c/strong> Fried cheese with club sauce.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lucille Austero:\u003c/strong> (moans)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gob Bluth\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>:\u003c/strong> Popcorn shrimp with club sauce.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lucille Austero:\u003c/strong> (moans)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gob Bluth\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>:\u003c/strong> Chicken fingers —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lucille Austero:\u003c/strong> Stop it, you&#8217;re making me dizzy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gob Bluth\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>:\u003c/strong> — with spicy club sauce.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lucille Austero:\u003c/strong> No, I mean stop it!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> After nearly four grueling hours with the prince and his crew and the lamb, Tom tells us that he surrendered at 1:15 AM to MBS&#8217;s youth, with Tom pointing out that he&#8217;s exactly twice the crown prince&#8217;s age. And then Tom observed, and I quote, “It&#8217;s been a long, long time, though, since any Arab leader wore me out with a fire hose of new ideas about transforming his country.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Okay, I&#8217;m not going to continue with this anymore (laughs), but the point is that this is the crap that Thomas Friedman writes in the so-called paper of record while Yemen is being utterly destroyed by the very people he was enjoying a variety of lamb dishes with. And Saudi officials — they sent Friedman&#8217;s piece around to journalists in Washington D.C. That&#8217;s usually a sign that you&#8217;re doing something wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>60 Minutes, they recently did a story on Yemen that completely removed any U.S. involvement in this slaughter. And the U.S. Congress refuses to do anything that would actually end the U.S. role in this unforgivable mass crime. There are a few members of Congress who have fought to cut off U.S. support for the Saudis and to end the annihilation of Yemen. The most vocal of these is Senator Chris Murphy, he&#8217;s a Democrat from Connecticut and he is on the Foreign Relations Committee. And he joins me right now. Senator Murphy, lay out what you believe the U.S. role has been in this war and the devastation that we&#8217;re witnessing right now in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Chris Murphy:\u003c/strong> I do not believe that Saudi Arabia could conduct this military campaign in Yemen without the United States. The United States provides the targeting assistance. The United States provides the munitions. The United States, in fact, provides the refueling to the Saudi and coalition jets mid-air without U.S. logistical support, without U.S. weapons, without U.S. arms sales: They simply could not be engaging in this destructive bombing campaign. At any time, the United States could cut off our support and in the face of a million cholera cases, in the face of thousands and thousands of Yemenis dying and many more starving to death, we have yet to deliver that message to the Saudis. And so, I make a very tough argument, but I think it&#8217;s a fair one: That every single death inside Yemen today has a U.S. imprint on it. And when I talk to Yemenis, as I remind my colleagues all the time, they tell me that inside Yemen, this is not seen as a Saudi bombing campaign. This is seen as a U.S.-Saudi bombing campaign. And so the long-term effect of this is that we are radicalizing potentially millions of Yemenis against the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, when you and Senator Rand Paul, who of course is a Republican, you co-sponsored the Stop Arming Terrorists Act and a majority of your Democratic colleagues, now that Trump is president, joined on to that effort, but you had a much more difficult time it seems convincing your Democratic colleagues to take this stance when Barack Obama was president, to what do you attribute that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Well they were two different resolutions, admittedly the first resolution to stop arms sales to the Saudis in 2016 was arguably not directly connected to the Yemen war. This arms sale in 2017 was. Also during that period of time, the Trump Administration removed basically all vestiges of pressure that the Obama administration had applied on the Saudis to try to correct their behavior. If you remember, Obama did in the end stop selling these precision guided weapons to the Saudis because of their targeting errors and because of their targeting successes when they were going after humanitarian sites. So, the Trump Administration was worse on this question then the Obama administration was. The arms sale was much more directly relevant to the war inside Yemen and the humanitarian catastrophe was a year worse in 2017 when we took that vote. So, sure, maybe some of the reason the more Democrats voted against it this year was because it wasn&#8217;t a Democrat in the White House but there are also some reasonable explanations for why some of those votes shifted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Another part of all of this that I find somewhat curious is the fact that whether it&#8217;s a Democrat in power or Republican in power, it&#8217;s sort of just assumed that the big picture line on Saudi Arabia is that they are necessary to our national security. And throughout both the Bush Administration and Obama Administration, you had the United States relying very heavily on Saudi intelligence to select its own targets inside of Yemen with drone strikes against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, in general, also the Saudis seem to be dictating a lot of U.S. policy on the Arabian Peninsula particularly in Yemen. Why is that the case and do you think that the U.S. should be relying so heavily on the Saudis?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s a real head scratcher and it&#8217;s an issue that I constantly raise here in Washington. As the flow of Saudi money moves through the Wahhabis to extremist groups and radical clerics all around the world, our eyes should be wider open than ever before as to the threat to U.S. national security that comes out of Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, certainly there are important counterterrorism intelligence programs between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. They have been able to achieve a kind of temporary detente between the GCC and Israel, that&#8217;s important to us. But the billions of dollars that flows out of this country that ends up radicalizing young men to join groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, that is directly contrary to U.S. national security interests. And so I have never understood why we are so deeply in bed with the Saudis. It probably has to do with our prior dependence on the Saudis for oil to power our country. It probably has something to do with all of the money to they have put into this town. You know, there are many think tanks in Washington D.C. that have Saudi money and end up coming to the Hill to recommend that in the strategic security interests of the United States that we must maintain our unbreakable alliance with the Saudis. They&#8217;ve been, done a good job of cementing this alliance with oil and now with money flowing into Washington, and I think there are more people now than ever that are questioning that relationship, but they don&#8217;t tend to be in this administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, Saudi diplomats have been sending around this week to journalists Thomas Friedman&#8217;s column in The New York Times which was basically just a kind of cartoonish praising of the Saudi crown prince, and doesn&#8217;t even mention the direct consequences that you&#8217;re citing that can be linked to the Saudi bombing and the U.S. support for it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Thomas Friedman: \u003c/strong>You think this bubble fantasy we&#8217;re just going to let it grow? Well suck on this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That, Charlie, was what this what this war was about. We could&#8217;ve hit Saudi Arabia. It was part of that bubble. We could&#8217;ve hit Pakistan. We hit Iraq because we could.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> At the same time, 60 Minutes, I give them credit, they took 13 or 15 minutes to talk about Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>60 Minutes Scott Pelley:\u003c/strong> This mother, Ameena Saleh, told us her family left after Saudi-led airstrikes killed more than 70 people in her town.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;The planes would fly above us and fire rockets and missiles like this,&#8221; she told us. &#8220;At night there was no sleep and we were holding the young ones.&#8221; She said that her older son was saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to die.&#8221; She told us, &#8220;We saw people die right in front of us.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> But none of what you&#8217;re talking about was included in that. It&#8217;s almost as though there is this epic crime with no perpetrator, when everyone actually knows that there is a perpetrator, there&#8217;s multiple perpetrators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Remember, what is the greatest threat to the United States today? Every politician will tell you it&#8217;s the potential of a terrorist attack. Where does that attack emanate from? It&#8217;s Sunni extremist groups. Where does the money come from that creates an intolerant version of Islam that prompts people to want to do violence against nonbelievers? It&#8217;s Saudi Arabian money, it&#8217;s Gulf state money that comes out of the Wahhabi movement, and you know you can&#8217;t tell the story of Yemen just through the lens of the epic humanitarian catastrophe. You have to acknowledge that the most lethal arm of al Qaeda, AQAP, has gotten bigger and stronger inside Yemen during this civil war because they have sort of gobbled up the ungovernable territory created by the civil war. ISIS, which didn&#8217;t have a footprint in Yemen, now has a pretty big one. And so if we&#8217;re really fighting these radical groups, why on earth are we participating in a war inside Yemen that&#8217;s actually causing those radical groups to get stronger?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Do you believe that the Houthis, which is primarily a northern-based, Shiite-minority movement in Yemen that doesn&#8217;t fact control the majority of the capital right now, do you believe that this is directly an Iranian proxy at this point?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Iran has taken advantage of this civil war in order to draw closer to the Houthis, but there has never been a command and control relationship in the way that it exists with Hezbollah in many places. But every single day that the Saudis continue to drop bombs inside Yemen is a day that the Houthis get closer to the Iranians. The Saudis are essentially creating, you know, their own problem by pushing together these two groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, no, it has never been as simple as the Iranians running a proxy army inside Yemen, but they are becoming more interdependent. But that&#8217;s because this civil war has perpetuated, and the Houthis seen no political route out of this mess. And, by the way, you know as well as I do that the Houthis are not blameless when it comes to the humanitarian catastrophe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They have hit civilians, they have contributed to this nightmare, most of the deaths are caused by Saudi activity but there are plenty of very bad actors on the Houthi side as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is the reason that you&#8217;re given by the Democrats who are not on board with what you&#8217;re doing? I mean clearly you&#8217;ve done, more than any lawmaker, in your official capacity to raise awareness specifically what&#8217;s happening in Yemen, and I give you, and we&#8217;ve said this on our show, enormous credit for naming the U.S. role in this. But what&#8217;s the defense that any of your Democratic colleagues offer you and why they won&#8217;t join your effort?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Well, again, let&#8217;s just remind ourselves that there aren&#8217;t many Democrats left that oppose my efforts to cut off funding for this conflict. I think there were, you know, maybe three or four Democrats in the Senate who voted against my measure earlier this year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But, to the extent that there has been resistance, it is tied up in this construct that you were handed when you were elected to Congress that the United States are resolute allies with the Saudis, and that it is sacrilegious to break that bond. There is also a belief, that&#8217;s been built up by the Saudi lobby here, that the Houthis are agents of Iran and if you are an anti-Iranian member of Congress then you have to be supporting the Saudis inside Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ultimately the Saudis are going to be cut off here. I mean we are trending in a direction such that the next arms sale will not be approved by Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What can someone in your position do to break through the silence on this when you have North Korea and you have a president who seems to be trying to tweet us either into a war or into being the laughing stock of the world?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> Well, I wish the famine and the cholera epidemic moved people. I mean this is not a naturally occurring famine, this is a manmade famine, this is a manmade cholera outbreak and the United States has been a participant in causing it. I wish that that was enough.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think we&#8217;ve got to talk more about the national security implications here. I think we need to make it very clear to people that al Qaeda, the group that Donald Trump tells us he is going to stamp out, is getting stronger inside that country because we are giving them space to grow. So, I think for the members of Congress are still left over, that haven&#8217;t joined us here, we&#8217;ve got to make it very clear that we are putting this country at risk by continuing to be involved in this civil war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the so-called adults in the room, Defense Secretary General James Mattis, has a very hawkish track record with regards to Iran and you definitely have people permeating the Trump circle on a foreign policy level that believe that Iran-Contra was not a scandal but a model for how the United States should be conducting itself. Are you concerned that part of what we&#8217;re seeing here in Yemen with the Trump Administration adopting this line, that it&#8217;s really a war against Iran could lead to U.S. military action in Iran?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> I don&#8217;t have any information or evidence that the Administration is planning military activity against Iran directly. But what I know is that the more deeply that you get involved in these conflicts and we have not yet talked about the fact that we now have upwards of a thousand U.S. troops inside Syria today, the harder it is to avoid conflicts with countries that are also involved. What we saw in Syria, for instance, is that when Iranian-backed militia forces got too close to U.S. forces we fired upon them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We attacked Bashar al-Assad under the pretext that his chemical weapons usage posed a danger to U.S. forces that were in the region.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The way in which this administration has broadened out its authority to conduct military activity in the Middle East suggests that it thinks it has the legal ability to go after anyone and any actor and any country in the region the potentially poses a threat to U.S. forces. Iran is on that list and so the broad jurisdiction that the administration has granted itself regarding military activity could conceivably convince them to launch an attack against the Iranians without congressional approval. Now, I don&#8217;t have any information that they are planning on doing that. I just worry that they have given themselves a carte blanche in the region that seems to have no end.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, the last report that we have from Special Operations Command in Tampa is that the U.S. has special operations personnel deployed in more than 130 countries around the world. Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re engaged in combat in all of those countries, but recent events in places like Mali, and Niger, and increasingly Somalia are a good indication that there is a tremendous amount happening in the, in the shadows under this president, but it also happened a lot under Barack Obama, that not only are the American people not aware of it, but the Congress doesn&#8217;t seem to be briefed on many of these operations or doesn&#8217;t seem to be demanding the information that would be required to effectively oversee it. How concerned are you with the fact that we have 800 troops in Niger, 400 troops in Mali, we don&#8217;t know how many troops are in Somalia? All of these places are potential areas where U.S. body bags could be coming home, but also actions could be taken that cause blowback on us down the line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CM:\u003c/strong> I think we have to go back and take a look at how we authorize this dispersion of U.S. forces around the world. What we learned in Niger was that those troops are there under an authority given to the executive by Congress, in Title X, to help train and equip foreign forces. Now, it sort of doesn&#8217;t feel like we were in the business of training and equipping given that we had our guys out there doing real life dangerous missions. Technically, were we with local troops? We were. But it seemed like we were engaged in more operational capacity than we were in training capacity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, here&#8217;s one way to solve this and I haven&#8217;t submitted this as legislation yet, I just think it&#8217;s worth thinking about: Why doesn&#8217;t Congress in the annual defense authorization bill actually list out the countries that the Department of Defense is allowed to do this training and equipping in? If they have to do it on an emergency basis that&#8217;s fine, they can do it for the rest of the year, but they have to come back the next year and get explicit authorization.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Right now, it&#8217;s a blank check, that they can train and equip in any country they want. They can put an unlimited number of Special Forces operators into those countries and there&#8217;s, as we&#8217;ve learned, real fuzzy territory between training and soldiering.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, there are ways that we could look at to get Congress more deeply involved in the question of where we are deployed. We could actually have a debate about that every year in the Defense Authorization Bill, and my feeling is that that would be a lot closer to the division of power on foreign policy that the Founding Fathers imagined.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Senator Chris Murphy is a Democrat from Connecticut. He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Sexual Assault in the Media, Hollywood, and Politics\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right now, in the United States, we are witnessing an unprecedented moment. Scores of women are coming forward and bravely naming the men who have sexually harassed, assaulted, raped and otherwise abused or mistreated them. The cases that we read about or hear about are of course those involving powerful men, men who use their positions and influence to assault or harass women. The meticulous reporting on Hollywood kingpin Harvey Weinstein seems to have opened a floodgate for women to speak out and demand accountability.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s not just women. In the case of actor Kevin Spacey, his alleged victims were men. Some of these cases have resulted in the firing of prominent men in journalism or the resignation of others. In some cases they may result in criminal prosecutions. We also know that Harvey Weinstein hired two private security companies to spy on and dig up dirt on some of his accusers. One of those firms was an Israeli company staffed by former Mossad agents and other Israeli military and intelligence units.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Right now, we also have a president who has been accused of rape, sexual harassment and assault, and who was caught on tape bragging about how he grabs women “by the pussy.” The president has come out in support of the Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who is facing a barrage of allegations including assaulting teenage girls. The longest-serving member of Congress, Democrat John Conyers, has just stepped down as chair of the Judiciary Committee following public allegations that he sexually harassed and possibly assaulted women working for him. Conyers is denying all of this and says he is going to fight this. Al Franken&#8217;s political career, at the same time, is very much in question and there are certainly scores of men in media, film, government, and other industries who walk around wondering when their abuse or harassment of women will come to light.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is definitely an historic moment and one which has the potential to bring much needed change to the sexist and misogynist culture that permeates our society. But that&#8217;s going to require not only the brave blowing of the whistle by women, but men actually listening and institutions taking action.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To discuss all of this I&#8217;m joined by two people. Katie Baker is an investigative reporter at BuzzFeed News. She&#8217;s tenaciously covered this beat for years and Betsy Reed is the editor in chief of The Intercept. Welcome, both of you, to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Katie Baker\u003c/strong>: Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Betsy Reed:\u003c/strong> Thanks, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I was trying to think of any kind of historical analog to what we&#8217;re witnessing right now with so many people coming forward and stating what happened to them at the hands of powerful men, whether they&#8217;re in Hollywood or media, etc. And there seems like there is, in many of these cases, this immediate sense of there&#8217;s going to be accountability right now. The closest thing I can think of is like, the overthrow of dictatorships or like kind of like the Arab Spring where you see this sort of instant reaction, the likes of which I can&#8217;t recall another moment in time that would be similar to this. How do you see this moment that we&#8217;re in right now, given all of the reporting you&#8217;ve done for years on these issues?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> I think what&#8217;s unprecedented is not just people sharing their stories of sexual assault and harassment, but the almost immediate accountability that appears to be happening, at least with famous people. I&#8217;ve written about a lot of powerful men who women accused of sexual assault and harassment who faced bad publicity but no repercussions. And I think what&#8217;s happening right now is really exciting and overwhelming because it does feel like the consequences are happening — literally the same day, in many cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> A lot of the coverage of this right now links back to the Harvey Weinstein moment and this deluge of allegations against him from a variety of very prominent women in Hollywood. You also have the reality of Donald Trump being president and openly bragging about sexually assaulting women.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> You know, I&#8217;m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them, it&#8217;s like a magnet. Just kissing. And when you&#8217;re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Billy Bush:\u003c/strong> Whatever you want.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Grab &#8217;em by the pussy. You can do anything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Not to mention the fact that there are serious questions about whether he&#8217;s raped people or committed acts beyond what we already know that he&#8217;s owned. Your view on sort of where we are right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> Well, I mean I think Donald Trump&#8217;s election in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape and all the allegations that the New York Times had reported before that, it really tapped into a well of fury and outrage among women. I think it helped sort of establish that this was a really legitimate area for like mainstream newspapers to pursue. It takes a lot of resources, as we all know, to pursue these stories and The New York Times devoted two, you know, top reporters for almost a year, right, on the story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it is, you know, ironic that basically he seems to have gotten off scot-free and I think that it&#8217;s perfectly appropriate for him to be facing heat. It&#8217;s unclear kind of what path that could take politically, but I think it&#8217;s very legitimate how those women feel who came forward with their stories about Trump and basically felt like they were, you know, slapped in the face by the result of the election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now, Katie, you&#8217;ve written about Juanita Broaddrick, who now for several decades has been emphatic that she was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Juanita Broaddrick:\u003c/strong> It was not consensual.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lisa Myers:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re saying that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted you, that he raped you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do we know about Bill Clinton and sexual assault, sexual harassment. You did a deep dive into Juanita Broaddrick. What&#8217;s the truth of that as you understand it from your reporting?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB\u003c/strong>: In the summer of 2016, my editor Ben Smith suggested I try and profile Juanita Broaddrick because no mainstream media outlet had done so since she first spoke out in the late 90s. I did not know who Juanita Broaddrick was. I&#8217;m not that young — I&#8217;m 30. So, it&#8217;s not as if — I had no excuse. And I was, when I started researching and reading up on her extremely credible, consistent allegations I was really shocked that I had no idea who she was and I asked people of various ages, older, as well as younger, and even if people kind of remembered her, no one really, people just thought, &#8220;Oh, well, those were not credible,&#8221; or they didn&#8217;t quite remember them. But Juanita Broaddrick has said for years that Bill Clinton raped her in a hotel room, not a gray area situation. She said that she was supposed to have a business meeting with him when he forcibly raped her.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the reasons why she didn&#8217;t speak out right away are extremely credible, the same types of reasons that we&#8217;re hearing almost every day right now: she was scared, she didn&#8217;t think anybody would believe her, she fell intimidated, and she only ultimately spoke out because reporters were on to her. She didn&#8217;t seek out reporters — sort of like what we&#8217;re seeing with Roy Moore and his accusers didn&#8217;t go to the Washington Post, the Washington Post came to them. Juanita was bombarded until she finally sat down and tried to tell her story and then she was almost immediately disbelieved and dismissed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I was really struck by, in your piece, how you show this very revealing chronicle of the costs when these kinds of cases are politicized and used as like, you know, weaponized political footballs. And, you know, as much as you are respectful to her and her credibility in her story, you also raise some really hard questions about how she allowed her story to be used.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB\u003c/strong>: Completely. It was a really, really complicated story to write, especially at that time. That was before Juanita had officially decided to essentially join the Trump campaign and go to the debates and sit there and really campaign for him essentially.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JB:\u003c/strong> Hi, I&#8217;m Juanita Broaddrick, and I&#8217;m here to support Donald Trump. I tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted me, that actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump may&#8217;ve said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me, and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any comparison.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> Juanita Broaddrick kept telling me that the only reason she was voting for Trump was because she didn&#8217;t want Hillary to win, and that she wasn&#8217;t ever going to work for his campaign. And I could kind of tell that that she was lying and that it was the direction she was going in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But I also completely understood why, because if you find her allegations credible, she has been dismissed not just by the Democratic Party, but by the types of progressive organizations that typically support and believe rape victims. And then, at the same time, you had Breitbart treating her story with the sensitivity of Jezebel or something, going, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s very common for rape victims to not come forward and this all makes a lot of sense.&#8221; And then you had liberal publications completely ignoring it, and I agree that the politicization of sexual assault claims is really troubling and I think that we&#8217;re seeing that happening right now as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Betsy, I want to ask you about this other major high profile case that took place during the same time period in terms of when it came to public light, and that was the Clarence Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court. Anita Hill, even this past week was on the Sunday talk shows and was calling out both Republicans and Democrats for their role not only in perpetrating these kinds of crimes against women, but in building this wall of silence around them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Anita Hill:\u003c/strong> I think we&#8217;re really at the tip of the iceberg here. Many stories have already come out. But there are still women who are marginalized, women who are in minimum wage jobs, women of color who may be fearful of coming forward with their stories because they don&#8217;t want to embarrass people racially. There are all kinds of things at play.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Clarence Thomas wouldn&#8217;t be confirmed to the Supreme Court today, is that your assessment?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I would say that&#8217;s a fair assumption. I remember personally watching it, being completely glued to it and horrified.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AH:\u003c/strong> After approximately three months of working there, he asked me to go out socially with him. What happened next, and telling the world about it, are the two most difficult things, experiences of my life. It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and sleepless number — great number of sleepless nights, that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone but my close friends.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I just couldn&#8217;t believe, you know, having this feminist education, I couldn&#8217;t believe that like things were really this bad. That like, not only would you get harassed like this but you come forward and then to be subjected to this kind of, you know, character destruction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then I thought, you know, sort of hopefully, “well this will provoke you know a conversation, there&#8217;s a lot of feminist organizing around it.” But actually then what we saw over the succeeding couple of decades is not a whole lot of progress, and, in fact we had the development of this entire system which, in many cases, has served the interests of the harassers has, like as we saw with Weinstein, basically, you know, he had this whole apparatus with lawyers and you know, NDAs, and settlements. And if you look now at what&#8217;s gone on in Congress, that now it&#8217;s under the spotlight, what&#8217;s happening what with the congressional system for investigating reports of sexual harassment, in light of the accusations against John Conyers, it&#8217;s coming under a long overdue scrutiny that basically it&#8217;s essentially a mechanism for covering up all of these payouts and there&#8217;s calls for it to reveal not only, you know, the people who in the last year but going retroactively if that happens, if we actually see, you know, get some sunlight into that and see what&#8217;s happened over the last twenty years, you&#8217;re gonna see a lot more people going down.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press this weekend and she quite clearly tried to draw distinction between the allegations against her Democratic colleagues and Roy Moore.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nancy Pelosi:\u003c/strong> John Conyers is an icon in our country. He has done a great a great deal to protect women, the Violence Against Women Act, which the left wing, right wing is now quoting me as praising him for his work on that. And he did great work on that. But the fact is, as John reviews his case, which he knows, which I don&#8217;t, I believe he won&#8217;t do —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chuck Todd:\u003c/strong> Why don&#8217;t you — ?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> May I finish my sentence?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CT:\u003c/strong> Sure, sure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>NP:\u003c/strong> That he will the right thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And a lot of people went berserk at her, and I think rightly so. What did you make of the way that she talked about John Conyers and the allegations against him versus Roy Moore and the allegations against him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> Well, I think this goes back to what we were just discussing about Juanita Broaddrick, the politicization of sexual assault claims, the way that they&#8217;re used by politicians to attack the opposite side but as we&#8217;re seeing now and as we&#8217;ve seen for decades, when it comes to their own party, both sides are not very good at taking accountability.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I definitely think that there&#8217;s no accountability without transparency which is why all of this news that&#8217;s coming out, both from Weinstein to Conyers, about all of these confidential settlements and NDAs. I report a lot on academia and they call it &#8220;passing the trash&#8221; there. If people are allowed to pay out settlements and there&#8217;s no record, and people can just go from job to job, whether that&#8217;s in Hollywood in academia and politics without anybody knowing what really happened, and, in my experience, at least that means often times that they face multiple accusations of the same behavior.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I do think that we are seeing some progress, though, in that there are prominent Democrats really calling for accountability for Al Franken and John Conyers, really vocal people like Jackie Spears and Kristen Gillibrand. So, I mean, I think there is more willingness now —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB: \u003c/strong>Definitely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> — than before, you know, Nancy Pelosi aside to actually really clean our own house first. And you even see this like with Fox News, right? And some of the women who came forward there and what ultimately happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> Well, something I was really struck by is last week when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders:\u003c/strong> I think in one case, specifically, Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn&#8217;t. I think that&#8217;s a very clear distinction. Major.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What Trump has sort of shown is if you just bulldoze through this and you refuse to cede any territory, it&#8217;s like — the guy won the presidency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He has more than a dozen allegations, specific allegations of either rape or other forms of sexual assault and harassment against him, he openly brags about this, and he won. I mean the message that that has sent, and I think the Roy Moore thing taps into it, is just deny, deny, deny, fake news, fake news, and that&#8217;s my model for doing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> He totally denies. He says it didn&#8217;t happen. And, you have to listen to him also. You&#8217;re talking about, he said 40 years ago, this did not happen. So, you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> That is partly the consequence of what we&#8217;ve been talking about, like all of these charges have been so politicized for so long. The nasty way that the parties operate with opposition research kind of allowed Trump to say, &#8220;This is just fake news. This is just another example of like the Hillary oppo research.&#8221; And then look at Bill, and then he trots out all of Bill&#8217;s accusers and he puts them in the front row, and it just became part of that sort of circus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s talk about men in our industry, in news media, the most prominent recent case is probably Glenn Thrush who was at Politico, now at the New York Times, and he basically has done a kinda, what I would call a sorta culpa, where he&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Oh yeah, maybe I was inappropriate, but I was an alcoholic.&#8221; What do you make of those kinds of responses — Glenn Thrush is not alone in sort of treating it that way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> Something that I am really interested in thinking more about is what do we do with all of these men. If the #metoo movement shows how endemic not just sexual assault and rape are, but sexual harassment and other coercive forms of gender-based discrimination, whatever you want to call it, from more minor grievances all the way down to rape. And I think if we&#8217;re going to talk about everything on the spectrum, which I have been trying to do for years in my reporting and that, and which I really support, we have to think: What does rehabilitation look like? What does it mean for someone to be held accountable? You know, we can&#8217;t just expect all the men in our lives to disappear from the face of the earth. I don&#8217;t want to send more people to prison, personally. So you know, what do you do? Should companies be held accountable? Should institutions be held accountable?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Unfortunately I do not have the answers, but this is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about a lot and I do think that I don&#8217;t want to put more responsibility on the victims to have to hold their assaulters or harassers accountable and make sure they do better. But I also don&#8217;t feel that optimistic about institutions doing the work to make sure people are going through counseling or whatever else we decide would show that somebody was, was really changing their behavior\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Dylan Byers, who now is at CNN, he now has deleted this tweet because he said he was misunderstood, but he tweeted that “obviously the focus of the should be on the victims, but what an incredible drain of talent this has resulted in.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And it&#8217;s like: First of all, I want to ask him like, &#8220;What is the world missing from Mark Halperin disappearing from our lives?&#8221; Zero. It makes Morning Joe slightly more tolerable, but what should the consequences be? I don&#8217;t necessarily mean legally in courts, but in this industry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> In terms of the talent drain, what my immediate thought was: What about the massive drain of talent that this epidemic of sexual harassment has produced in terms of women in leadership? There are countless stories if you look hard, it&#8217;s like, OK, what happened after this, this person was harassed, like a lot of them have taken a different turn, they choose a different career, they leave that organization and they don&#8217;t have that path to rise-up. So, I think that&#8217;s what we need to be focused on, and also on the opportunities that this kind of crisis and discussion creates for a different kind of path to leadership for women, because I think it really does — I mean, women are not perfect in power. There are women in many of these scenarios who played powerful roles. Like Charlie Rose&#8217;s producer, right, was an enabler and has really, you know, apologized for what she done. So, it is not perfect to have a woman in power, but I do believe it makes a difference and I do think that if we can really gain anything from this moment, you know, it&#8217;s going to shift the overall gender power dynamics in the industry.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> I completely agree with Betsy. I mean, one thing I hope comes out of this moment is ensuring, that there&#8217;s more women in positions of power, as imperfect as they are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> I wonder, I mean maybe it&#8217;s just a fantasy but like it is interesting to imagine what Hollywood would be like, what changes in film and television we&#8217;ll see, if this genuinely empowers women in that industry in producing and directing and writing roles, because I think we do see the sort of sexism of the behind the scenes part of the industry reflected on the screen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I wanted to ask you both, you know, some weeks ago it came to public light that there was this Google spreadsheet that was shared by, we don&#8217;t know necessarily the specific individuals, but led to believe that it&#8217;s women in media that was referred to as the Shitty Media Men list, and you had dozens of names of people working in media and then it had specific allegations against them and some of those cases ended up in the public light. And, in some cases, there seem to be validity to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In others, it seems plausible that some of the men that are being accused on that list by anonymous individuals may not have anything that they&#8217;ve done and it&#8217;s sort of been used by the Mike Cernovichs of our current world to try to destroy people&#8217;s careers. What do you think about that specifically, that Shitty Media Men list, but also the sort of anonymity of some of the allegations against a variety of men?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> First of all, it has to be understood as what it was originally intended as like a document to be shared among women privately. It was never intended, in the first place, for public consumption and the accusations on there while, as you note, some of them have turned into real cases where real victims have come forward. And that is not true of a lot of the stuff on that list.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we do have to kind of take this whole situation very seriously and part of that means like distinguishing when you have an actual credible accuser, a person who&#8217;s making a specific claim, and a random, anonymous list circulating that doesn&#8217;t even have any particular individual attached to any of the allegations on it. So that belongs in a different category and we have to just take seriously what evidence is before us, and that means believing women who come forward as a starting point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> As far as the list goes, when I first saw it my first thought was “this is not a true community resource” because it is anonymously accessible and edited by anyone. And I support women gossiping and sharing stories, and I think that&#8217;s crucial, and I understand that women that aren&#8217;t as connected, or that you know are newer to media might really benefit from a list when they couldn&#8217;t get that gossip firsthand. But definitely as a reporter who, as I just said, really thinks a lot about how to support peoples&#8217; stories, my first thought when I saw the list was, “oh my God, this is not going to end well for the women on the list, you know? Who knows if they&#8217;re even writing this themselves.” I definitely found it alarming.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the more I thought about it, I thought, well this is a messy solution to a messy problem. And I&#8217;ve written about women coming together in similar situations in different industries before and often people feel like they have no other option, especially when investigations are often covered up confidentiality agreements. Or otherwise, I think that people often feel that they have no other option but to write on the bathroom wall, so to speak.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so I am really sympathetic to it and I understand it, but definitely as a reporter, my first thought when I saw the list was: “Is this the best way to create change?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, it&#8217;s been a month or so and from my perspective, at least, the list has led to some really important reporting and, as far, as I know I haven&#8217;t heard of any unfair repercussions as a result of the list. Again, I think the best way to put it is I think it&#8217;s a messy solution to a messy problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Katie, as we wrap up, I wanted to make sure that we address the fact this is not just famous men who do these things or prominent men who these things that need to be held accountable. You&#8217;ve written about powerful non-globally famous or even nationally famous men alleged to have raped people. Your latest report is documenting these 180-plus allegations of sexual assault at a company called Massage Envy, which is a chain of spas around the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Maybe you could talk, tying in this piece and some of the other reporting you&#8217;ve done, but about how women across the country are facing the same kinds of sexual assault, rape, sexual harassment that Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s victims face but there&#8217;s really isn&#8217;t reporting on it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB:\u003c/strong> My story was about predominantly women going to Massage Envy spas and being very brutally sexually assaulted by male massage therapists. There are just so many reports of it, and after looking into it, I found that the policies and practices of the company is to investigate these claims internally without any training or outside help. And I think from colleges to businesses such as Massage Envy, there are a lot of companies and institutions that really care about protecting their brand, sometimes more so than assuring that these complaints are handled appropriately. But then, of course, our criminal justice system is completely awful at investigating and handling rape claims, which is something I also report a lot about, so I hope that this cultural moment that is happening now trickles down so that people whose assaulters are not famous are still being addressed even if they&#8217;re not Harvey Weinstein or a politician.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Betsy, I have to ask you, because you&#8217;re the editor-in-chief of The Intercept, a former employee of First Look, our parent company, who also did work on Intercept stories over a certain period of time, Morgan Marquis-Boire, there are very serious allegations of rape that have been leveled against him. The Verge did a very in-depth report on these allegations, we also — I mean there are specific women I know when this started coming out told me that friends of theirs had been victims of him. Maybe you could explain to people who listen to this show or are supporters or readers of The Intercept, your perspective on that case, because you just had to deal with the fact that you had a man who was employed at our institution and did do work and was bylined on some pieces at The Intercept accused of very heinous, serious crimes, including rape.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BR:\u003c/strong> Morgan Marquis-Boire was a director of security here, he was working directly with The Intercept in 2015, so I overlapped with him for about nine months, and then he went on to a different role within First Look, and, you know, throughout we actually did not hear any allegations like this about him, and his employment here ended in September of this past year, right before, like three weeks before all of the spilled out on social media. So, I can understand how it kind of looked like, “oh, we discovered this and fired him.” But like that actually didn&#8217;t happen. We were like as shocked as anyone else reading this on social media, and horrified. And we also had no kind of specific allegations from anyone to follow up on, because this did not actually happen to anyone who&#8217;s on our staff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that was not true of Freedom of the Press Foundation and Citizen&#8217;s Lab, his other employers, and they did their own internal process of investigation, and they made statements. But since we didn&#8217;t have an accuser, there was nothing to actually follow up on, until we saw the exhaustive and chilling report in The Verge by Sarah Jiang, which laid out in painful detail with many very specific claims from multiple different women. And, at that point, you know, we felt like it was really important for us to make a statement about it, and, you know, to say that we have no tolerance for this kind of behavior here, but not only that, that we actually, you know, we recognize that this person was in our orbit and he&#8217;s accused of these things and we&#8217;re determined to stamp out misogyny and sexual harassment and abuse and do anything — everything — in our power to confront it and to support the women who have come forward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re going to leave it there.

Last week, Mugabe&#8217;s former vice president, President Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in. This followed a series of moves by a collection of powerful Zimbabwean military figures, where they seized control of state television and told Mugabe to his face that he was no longer president. Now, Mugabe did put up somewhat of a fight, we understand. But when his own party ZANU–PF sacked him, and he faced near certain impeachment, Mugabe accepted his fate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The events of the past year in Zimbabwe made clear that there was going to be a showdown over the future control of the country. The only real question was whether it would happen before or after the 93-year-old Mugabe died.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mugabe had made very clear that he had chosen his wife Grace as his successor. Widely viewed as corrupt and out of touch, Grace and her G40 faction of the ruling ZANU–PF party were not going to take power without a very serious fight. So, in some ways, what the military did was to hasten events that seemed inevitable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, China has substantial investments in Zimbabwe in mining, construction, and security, and has long had a close relationship with Robert Mugabe. What role, if any, Beijing may have played in this military coup is not clear at this point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Under Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe&#8217;s economy has been a disaster. And his rhetoric of giving land and sustainability to the country&#8217;s overwhelmingly black majority has consistently proven hollow. Zimbabwe is a country rich in mineral resources, yet the vast majority of Zimbabweans struggle to make ends meet in their daily lives. Despite his human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, Mugabe has long been preferred by Western powers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the time of Zimbabwe&#8217;s independence in 1980, Mugabe was seen by the United States as a safer alternative to more progressive forces and allies of Nelson Mandela&#8217;s ANC in neighboring South Africa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The new president of Zimbabwe was himself a longtime ally of Mugabe and was considered a hero of their independence war and he was also the former head of the country&#8217;s security services. His nickname is The Crocodile.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Emmerson Mnangagwa has a reputation for brutality and as Mugabe&#8217;s enforcer. Early last month, he claimed that he had to be airlifted to South Africa after an attempt to poison him. Many Zimbabweans believe that Mugabe or his wife were behind it: we may never know. But the point is that now this man is in charge of Zimbabwe. To get a sense of what is happening on the ground right now, we go to the capital, Harare, where we are joined by a Zimbabwean journalist. We are not going to name our guest for his own safety, but we now welcome him to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Anonymous:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain why you felt anonymity was necessary at this moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> We have been getting WhatsApp messages about soldiers who have been asking people about IDs. If you don&#8217;t have your IDs, you are taken to the barracks where they interrogate you, and people are talking about people who have been disappeared. There&#8217;s no ways of verifying this, but when you look at the treatment that has been meted out on the former minister of finance, Ignatius Chombo, he was abducted from his home, was held in a barracks someone, for days on end, until he appeared in court last weekend.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, there is still an atmosphere of fear because we don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re looking for, we don&#8217;t know when this will end, soldiers are still patrolling, we basically are in a state of emergency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain the political context of what happened, because it seemed as though when the military came to tell Mugabe basically he was finished, they didn&#8217;t go to kill Mugabe or execute him in public, and in fact the man who is now the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, he was Mugabe&#8217;s vice president, and some months ago was sacked by Mugabe. So was this a coup? Is this just sort of ZANU-PF continuing on, albeit without Mugabe? Like, what&#8217;s happening right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> Basically, what&#8217;s going on now, maybe you could call it Mugabism without Mugabe. The reason why the army, there&#8217;s been doubts about what happened, in fact, even when the army took over, when they went on ZBC, our local broadcaster, they were keen to emphasize that it was not a coup.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Sibusiso Moyo:\u003c/strong> We wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover of government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> But actually it was a coup in all but name, because basically what they did was they basically went to Mugabe&#8217;s house and disarmed his presidential guard, and put away everyone who was opposed to what they were doing, including the deputy director general of the Central Intelligence Organization, they went after him. He was arrested for, for some days, and Mugabe himself, maybe for the first two or three days, couldn&#8217;t move out of his property, in the north of Harare. So, it was a coup.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, what was precipitated what the army did, was the firing of Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is a hero of the War of Independence, which was fought between 1972 and &#8217;79. In &#8217;77, he became Mugabe&#8217;s personal assistant, and before that, in the 60s, he had been part of what&#8217;s called in Zimbabwe “the Crocodile Gang,” which explains the crocodile moniker that is attached to President Mnangagwa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So he is a deeply revered figure in ZANU-PF, especially among the security elites and they saw him as key to the Mugabist project. But a few years ago, Mugabe had started to show that he had other intentions. And it was around this time, his wife, Grace Mugabe, also started showing political ambitions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, basically, what happened was, to stop Mugabe from imposing his wife as his successor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This man who is now the president, Mnangagwa, he also has a reputation for brutality and was, at times, running various entities within the security apparatus the intelligence apparatus for Robert Mugabe. Talk about his reputation for brutality or repression within Zimbabwe as a sort of henchman for Robert Mugabe. A: So what happened was, in the 60s, in the early 60s, there was this one big party which was called Zimbabwe African Peoples Union, ZAPU, which was led by Joshua Nkomo, who is now late. So, Mugabe and other key people in, in this party broke away, informed what is now ZANU.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, with time, ZAPU, came to be identified as a Ndebele party. And the Ndebeles are people in the, in the South of country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So with the result in ‘81, there was battles in the townships, in Bulawayo, which is our second city. Scores of people died. And then from that time, the war kind of moved from guerillas into these two parties to a war, a war against all Ndebele-speaking people in the south, in the southwest of the country, and it&#8217;s estimated that up to 20,000 people were killed in this operation. Emmerson Mnangagwa, and Perence Shiri, who is now air vice marshal, and people like Ernest Kadungure, who is now late, and the former defense minister in Mugabe’s government, Sydney Sekeramayi, were key lieutenants in basically killing people who were defenseless. And, Mnangagwa was the more volatile person in this war. He basically threatened people, which is why, especially in the South of the country, among the Ndebele people, his ascension to power has been viewed with fear, because of his key role. It&#8217;s easy to blame him for what happened, but actually, the person who was ultimately responsible for what happened was Mugabe himself. Also, obviously he had key lieutenants, people like Emmerson Mnangagwa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain who Robert Mugabe was when Zimbabwe won its independence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> The man himself, I think it actually was in 81, he says, &#8220;What I was, I still am.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Robert Mugabe:\u003c/strong> I just don&#8217;t care what they say. As long as I know I&#8217;m right, so they can say anything in their papers, damage me in every way possible, as long as the people I lead are behind me, and the proof of what we are doing. That&#8217;s what matters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> I don&#8217;t think Mugabe, he has changed. I think Mugabe remains the man that he was in the 80s, authoritarian, brutal, with no ideology of his own. When we look at the man, he comes back from Ghana in the early 60s to show, he had been teaching in Ghana. Some of the people around the nationalist movement decide to invite him to a talk, and he talks before these people, and some of them were barely educated or semi-literate or with basic education, and they here is this guy who speaks nice English, who has two degrees or three degrees, at the time. He is invited to join, not because of espousing any revolutionary talk. It is more like, he is well spoken.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In fact, actually, the first role that he is given by the party is as a publicity secretary, which kind of shows you what his value at the time was, it was as a ventriloquist to channel whatever the party wanted him to say, and they wanted someone who called, say it in the nicest English possible, and Mugabe was the person.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, in the West, they talk about Mugabe as a good guy. Basically what they mean was he protected the interests of big capital, and which is why the British embassy, the Australian embassy, the American embassy were quiet about the killings in the, in the south, because while those killings were going on, Mugabe was protecting white capital or Western capital.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When Mugabe came to power in Zimbabwe early on, George H.W. Bush, who was the vice president at the time, called him a genuine statesman and then a decade later he was actually knighted by Queen Elizabeth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Ronald Reagan:\u003c/strong> It has been a great pleasure to have had the opportunity today to meet with Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of the Republic of Zimbabwe, as the first prime minister of Africa&#8217;s newest independent state, his wise leadership has been a crucial factor in healing the wounds of civil war and developing a new nation with new opportunities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What was the Western agenda in supporting Robert Mugabe? What did the West hope to gain from him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> For them, it was more of a case of: Who do we prefer? ZAPU, the Joshua Nkomo-led ZAPU had closer links with the ANC in South Africa, so what they didn&#8217;t want was for ZAPU to come into power in Zimbabwe, because what it will mean is to expose another front. Because, already, in &#8217;75, Mozambique had got independence, and ANC guerillas were already beginning to trickle into South Africa from Mozambique.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Robert Mugabe:\u003c/strong> Ah, of course we are not a front-line state, the struggle in South Africa is a national struggle for South Africans, and not one we should regard as Zimbabweans, as our own concern.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Peter Snow:\u003c/strong> You will not support an armed struggle in South Africa?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Robert Mugabe: \u003c/strong>No, we will not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> So imagine, if, say, ZAPU had come into power in 1980, it&#8217;ll mean another front, like a longer one, actually, has been opened in the war against apartheid South Africa. So, it was more, more of a case which is the better devil. As least they knew that ZANU has no close relationship with ANC, and it&#8217;ll be better to have Mugabe in power in Zimbabwe then to have the Joshua Nkomo-led party. I think the bigger prize really, was, South Africa and they wanted to prolong apartheid for as long as possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You raise this about the knighthood in &#8217;94, Bush describing him as a statesman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>George H. W. Bush:\u003c/strong> I met him many years ago and I visited his country and I&#8217;ve seen him several times since then, and I&#8217;m just so pleased that you&#8217;re with us. I&#8217;m glad to have you here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> So he was all these things when Western capital was safe. This is the Mugabe that is celebrated, especially among the progressive left in the States, among African Americans in the left, this is the Mugabe that they know. They don&#8217;t know the other Mugabe, the pre-2000 Mugabe who basically was killing black people and preserving the Western capital&#8217;s hegemony in Zimbabwe intact.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it has always been about power. It has always been about power. Even now in the negotiations, he still is insisting, &#8220;Can I be allowed to finish my term?&#8221; You know, even though, you know, he can barely keep awake, he can barely walk, there was no national interest in Mugabe continuing in power and this is what his lieutenants finally realized. This is what, as ordinary citizens, we realized this a long time ago that Mugabe&#8217;s continued stay in office is of no national interest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Now that you&#8217;ve had this very quick transition from Mugabe to Emmerson Mnangagwa, what are your biggest concerns about Mnangagwa running the country?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> We have elections next year, and these people who affected the coup have previously said that they won&#8217;t accept any president who didn&#8217;t participate in the war. So, the question which everyone has been asking here, is this: that do you think if another person who is not Emmerson Mnangagwa wins the election, are they going to accept the result? Or are they going to do that person what they did to Mugabe?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My second reservation has to do with the brand of economics that Mnangagwa&#8217;s regime might bring. I think he was preferred by the Chinese, which is why there are these whispers about, that the coup had sanctioned from the Chinese, because the general who led the coup, a few days before he led the coup he had been in China, and it is thought that he told them that this is what we&#8217;re planning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s difficult to verify that as the Chinese say, &#8220;We had no knowledge of this.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My point is this: In China, Mnangagwa was preferred in China, Mnangagwa was preferred in Britain, Mnangagwa was preferred in the West, because he was seen as good for business.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He wants to turn Zimbabwe back to its neoliberal ways of the 80s, which was easy for business to operate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However warped that the later Mugabe brought, the economic nationalism, given land to black people, basically destroying the monopoly of white people of the most protected land in Zimbabwe.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, if the early signs are anything to by, Mnangagwa might reverse the gains that the later Mugabe achieved for Zimbabweans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If elections were held, you know, tomorrow, what&#8217;s your sense of the political temperature in the country right now? Are people okay with ZANU-PF continuing on, albeit without Mugabe, or as you put it, Mugabism without Mugabe, or do you get a sense that there&#8217;s a wide belief that things need to radically change?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> If it were up to me, I would prefer a transitional arrangement, maybe of five years in which things are stabilized, because this country barely functions. And I don&#8217;t care if it is under Emmerson Mnangagwa or anyone else, because we have been having elections for the last, I don&#8217;t know, for the last seventeen years and nothing has changed, and people are tired, which is why, to an extent, people aren&#8217;t really concerned about politics, because you are more worried about where can I get money to go to work? You know, people don&#8217;t get paid at the end of the month. The country imports basically everything, including milk. The country doesn&#8217;t work at all. And if it were up to me, I would prefer a longer transitional arrangement in which the country is fixed and then a time in which we do security sector reform, because, if, against all odds, the MDC wins the elections next year, do you think the army is going to allow that when they removed their most revered figure? So, I think if we have elections, say today, or next week, or next month, or next year, Emmerson Mnangagwa is going to win.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> As we wrap up here are there any other points that you want to make or information that you think would be important for people to understand about this current situation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> It was a coup, despite the semantic quibbling, it was a coup, and Mugabe is gone, and people are really excited about the end. Not because they love the army, but because Mugabe had brought, you know, the crisis that began in 2000, brought the country to its knees, and people left to go to South Africa, to go to Botswana, to go to the States, to go to the UK, and families were destroyed, but people are excited that maybe this is the beginning of — and people have been calling it a new independence, that, they day that Mugabe resigned, people have been calling it the second independence, but, as people here say, Zimbabwe proves that there is no bottom. You keep on climbing the depths. And the new guy, people are willing to give him time to effect change and bring back the country back into the international community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to thank you very much for being with us and for offering your analysis. Thanks for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong> You are welcome.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That was a Zimbabwean journalist speaking to us from Harare. We granted him anonymity because of fears of reprisals.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Comedian Joe Pera Performs an Audio Drama From the NSA Newsletter\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> To close today&#8217;s show, we&#8217;re going to resume our series of dramatic reenactments of classified NSA documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You may not know it, but the NSA has its own secret online newspaper. It&#8217;s called SIDtoday, which stands for Signals Intelligence Directorate —Today!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the reason you&#8217;ve probably never heard of it is because SIDtoday contains classified information, and it&#8217;s published by the National Security Agency, and it&#8217;s available only to NSA employees who have security clearances.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Signals intelligence is the NSA shorthand for the type of information it collects by eavesdropping on electronic data across the world. SIDtoday has even had its own columnists, who, at the NSA, are regular agency staffers who wrote in their spare time. There&#8217;s been a columnist on grammar, another on office etiquette and there&#8217;s even been a columnist on the ethics of surveillance. These columns were among the documents leaked by Snowden and The Intercept continues to publish scores of them on an ongoing basis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In this installment of the series, we hear the story of an intern at the NSA who explains how his views of the agency differ from his college days when his only understanding of the NSA came from news articles and Hollywood movies. Here is, &#8220;Culture Shock: NSA from the Perspective of Summer Interns,&#8221; starring comedian Joe Pera.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music fades in.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Joe Pera:\u003c/strong> Being idealistic young interns we were excited about the big find we just made.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We were explaining the trail of SIGINT to our project lead, so eager to get it all out there we barely stopped for breath between words.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Who found this woman, Nadia Lnu, and she&#8217;s our target&#8217;s wife, so we&#8217;re trying to track his movements that way.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Redacted slowly began to smile as we spoke and finally asked, &#8220;Wait &#8230; what is her name?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We repeated, &#8220;Nadia Lnu, we&#8217;re not sure if that&#8217;s how you pronounce it, though.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Redacted burst out laughing and did not explain himself for what seemed like an eternity. We, the starry-eyed interns, just stared blankly at each other, wondering if this longtime NSAer had finally cracked. All we could say was, &#8220;What? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At last he said, &#8220;Spell it.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We responded hesitantly, &#8220;L-N-U.&#8221; That means &#8216;last name unknown.&#8217;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We fell quiet and we just hung our heads in embarrassment, knowing the story of a rookie acronym mistake soon be public knowledge to all of as to S2I6.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is just one of the example of how interns who come into the Agency motivated to soak up all the knowledge they can usually fall flat on their faces on more than one occasion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the very first day we arrived, we were hit with culture shock. For instance, when we stepped onto the solemnly quiet elevator, an older gentleman turned us and asked us if we were new.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Male Voice:\u003c/strong> “Hey, are you guys new?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JP:\u003c/strong> We answered “yes” — we must have been wearing our insecurities on our sleeves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All he replied was, &#8220;The only thing you need to know is we don&#8217;t talk in the elevators; and the extroverts look at other peoples&#8217; shoes.&#8221; All we could think was what have we gotten ourselves into?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As members of the Intelligence Analysis Program we expected to come to work this summer and have all the facts and figures readily available at our fingertips. We pictured data flying through cyberspace at supersonic speeds, helping us catch terrorists in the blink of an eye. Little did we know, you cannot simply hack into someone&#8217;s Facebook account and steal all their photo albums. Open source research is not as effortless as it seems in the outside world — especially when you are accustomed to the speed of your stylish MacBook at college.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We had imagined the formidable NSA police creating us every morning at the gate with their large submachine guns. So, there was no disappointment there. However, we also visualized workstations with some of the most advanced computer systems conceivable and high operating speeds, which turns out is not quite the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After viewing all the popular media that depicts NSA as the embodiment of Big Brother, we also did not expect regulations on targeting U.S. persons to be so strict. We kept waiting to hear about the ultra secret —a mythological level believed to be above top secret — product line that is permitted to target domestic communications.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some interns starting out at the NSA expected to be swallowed up by a spooky Big Brother organization, but, instead, we find that we are cheerfully welcomed into the government. And, to our surprise, the welcoming committee wasn&#8217;t wearing trench coats and sunglasses.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Music]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What we are trying to express is that the NSA can be an intimidating place for a young intern. We were initially overwhelmed by with a five-page long list of acronyms, a diverse of array of tools with baffling names, and a challenge to overcome assumptions about what we thought the Agency did. However, it is an also an extremely rewarding place to work. With ample movement through different offices and so many diverse targets, a college student thirsting for knowledge would be hard-pressed not to find something that interested them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In our opinion, it would be hard to get that rewarding feeling of defending our country anywhere other than the NSA. Sure, we might hide quietly in the background and never be famous, but that feeling of fulfillment from work is hard to replace. And, as redacted would say, who doesn&#8217;t love doing the &#8220;happy happy joy joy dance of discovery?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And that does it for this week&#8217;s show.

This week on Intercepted: Matthew Cole joins Jeremy for a discussion about their explosive report in The Intercept that Blackwater founder Erik Prince, a former CIA officer and Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame have been pitching a private spy operation to the White House and CIA to counter the “deep state” attempting to undermine Trump’s presidency. Radio show host, activist, and comedian Randy Credico has been hit with a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee investigating Trump and Russia. Roger Stone claims Credico was his secret liaison with WikiLeaks during the election. We ask Randy what this is all about and if he plans to appear before Congress in a week. Journalist Barrett Brown spent four years in prison stemming from his involvement with Anonymous, LulzSec and other hacker collectives who went after powerful private security companies. Barrett talks about the FBI’s campaign against him and offers a critique of WikiLeaks, Trump, and the state of the media in the U.S. Singer Amanda Palmer has a provocative new video out for a cover she did of Pink Floyd’s “Mother,” from the iconic album The Wall. The video was inspired by Trump’s pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. She talks about Trump, her music, and the fight to save net neutrality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>White House press corps:\u003c/strong> I believe Sarah Huckabee Sanders is walking out now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Tommy Wiseau as Johnny : \u003c/strong>Oh hi, Mark!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Major Garrett: \u003c/strong>Sarah, is the White House, or the president, at any level, considering, creating a global or regional spy network?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>J: \u003c/strong>(laughs) What a story, Mark.

Trump:\u003c/strong> Well, I feel badly for General Flynn. I feel very badly. He has led a very strong life and I feel very badly, Jon. I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life. I think it&#8217;s a shame.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This week, my Intercept colleague Matthew Cole and I published a story that we both agree is one of the most surreal that either of us have ever worked on. It details how the Trump White House is considering a set of proposals that have been developed by Blackwater founder Erik Prince, retired CIA officer John Maguire, with assistance from Oliver North, perhaps the most infamous figure in the Iran-Contra scandal. And the proposals are for services that would provide CIA director Mike Pompeo and the president with a global private spy network that would circumvent official U.S. intelligence agencies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We reported that these plans have been pitched to the White House as a means of countering deep state enemies in the intelligence community seeking to undermine Trump&#8217;s presidency. Now, obviously the creation of such a program raises the possibility that this effort could be used to create an intelligence apparatus to justify the Trump Administration&#8217;s political agenda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, there are often comparisons of Donald Trump to Richard Nixon and I definitely see that in the current landscape, but this particular story, it&#8217;s straight out of the Reagan era.

Like, Iran-Contra for Dummies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Oh and to top it all off, you have this involvement of Oliver North, an actual sort of antihero of the 1980s covert era I was just talking about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Lieutenant Colonel John W.

John!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Joining me now to discuss this is my colleague Matthew Cole. Together, we coauthored this story. Its title is, &#8220;Trump White House Weighing Plans for Private Spies to Counter “Deep State” Enemies.&#8221; Matthew, welcome back to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Matthew Cole:\u003c/strong> Thank you, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So lay out what you and I reported in The Intercept.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Well, a few weeks ago we started hearing first that Erik Prince was trying to reconstitute parts of his clandestine organization that he had run when he was working for the CIA and, in particular, on their assassination program. And starting from about roughly 2006 and 2007, and even beyond the Bush administration after the program been shut down, Erik maintained a team of deniable assets, as they would call it, but spies, people who had worked for the CIA, foreign nationals who were willing to kill or capture and could gather secrets mostly in the Middle East. And he started calling around and offering cash, with a &#8220;let&#8217;s get the band back together kind of line&#8221; and as that started trickling in, we started hearing from sources in Washington about something very oddly parallel, or similar, which was an effort by the Trump Administration to put together, you know, &#8220;off the books,&#8221; but a direct arm, intelligence unit that would work for the CIA director Mike Pompeo and for the White House and only for them, and would be essentially stove-piped, so that whatever intelligence was coming in would not go through the normal intelligence community wouldn&#8217;t be vetted, wouldn&#8217;t be seen, wouldn&#8217;t be shared.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s important to note that what they&#8217;re proposing as we understand it so far in and of itself is not illegal. Neither the privatization of it nor the idea that the president or the CIA can have their own intelligence unit as long as it&#8217;s properly briefed. There are a few checks and balances that go into it. They are minimal, but they are there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it&#8217;s not necessarily that it&#8217;s illegal, but what we started seeing was that Prince, along with a longtime associate and a former CIA officer John Maguire, and sort of the guy who seems to have brought the real special sauce for this mix, was Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame. And the three of them have — they&#8217;re all close friends, they&#8217;ve worked formally and informally together for years — and it appears that basically as soon as Trump took over the White House started to push for the idea of an intelligence unit that could be a check on the CIA. And that language is really a euphemism for their fear or their belief that the deep state, what is described to us as their read and description of the deep state, was really the intelligence community that was brought in, they claim, under the Obama administration. So really, it was a politically disloyal group of people working in the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, what have you, that this unit would be a check on them so that the president could have the intelligence he needs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so the real question that this raises is the potential for abuse. As we saw in the second Bush administration, before the war in Iraq, Cheney and the neocons set up a unit in the Pentagon that reported basically just to Cheney, and was cherry-picking the intelligence that the CIA, the military and the FBI had picked up to try to find an excuse and justification for the War in Iraq.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> For people that don&#8217;t recall that history, basically Cheney and Rumsfeld and a bunch of these neocons who cut their teeth during the Nixon era and really believed in this notion laid out in one of the Federalist Papers of the unitary executive, which basically said that the executive branch of government, i.e. the White House, should operate as essentially a dictatorship without any effective oversight when it came to the national security of the United States. And Dick Cheney himself, when he was a member of Congress, was the lead author of the minority report that actually said, &#8220;No, no, no, this wasn&#8217;t a scandal, this is a model for how we should be conducting our covert actions around the world.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Vice President Dick Cheney:\u003c/strong> Examples of Congress moving in and usurping presidential power and authority, and I think what we&#8217;ve seen over the last fifteen years is the development of that theme, of a more assertive Congress that no longer honors the traditions that are laid out in our report, in terms of the practices of the president&#8217;s preeminence in foreign policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If you sort of take away the salacious nature of the players: Erik Prince, John Maguire, the former CIA officer, and Oliver North is something that presidents throughout modern history have tried in one form or another.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;ve seen this before. There&#8217;s nothing new about this. In fact, one of the things that our sources pointed out, and it’s genuinely accurate, is that the model for having a unit that reported solely to the director of the CIA was something that William Casey did. And Casey, he was Ronald Reagan&#8217;s CIA director during the Iran-Contra affair, and, in fact, the people involved here all come, with the exception of Erik, who is younger than the rest of them, the people who sort of are populating this story and this effort all come from that era.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>John Maguire joined the CIA under Casey in the early 80s, and his first assignments at the Counterterrorism Center were in Central America against the Sandinistas. He was helping to mine the harbor there for the CIA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And the Sandinistas, of course, a leftist, populist movement that took power in Nicaragua and the Contras were a notorious right-wing death squad that was backed, financed, armed by the United States, in part through the illicit funds that were gained from selling weapons to Iran, and that&#8217;s where Oliver North comes into play: he was one of the key figures in selling these weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to the Contras in Nicaragua to be used in an attempt to overthrow leftist government. And they killed a tremendous number of innocent people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> This story has an enormous amount of history to unpack. What Trump has done is he&#8217;s surrounded himself in part with a bunch of 80s-era cold warriors. And in the 80s, it was the godless communists and then that shifted into post-9/11, you know, it took on a religious tinge under the Bush administration. We sort of have both of those things combined now under the Trump Administration, at least as we see this effort.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But one of the side shows is John Maguire and the company that he works for, Amyntor, or works with, which is trying to get a contract with the CIA to run this private network, were trying to do fundraising with Trump donors and Trump fundraisers, and they would bring them into the Trump Hotel in Washington and they would show a list and say these are the people that the &#8220;deep state&#8221; is surveilling.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Those names would include Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, almost always the name of the donor that they were trying to hit up, one person said it was a sort of amazing that the names on the list would change, but the only change would be which donor they were trying to hit up that day for money.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then they, what would they would do is say, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re doing this to help protect the president. Because if we don&#8217;t do this, there&#8217;s going to be a deep-state coup.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the story that they would trot out was that Donald Trump&#8217;s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, has a series of burner phones and they have an e-mail or something that purports to show his phone sending surveillance information, because he&#8217;s working — this story is a little convoluted, so bear with me — but working with a top NSA official, using the NSA to surveil Trump supporters in and outside of the administration, in and outside of the White House. And that that intelligence that&#8217;s gathered the surveillance is then sent electronically to a warehouse in Cypress. And they happen to uncover that that warehouse is owned directly by George Soros.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I know that that&#8217;s hard to believe, and we should state that, as far as we know, none of the evidence, there&#8217;s been no evidence that demonstrates that it&#8217;s all purported and we can&#8217;t verify the accuracy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re telling me that you don&#8217;t believe that George Soros is spying a random assortment of Trump donors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> You know, I can&#8217;t say, right? I want to just say that it&#8217;s possible, right? Anything is possible in this world. I think—I&#8217;m joking, of course, but I think that the picture I&#8217;m trying to paint here is that they&#8217;re bringing in these wealthy Trump donors and they show this list, they give this story and then they may or may not take you up to a room, one of the top higher floors of the Trump Hotel, and bring you into a room, what they call the &#8220;secure room&#8221; and to show you the kind of operation that that they need you to fund.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, they don&#8217;t just call it a secure room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Well, the thing is that the people who came out of it, often terrified by what they were seeing, called it the Tinfoil Room. We should point out, by the way, Jeremy, that as far as we know the walls themselves were not covered in actual tinfoil, but the idea was it was a Faraday cage and it was a place where they could make calls safely without the NSA spying on them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It reminds me of the Chris Rock routine about no sex in the champagne room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chris Rock:\u003c/strong> No matter what you think of what I&#8217;m saying, remember the one thing: There is no sex in the Champagne Room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> There&#8217;s no tinfoil in the Tinfoil Room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so the tinfoil room, as it was derisively called, was a demonstration of their operation. They did brag that they had more than one, that they could move it around, it was a secure communications room where they were safe from the prying surveillance of the deep state that was trying to take down the president. I will say that there&#8217;s a real cynical element to this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I just want to give people a sense of this. So, you have Erik Prince and John Maguire both have been around the world of private intelligence, contracting private military, they have a long working relationship together. In fact, John Maguire recently worked as a consultant for one of Erik Prince&#8217;s companies, Frontier Services Group. So they&#8217;ve worked together on many projects. They most recently were working together at Erik&#8217;s company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Maguire&#8217; company, Amyntor, is saying that Erik has no formal relationship to any of their proposals, that was the word that they used and Erik said that he&#8217;s played no role in any of these alleged proposals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what we know, both of us, from covering this for so long is that the world of military and particularly secret CIA contracting is intentionally murky. And both Erik Prince and John Maguire try to shield their actual involvement in a lot of what they&#8217;re doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it&#8217;s difficult to know who is actually running what aspects of this. But what we do know is that Erik Prince for years has had this network of spies, fixers, foreign intelligence agents, former U.S. intelligence personnel peppered around the world that he offers to potential clients, whether they&#8217;re businesses, foreign governments or the U.S. government, for use in whatever you want to do in Libya, or near Somalia, or in Israel, or Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And John Maguire, now, also has access to a kind of notorious network as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Right. This gets back to the cold warrior part. So, Maguire, who worked, came in in the 80s, worked under a very legendary and infamous CIA, senior CIA official named Duane Dewey Clarridge, who ran the Counterterrorism Center and was one of the key figures in the Iran-Contra scandal. And after he was out of the CIA, was out of the CIA for 30 years, he died last year, I believe. During the Obama administration he ran a private spying network that he was able to sell for a time to the Pentagon in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that network of spies eventually sort of dried up, when the story got exposed by the New York Times, the contract got killed. And his spies, although they moved around and they continued to work, he was constantly looking for money. And he died last year and John Maguire picked up that network.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, again, you&#8217;ll see the Ollie North connection there. Ollie North and Dewey Clarridge were very, very close friends.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And Clarridge also played a role in Iran-Contra.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Right. And you can&#8217;t understate how close these people are: they go to each other&#8217;s weddings, they are very friendly and they work together in the informal sense. Maguire and Ollie North have worked together informally, they are friendly. Erik and Maguire are friends.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> In fact, you had Oliver North and Maguire both attended in 2014 a very small reception celebrating Erik Prince&#8217;s third marriage. So we&#8217;re talking about people that are connected to each other, but also deeply connected to this particular administration. John Maguire was on Trump&#8217;s transition team. Erik Prince&#8217;s former colleague from the assassination program days under Bush, Michael Barry, is now running the division of the National Security Council that is in charge of the very kinds of programs that we&#8217;re reporting on here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Also, Erik was an informal adviser to the transition and, of course, last week Erik Prince testified behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee on the Russia-Trump investigation because it is reported that he was a backchannel between the Trump Administration and Putin in Moscow, through a meeting in the Seychelles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is a group of people who admire each other: Maguire, Prince, and Ollie North are all three big supporters of president Trump, were supporters of the campaign. This administration is an opportunity to come in and fix, in their definition, the intelligence apparatus in this country. And that includes essentially creating a mini-CIA for just the director of the CIA and the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The reason why this would be appealing to Trump or Mike Pompeo is because they appear to believe that there is a globalist conspiracy and that there are enemies within the deep state including at Mike Pompeo&#8217;s CIA, including at the NSA, including at the Pentagon, who are trying to undermine the Trump presidency and therefore, according to the theory, are not giving the president the real intelligence that he needs. This isn&#8217;t just about countering their influence; it&#8217;s the same idea that Cheney had when he said, &#8220;Look, I want my own intel operation, &#8217;cause I can&#8217;t trust those liberal think-tankers at the CIA.&#8221; So now you have Oliver North, who was used essentially as a source, said to lend credibility to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now most people don&#8217;t use the word Oliver North and credibility in the same sentence. The point also is Oliver North appears on Fox News all the time; the president is glued to Fox News. It&#8217;s like better than Sean Hannity — let&#8217;s wheel in Oliver North to sell this idea!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And really briefly: one of the concrete things that united them, Oliver North, Maguire, and Prince on this project was they all have long been concerned that the United States government was not taking seriously apprehending terrorist suspects who had conducted high-profile terrorist actions against the United States in the 1980s, when North was at his peak. And one of the specific plans that Maguire and his people and North were advocating was what&#8217;s called a rendition operation or kidnapping, some people would say, operation of two suspects who are at large, who are believed to have been involved with a major terrorist incident in the 80s that we&#8217;re not reporting for security reasons. But why don&#8217;t you explain that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, so, at some point this summer, people close to Maguire, and who work with Maguire, brought the White House the opportunity to grab two wanted individuals in the Middle East. And Maguire and Prince — separately, apparently — pushed for this this operation to be done and wanted White House approval. And as we understand it from sources from the intelligence community, the way it was received was sort of like a proof of concept, that they were trying to demonstrate their ability to use their spying network in the Middle East to catch terrorists. This was what they were proposing for in a larger manner as a rendition unit as one of the contract proposals that the CIA would pick up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, they would dispute that they were working together, but, ironically, as Maguire is in the White House trying to press this, Erik Prince is at that moment in time at that exact moment in time, elsewhere in the world rehiring former parts of his team from his assassination unit when he was working for the CIA. And now, flush with cash, he tells them, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a new organization. We&#8217;ve got money. We&#8217;re ready to go. This is the real deal.&#8221; And one of the first things that were doing is to go into the Middle East and grab the same two wanted terrorists that Maguire and his associates were offering to grab for the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s interesting because part of that narrative, too, is the FBI hasn&#8217;t done anything about this and we don&#8217;t believe that they are. We can get men in place to snatch these people, and, in fact, one of the sources in this story with direct knowledge of this said that the message essentially from this motley crew was, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to go snatch them. Where should we drop them off?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> &#8220;Who wants them?&#8221; We&#8217;re going to grab them, we&#8217;re going to grab them, who wants them?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The danger here is, and I think the thing that&#8217;s significant about that particular proposal, was the effort to locate these individuals, essentially to find them, was put in place without any authorization. Now, there&#8217;s no suggestion that any of the people who were offering to render them would do so without U.S. authorization. In fact, it seems clear that the reason why they brought this to the White House was they believe that Trump was sort of the last, best hope to grab these guys, that previous administrations, both Republican and Dems were not interested in getting involved in, bringing these people to justice. And so, they wanted to get the approval to do it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the first part of it, which was to find them to make it possible to really, physically do it. There is an enormous amount of intelligence work that&#8217;s to go into just getting up to that point. That was all done without any approval.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What I think it&#8217;s potentially scary here is that as far as we understand, the appeal to the president and to Pompeo, which is things can be done with very little government oversight, there&#8217;s no need to tell Congress. In fact, that you can&#8217;t tell Congress, you can&#8217;t tell the rest of the CIA, you can&#8217;t tell Washington because it may leak. And because what we can show is that we&#8217;ve got the stones to do it and the.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Part of the message that was being sent was that for years the intelligence community had become frankly weak and unwilling to go do things like bring people to justice and here was the opportunity to do it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The White House, in very interesting language, is categorically denying the veracity of this story. The CIA took a bit of a different position on it, though, which is interesting. They said, &#8220;Oh yeah, those proposals came to us from the White House, but there&#8217;s no traction to it.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean it&#8217;s really remarkable. The White House says, &#8220;We can find no evidence this ever came to the attention of anyone at the National Security Council.&#8221; They say: &#8220;The White House does not and would not support such a proposal.&#8221; But we also have a current U.S. intelligence official contradicting that, saying that the various proposals were first pitched at the White House before being delivered to the CIA. So, somebody doesn&#8217;t have their story straight.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know we reached out to a bunch of primary players, including the office of Vice President Mike Pence and listen to this statement from Mike Pence&#8217;s spokesperson: &#8220;There was no record of Erik Prince ever having met with or briefed the VP.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we don&#8217;t have evidence, we don&#8217;t have record. Like under Obama, when they were going to deny something, they would say, &#8220;This is just not true.&#8221; There would be no like, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t find any evidence that anything like this happened.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean, it is quite a curious series of denials and non-denials from everyone involved in the story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC:\u003c/strong> I think what you can see is a real rift and division between, for instance, the main body of the CIA versus the White House on this. And Mike Pompeo, according to sources really wants this idea and has lobbied the White House to get the approval necessary for it. That&#8217;s something in particular that the White House denies. We feel very strongly about that that it&#8217;s accurate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what that suggests is that Pompeo has this idea that the people under him, he can&#8217;t trust. He needs something extra and special just for himself. And I think one of the things that we&#8217;re going to see probably unfold is that there is a real division between the current director of the CIA. And, if it&#8217;s true that he might end up as the secretary of state, this might be an issue that comes up during his confirmation hearings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew, thanks for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>MC\u003c/strong>: Thank you so much, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Matthew Cole is an investigative reporter at The Intercept. You can read the story he and I wrote at theintercept.com. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;Trump White House Weighing Plans for Private Spies to Counter &#8216;Deep State&#8217; Enemies.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Roger Stone Claims Randy Credico Was His Secret Liaison With WikiLeaks and Julian Assange During the Election\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Last week the House Intelligence Committee, that&#8217;s conducting its own investigation of Trump and Russia in the 2016 election, sent a subpoena to a community radio host named Randy Credico. Now, I&#8217;ve known Randy for the better part of 20 years, and I know him as a dedicated activist against the very harsh Rockefeller drug laws in New York City and against racial injustice. He&#8217;s an anti-war activist and he spent a lot of time in the streets protesting Reagan&#8217;s dirty wars in Central America, for instance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Randy is also a standup comedian and back in the 1980s, he sort of found himself at a crossroads. Randy was a rising star in the comedy scene. He was political but he also had a kind of broad appeal because he was sort of a great impressionist. Randy got an invitation to appear on what was the single most important venue for stand-up comics at the time: The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ed McMahon:\u003c/strong> From Hollywood, The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson. This is Ed McMahon &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Randy ended up going on that show and he did a radical political routine, and when the routine was done, Johnny Carson did not invite him to the couch, which was a sign that you had made it. If Johnny said, &#8220;Hey, come, come over to the couch.&#8221; And Randy was never invited back on The Tonight Show again. Here&#8217;s a clip from that Tonight Show routine from the documentary about Randy&#8217;s life which is called, &#8220;60 Spins Around the Sun.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Johnny Carson:\u003c/strong> This is a young comedian. This is his first appearance on national television. Works in Hollywood, out here, at the Improvisation and would you welcome him, please, Randy Credico. Randy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Randy Credico:\u003c/strong> Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Thank you, Johnny. What a great introduction. As he said, I do political impressions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m doing great, you know, I&#8217;m doing the Reagan.&#8221; &#8220;The Jesse Jackson,&#8221; &#8220;Ted, Ted, Ted Kennedy and all this.&#8221; And there was a point where Freddy de Cordova had said, &#8220;This guy&#8217;s great, right? He&#8217;s coming back.&#8221; I thought that I would get the chair! I was doing that well. There was a point where I was going to get the chair.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC\u003c/strong>: I was doing very well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>60 Spins Around the Sun:\u003c/strong> What did you say that rubbed them the wrong way?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Uh, a couple of things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>60 Spins Around the Sun:\u003c/strong> Like what?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Jeaney Kirkpatrick, Jeane Kirkpatrick, she is a UN ambassador and she says a lot of interesting things. Matter of fact, if you examine some of those statements, you got to ask yourself seriously: did Eva Braun die in that bunker in 1945? (laughter and clapping)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Somebody said, &#8220;Whatever you do, don&#8217;t do Carson. I did like, a little bit of Carson as well.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC doing:\u003c/strong> As a matter of fact, he is the Tommy Newsom of the political scene, I would say. Ed —  (boos from the audience).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> That sealed my fate, no chair.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ed McMahon:\u003c/strong> Randy Credico.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Johnny Carson:\u003c/strong> Good stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: After this appearance on The Tonight Show, Randy Credico&#8217;s career went downhill and it never quite recovered. He poured himself into activism and he&#8217;s been very open about pouring himself into alcohol, and drugs, and having problems in his relationships. Believe me, he&#8217;s a surreal character and you should check out that documentary about his life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anyway, over the past year, Randy has been hosting a show on Pacifica Radio Station WBAI in New York. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;Live on the Fly with Randy Credico.&#8221; And his show gained somewhat of an international audience when Randy did a 12-part series on WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Randy did several interviews with Assange, he interviewed Assange&#8217;s mother and he interviewed people that have been working with Assange. And there&#8217;s no doubt that Randy is a passionate supporter and advocate for Julian Assange. Which brings us back to the subpoena that Randy received that by the way was signed by the chair of the Intelligence Committee Republican Devin Nunes. And here&#8217;s what this is about: Randy had former Trump adviser and still apparently Trump close friend Roger Stone on his radio series on Julian Assange. Roger Stone, of course, was one of Nixon&#8217;s henchmen and he is more famous in the current times for seeming to know ahead of time that WikiLeaks was going to be releasing emails about Hillary Clinton and John Podesta&#8217;s emails and the DNC communications. Roger Stone has a huge mouth and he openly bragged that he had this source close to WikiLeaks that was feeding him this information in advance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then, when Stone recently appeared himself before the House Committee, he reportedly told the Congress members on that committee that Randy Credico was in fact his secret source that was giving him information from Julian Assange. And then Randy got hit with this subpoena.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, to discuss this really bizarre, sordid tale is the man with the subpoena in his hand, Randy Credico. Randy, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Uh, Jeremy, it&#8217;s great to be here. Finally, I&#8217;ve been trying to get on the show for a long time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: And you and I have known each other for the better part of 20 years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Since you went to Albany with me in 1999.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I was a young reporter working for Amy Goodman and WBAI, and my first introduction to you, you were very close to the great radical lawyer, the late William Kunstler.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right. I was running his fund at that time. I was running the William Moses Kunstler Fund for racial justice, and our key project at that time was the repeal of the Rockefeller drug laws. And you went up there in the early days, you and Robert Knight, from WBAI, actually went up there and we had a huge rally.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and for people that don&#8217;t remember this is the Rockefeller drug laws are some of the harshest prison sentences doled out against nonviolent offenders including first time offenders, you know minor possession, charges, basically.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And for people that don&#8217;t know Randy Credico, if you had a loved one incarcerated under the Rockefeller drug laws, you absolutely knew Randi, he knew all of these women whose husbands, whose sons, whose family members were locked up under these and he would organize buses of family members and activists and others to go to Albany to protest against the Rockefeller drug laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> You know, we started out May 8, 1998, in front of the Rockefeller Center with about fifteen family members of those who were incarcerated. And kids — kids whose mothers were doing, you know, 20 years in prison that grew up without their mothers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Regina Stevens:\u003c/strong> I didn&#8217;t get any help from anyone until I met Randy Credico.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> This is Regina Stevens, her son under the Rockefeller drug laws: muscular dystrophy, full-blown muscular dystrophy, did ten years in a maximum security prison.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Regina Stevens:\u003c/strong> They have to dress him, put him on the toilet, take him off the toilet. They have to turn him every two hours while he sleeps. He&#8217;s no threat to anyone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> It started out there on the 25th anniversary of the Rockefeller drug laws and we were there for the next 6, 7 years until they were modified. And they were changed that year, they were changed again — not enough, to my satisfaction — but they made it retroactive so a lot of people who were still behind bars were able to get some relief.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok, let&#8217;s transition and start talking about WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Oh no (laughs).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So let&#8217;s start the beginning: you did, what was it, a 12-part series?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Yes, it started out as a, this is April 2nd, Assange had called me —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> April 2nd, 20 — ?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> 2017. 2017. That&#8217;s this year. Yes. I did it this year. I had him on the show, August 26, something like that, of 2016. I had him on, along with Cindy Sheehan. And then I didn&#8217;t get him back on for 6 months, 7 months. He finally called me up. He finally called me up and said, &#8220;I would like to do the show.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> The most accurate source in news, Julian Assange. Welcome back to the show, Julian.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Julian Assange\u003c/strong>: Good day, Randy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s good to have you back on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> And in the following week, I began building a series. I didn&#8217;t know how long it was going to go, and it went right up to his five-year anniversary inside the Ecuadorian anniversary, which is, I think, June 17.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And what was the point of the series?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> The point the series was it was called Julian Assange&#8217;s Countdown to Freedom, it was a hook. The reason why I continued with it was the crowd was growing, I was getting this international audience of people from Pakistan, from Russia, I shouldn&#8217;t say that, but you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And you were interviewing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I was interviewing everybody, interviewing people like William Binney and Ray McGovern and then his mother came on at the very end. And she would only do my show because she listened to it for seven or eight weeks and she finally funny came out of the woodwork and said, &#8220;I trust you. I&#8217;ll do your show.&#8221; And she did it twice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I know that for a mother to be separated from her son like this it must be grueling and difficult road to hoe on a daily basis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Christine Ann Hawkins:\u003c/strong> It is. I, I, it&#8217;s difficult. [indistinct] I don&#8217;t think, it&#8217;s very hard to put into words this experience that we&#8217;re going through over the last seven years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> He came on at the very end. I really started getting into it, once I got to know the story here about WikiLeaks and so that show just took off. Roger Stone was on one of those first 10.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Why?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Because he was such a supporter of WikiLeaks. I was, every week I&#8217;m trying to juggle a show. Right? Craig Murray was on three or four times. Craig Murray, the former ambassador to Uzbekistan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> British ambassador.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> And he&#8217;s made some statements out there that that are controversial but very smart guy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, just to be clear, Craig Murray claims that he was the intermediary between WikiLeaks on the one hand and whoever it was — their line is that &#8220;whoever it was that leaked the DNC emails gave them to Craig Murray and Murray then gave them to WikiLeaks and that it wasn&#8217;t about Russia at all.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I heard that, I heard him say that but I never brought that up to him on the series.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Good, great journalism there, Randy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> No, I didn&#8217;t. I really did not because I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t want to talk about that. But he did talk about everything else. He talked about Assange&#8217;s association, his association with Assange. It&#8217;s all there! I had him on like three times.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When did you receive a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Just last week when I got back from London. I got the letter on November 9th. I went to London on the 11th and 12th, all the way to the 17th, and then I came back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What were you doing in London?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I was covering a hearing at the high court trying to get documents between the Crown Prosecutor services and the Swedish prosecutor that took place, that they had hidden from an Italian journalist, that showed communications that they kept the Swedish prosecutor from interviewing Julian Assange, because that might exonerate him early. They didn&#8217;t want them in London to interview him, because they would lose their pretext to keep him there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is on the allegations that Julian sexually assaulted women in Sweden.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right, and they could&#8217;ve come in and they could have had that interview, but they did not want — and so those, that was the basis of that they&#8217;re trying to get documents that would prove that they colluded with the SPA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So this was roughly a month ago, did you meet with Julian while you were there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Yes. Yes. That&#8217;s already public, so I can say that. Twice, I met with him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok. When you got this subpoena, what did the subpoena say that they wanted to question you in connection to?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Well the first, I sent you the letter —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well no one can see that on this show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I understand that. But it was about Russiagate! I mean, it doesn&#8217;t say Russiagate! Anything, all matters Russian with the involvement with the 2016 election, and preserve documents, preserve this, preserve that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, just before deadline, my lawyer, Marty Stolar sent them an email saying that I refuse to voluntarily give them testimony.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, a week later, low and behold there is a subpoena to show up on the 15th. The last day before they go to break the following day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Are you — are you gonna show up?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I don&#8217;t know. We don&#8217;t know. I have like four or five lawyers right now that are working on this, and maybe one big organization, civil rights organization, still kind of building. Marty&#8217;s still kind of the lead lawyer on this, I&#8217;m getting advice from others as to what to do on this date.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok, now, clearly one of the events that precipitated, if not caused you to be hit with this subpoena, is that Roger Stone gave your name up to the committee and said, &#8220;This person that I&#8217;ve been talking about, tweeting about, my secret squirrel into Julian Assange&#8217;s world, and how I knew that things were going to be coming out was Randy Credico.&#8221; Right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I think that&#8217;s the reason why. But I haven&#8217;t seen anybody&#8217;s testimony, but I don&#8217;t know! That could be what they put out, what they leaked out there. But maybe it&#8217;s something else. Maybe they want to have information with my source: Julian Assange.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Hold on. Let&#8217;s get to that in a second. Let&#8217;s just talk about Roger Stone for a moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Roger Stone, then, when it came out and people started saying, &#8220;Oh, this journalist/comedian, Randy Credico was Roger Stone&#8217;s source.&#8221; Then reporters who had been covering this got text messages from Roger Stone saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I lied to you. I was trying to protect my source, Randy Credico.'&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Is Roger Stone telling the truth when he says that you were his conduit to Julian Assange?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m not at liberty to say exactly what Roger Stone did, other than what he has said on my radio show at this point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Which was?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I can&#8217;t conclusively say — he was on my radio shows many times. He got me Gary Johnson on my radio show, he talked to my radio show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The libertarian candidate for president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> The libertarian candidate, and, like I said, he&#8217;d been on my show. I got a lot of heat for this, I had him on, this goes way back to when I had the morning show before David Rothenberg on Saturdays. I had him on, I had Wayne Barrett.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok, people can, people can look at that archive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok, how about this question? Is Roger Stone being truthful when he says that you were his conduit to advance information from WikiLeaks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> This is the kind of question I&#8217;m going to get next week.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well this is a practice run.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Yes. Well, this practice run is: I have to say I stand on my First Amendment grounds, or I stand on my Fifth Amendment rights, here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So you&#8217;re making me play the role of Adam Schiff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Yeah, you&#8217;re Adam Schiff!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Would you have had access to advanced information to give Roger Stone?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Do you think I could? May I, may I ask you a question?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Go ahead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Would you trust me with any — you&#8217;ve known me, and you know my reputation. Would you trust me with information?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Ok.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well it depends: if it was information strategizing on how to get people out of prison who are there for totally outrageous first-time drug possession, yeah, I would trust you to have a secret strategy meeting among activists for how are we going to do this?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I would not trust you with, &#8220;Hey, by the way, we&#8217;ve got this guy, his name is so and so and he&#8217;s going to give us secret information.&#8221; I would not tell you that. But I want you to answer that question.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I think you can come up with some kind of conclusion, if you were to look through all the dates and go through all the material, the answer to that question — but the fact of the matter is since I am unable to talk about my communication Roger Stone and Julian Assange, other than our conversation. This is by my lawyer. I asked him, if you asked me that question, what can I say? He said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Has your lawyer also been sending out your tweets?

Look at Roger Stone&#8217;s tweets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m going to look at your tweets. June 17th, 2016, you tweeted, &#8220;Assange to drop coup de grace hammer on career criminal Clinton.&#8221; How did you know that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I said that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> What day was that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> June 17, 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> June 17. Well, that was something that I would just say. When did it come out? That was, that was based on his tweets. That was based on his tweets, OK! He&#8217;s the one that said that he&#8217;s going to jail, that he had enough material. Just take a look at his tweets. Mine are based, back then, on his tweets. I didn&#8217;t know, I didn&#8217;t even know Assange on June 17.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So June 17, you tweeted that. July 27, at 10:30 —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I must&#8217;ve been drinking back then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You must&#8217;ve been drinking. &#8220;WikiLeaks begins to release tens of thousands of DNC emails.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Well they probably had already done that, right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So did you know anything about this information in advance?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> How would I know that? How would I know about that? That, there, the June — That&#8217;s even news to me that I put that out. Must&#8217;ve been one of my drinking binges, but if you take a look at his tweets, prior to that, that I would extrapolate based on his tweets what was coming out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> On June 17, 2016, had you ever had any communication with Julian Assange?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> No. No.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So you were not in touch with Assange?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> No. No. I had him on my show, August 25.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> OK, so clearly what you&#8217;re saying then, it&#8217;s safe to say, June 17, 2016, you had no more foreknowledge of anything WikiLeaks was going to be doing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> When did they come out?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> July 22, 2016. A month later.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> They did. Nothing came out by then. So that&#8217;s very mysterious to me. That I would have that, that I would put that out. Then when would they even need to go to Roger Stone, when I predicted before him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well I —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Maybe he was my backchannel. Maybe Stone was my backchannel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Maybe Stone was yours. I know at that point already that it had been clear that Assange was going to be releasing documents about Hillary Clinton. I&#8217;m not sure that we knew anything specific.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You tweeted that two days after WikiLeaks had already started releasing information so when you said, &#8220;Assange to drop coup de grace hammer on career criminal Clinton,&#8221; what you&#8217;re saying is that they had just published this stuff and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I make wild tweets, ok? Mine are as irresponsible as the president at some time, and Roger Stone at some time. Depends on what time of the morning it is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So it&#8217;s clear then, and you&#8217;ve stated clearly, you wouldn&#8217;t have had any foreknowledge, you hadn&#8217;t yet met.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> June 17, all I can say is that my conversations off the radio show with Julian Assange, I&#8217;m not at liberty to talk about. That tweet obviously came after what he had put out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. When did you first communicate with Julian Assange?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> On August 26th, by phone, on my radio show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So that was that was the first communication you ever had with him?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Any direct communication was on my radio show?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok.

There were two people from Catalan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well they also have your photo, that was taken outside of the embassy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s my photo.

Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> They have that photo, but don&#8217;t they have their own photos?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, I’m sure.

He was just there all day long.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Doing nothing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What I&#8217;m trying to get to here, and I understand that you&#8217;re under subpoena, this isn&#8217;t a light matter. I mean you are under subpoena, you are going to be —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m going to be surprised with things like that, that you just surprised me with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well you better get your ducks in a row if you are actually going to talk to that committee. They&#8217;re going to go through your entire timeline.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> My entire life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So here&#8217;s the most important part —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I have met with the guy three times. I said that. yes. With Mr. Assange, I consider him a friend. I consider him now a close, I really got to lie him. I know he&#8217;s controversial, people on both sides, on the left and right, large elements that don&#8217;t like him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> To me, there are two very relevant to ask you regarding this specifically. One is: Is Roger Stone being truthful when he describes you as his source?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I can&#8217;t characterize Roger Stone&#8217;s — I can&#8217;t talk about Roger Stone&#8217;s testimony because I don&#8217;t know what it is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You wrote to me and said, “He&#8217;s a fucking liar.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I did?!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Well, he, I mean, in the past he has lied about me. He said that I was the guy who called up Eliot Spitzer&#8217;s father at 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning in 2007. Of course that was proven to be wrong. So I&#8217;m saying that he has lied in the past. I don&#8217;t know what his testimony! I haven&#8217;t seen his testimony!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Not his testimony, Randy! What he said after his testimony that he&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t want to snitch Randy out, but guys, he&#8217;s my source.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s what he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> This is going to have a beautiful ending, this story here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What do you mean?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> OK. This story is going to have a beautiful ending. I cannot discuss here. I&#8217;d like to say conclusively but unable to at the behest of my attorneys, and my lawyer says, &#8220;just take the Fifth Amendment.&#8221; I can only take that if I take it now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I get it and I respect that. I mean, I&#8217;ll just make my own comment about this then. Which is that the way I see this is even if you knew that WikiLeaks was going to be releasing more emails, how on earth is that criminal? I guarantee you that there are many journalists around the world who did have advance knowledge that WikiLeaks was going to publish things. And my point is: so what?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right. I&#8217;m sure, a lot did. I&#8217;m sure —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The issue, is were you being used as a backchannel to Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> You know, let&#8217;s take in the case of Stefania Maurizi, who has worked with Glenn Greenwald and has worked with Snowden.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re talking about the Italian journalist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Very close friend of mine. Now she probably gets advanced information before its released.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, so what I&#8217;m saying is, if you&#8217;re working in a journalistic capacity, and someone says, &#8220;Hey, this thing is coming down, it&#8217;s going to be published on this date, be on the lookout for it.&#8221; I get like that all the time from a variety of actors in all these stories.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The question, though, that I think is different than that is did you cross a line, a journalistic line, because you are claiming First Amendment protection as a journalist in some of this, where you then are knowingly giving information to someone who is in direct contact with Donald Trump about emails that are going to be —?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> (yelling) WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. That are going to be coming out. That&#8217;s the issue. Is not whether or not you as a journalist got it, is that did you knowingly give it to someone who you reasonably can assume would tell the president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know: If Roger Stone doesn&#8217;t tweet that out, would Julian Assange not put the stuff out. All right? Was that going to come no matter who knew about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah. Of course, it was going to come, but the point, and I think this is why they&#8217;re looking at it is because they&#8217;re up this whole collusion thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And their assumption, which has not been proven on a technical level, is that WikiLeaks knowingly was disseminating emails that had been obtained by Russian hackers and so the point they&#8217;re getting at is if Roger Stone had advance knowledge of something that was essentially a Kremlin PSYOP to try to tilt the election, then that would be relevant to this investigation. That&#8217;s the point they&#8217;re making.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right. Right. Well, let them prove that point. They have to prove that point. And I&#8217;m just telling you, right now, unfortunately I am not at liberty, and I think I told you this coming in, I&#8217;m not at liberty to talk about any conversations I had with Roger Stone or with Julian Assange outside of our radio show which is public.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Ok.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Wouldn&#8217;t you be doing the same thing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t be sitting here being interviewed by me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Right. Oh, you&#8217;re tough. You&#8217;re tougher than Chuck Todd. No, I&#8217;m kidding. I&#8217;m joking though.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Whoa! That&#8217;s really low.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> No, I&#8217;m not joking, you are tougher than Mike Wallace. All right? You&#8217;re tougher than Mike Wallace. All right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Given that you&#8217;ve spent all this time interviewing Assange and supporters of WikiLeaks and family members of Julian Assange, what is your assessment of this entire Russia investigation into Donald Trump as it relates to WikiLeaks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Well, let me just say this about Donald Trump: I do not like Donald Trump. I have been against Donald Trump way back with the Central Park joggers. I despise him and I would do nothing to facilitate his victory. And I did not — look it was a sad day for me. I was so depressed, but I was going to be depressed if Hillary won!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But obviously things are very bad right now. My point is there are other ways to get to, to get to him legally. And to use this as the prop, to use this as a tire jack, this Russiagate thing on Trump is wasting a lot of time. Look what just got passed: this huge trickle-up tax bill that&#8217;s going to be signed and everything else that is going on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> If you do have to show up down there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I do have to show up!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So you are — ?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> I do have to show up. I mean, if not, I&#8217;m held in contempt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: But why don&#8217;t your lawyers ask if it can be a public hearing? Say, my client will appear but the public has to be allowed into it, none of this closed door stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s a good question, because why is it that the IC guys like Clapper and Hayden, they get to do it publicly, but the people who are witnesses, people who are being charged, gotta do it privately.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Erik Prince, the head of Blackwater, last week.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Yes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> He testified behind closed doors. All we get is the trickle out of what witnesses say happened inside of the room.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Whatever they release, because there are no reporters in there. Whatever they release.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. So you could be in that situation then, where they&#8217;re going to be saying you&#8217;ve said something, and —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> And you can just take it out of context, and you can drop it out, so I would insist that it would be public. That&#8217;s one thing. And, I have no idea what my response is going to be. Will I? Will I go behind closed doors and testify? Probably not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s my inclination.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Randy Credico, thank you for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RC:\u003c/strong> Thank you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Randy Credico is an activist, a comedian, a radio host and now the recipient of a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee as part of the Trump Russia investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Barrett Brown on the FBI’s Campaign Against Him and His Critique of WikiLeaks, Trump, and the State of the Media in the U.S.\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We&#8217;re going to continue on with this WikiLeaks theme and talk to a young journalist who was arrested and imprisoned on federal charges stemming from his alleged role in the hacking of the private intelligence company Stratfor. I&#8217;m talking about Barrett Brown. Last year, Barrett was released from prison but while he was still locked up he managed to win the very prestigious National Magazine Award for his prison commentaries that were published by The Intercept. Barrett has been a longtime advocate for hackers, a supporter of WikiLeaks and Anonymous, and he of course has paid a very personal price for this after he went after very powerful private companies in his reporting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Barrett&#8217;s ordeal began in May of 2011 when the hacking team LulzSec targeted the internet security firm HBGary. LulzSec released thousands of internal company emails and they also published the personal communications of HBGary&#8217;s CEO, Aaron Barr. They took control of some of his social media accounts and they exposed all sorts of personal information about him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Barrett Brown reported on that hack, and then began crowdsourcing the analysis of these thousands of hacked documents, and he did this in a journalistic collective that he created called Project PM. That group was formed to report on private government contractors that are working on cyber security, surveillance, intelligence. They were also investigating FBI involvement with these intelligence firms that were targeting activists and journalists and others.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>From some of those hacked HB Gary documents, we learned that there was a plan by the company to try to destroy the reputation of WikiLeaks and also of my fellow Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald, who, of course, then would go on to report the NSA leaks from Edward Snowden.So basically, HBGary was trying to destroy people exposing companies like HBGary, or entities like the NSA or the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Later in the same year, the hacking collective AntiSec, operating under the broad banner of Anonymous, hacked the intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting, Inc — better known as Stratfor. AntiSec wrote on the company&#8217;s home page after they took control of it, &#8220;Merry Lulzmas&#8221; and then they proceeded to dump an enormous trove of exposed communications from Stratfor. We&#8217;re talking emails, both internal emails and from clients, internal documents, personal usernames, emails, passwords, credit card numbers, on and on. Barrett Brown was reporting on these hacks and also trying to help the hackers sift through what exactly they had.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The FBI had already been monitoring Barrett going back to at least the HBGary hack. They sent search warrants, they raided his apartment, they raided his mother&#8217;s apartment and after Barrett posted a series of YouTube rants against the FBI and its agent Robert Smith where he threatened to publish his personal information among other things, Barrett was arrested in September of 2012, and the government threw the book at him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At one point, Barrett Brown faced more than one hundred years in prison. In the end, almost the entire case against him fell apart and Barrett ended up accepting a plea agreement and received a five-year prison sentence. He&#8217;s sort of been a free man since last November, though he was briefly arrested for giving an interview. Let&#8217;s hope that doesn&#8217;t happen this time as Barrett Brown joins me now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Barrett, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Barrett Brown:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Give an overview of how you see this moment that we&#8217;re in right now in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> I think the most important part of this is that this illusion, this bipartisan, sort of center-moderate cozy illusion that our institutions are generally sound, that the authority of the United States government and its institutions is just, and that this is a republic that can sustain itself as a moral enterprise over the next few decades: That&#8217;s all been sort of torn asunder. And that&#8217;s good, because the things that were happening were already in play, we&#8217;ve already had broken institutions before Trump arrived, he just sort of accelerated quite a bit of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that does help get us to a point where we can start talking seriously about what we&#8217;re going to do about all this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;ve had your own issues with law enforcement. In fact, it very clearly seems like they were trying to completely destroy your life. When you see liberal commentators or the press sort of lionizing Robert Mueller or the FBI, what&#8217;s your sense of where that&#8217;s coming from and what do you think of it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> You know, I saw some of those hearings last year when I was still in prison, when Comey was first brought before Congress to talk about the Hillary Clinton best occasion and watched with other federal prisoners as these congressmen on either side, on the different points there, whenever he was apparently in their corner, you know, just sat there and just praised the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Jason Chaffetz:\u003c/strong> I want to thank Director Comey for being here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Elijah Cummings:\u003c/strong> For your independence, for your integrity, and your honesty.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Stacey Plaskett:\u003c/strong> Director Comey is a man of impeccable integrity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. JC:\u003c/strong> I have the greatest admiration for the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Rep. Jim Cooper:\u003c/strong> And I&#8217;m thankful at this moment that you have such a lifetime record of speaking truth to power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> Obviously, that&#8217;s all nonsense. And, it&#8217;s nonsense that has somehow maintained itself, you know, sort of building up again after &#8217;75, &#8217;73, &#8217;74, when COINTELPRO came out and the FBI&#8217;s actual conduct was laid bare. It&#8217;s unfortunate that that occurs and of course you&#8217;re always going to have this disingenuousness among both parties and among sort of different kinds of tribalism, partisans and just people who don&#8217;t know any better.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The FBI, obviously, in its actual effect, as we can see from actually looking at its cases and how it handles itself does have a contingent of people that are indeed relatively straightforward relatively virtuous law enforcement officers. It also has a very large contingent of people who are not, of people who do engage in due process violations and crimes essentially in the course of their duties.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then there&#8217;s a contingent that is sort of an enforcement arm, a sort of amorphous enforcement arm against activists and against unpopular political entities. And that&#8217;s obviously where we came into the picture, when they started coming after us at the same time they&#8217;re going after Glenn Greenwald, for instance, and WikiLeaks and left-wing groups that are going — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and all of that came out, the DOJ was running these bizarre criminal operations that were exposed, that Palantir and HBGary and some of these other companies were involved in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It doesn&#8217;t really do anything. It doesn&#8217;t change the fundamental perception of the average television presenter, even some of the more cerebral columnists, it just doesn&#8217;t take. And so, one way or the other they have no idea what the FBI really is and they shouldn&#8217;t be explaining it to the rest of us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I want to get your take on the kind of evolution or devolution, depending on how you look at it, of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. What have you made of WikiLeaks and Assange&#8217;s role in 2016, the publication of the DNC documents, the emails, the role that Assange and WikiLeaks played in the 2016 election?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB: \u003c/strong>I was a very visceral, very vicious partisan of WikiLeaks going back to 2009 and 2010, which I was one of the early bloggers and commentators to not just write about it but to really strongly praise it. Thereafter, when I became more of an activist and got involved with Anonymous and then my own group, Project PM, a number of our operations were related to WikiLeaks in some way, including several that were intent on defending WikiLeaks from its attackers here in the U.S. and elsewhere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I was pursued by the FBI starting right after, you know the HBGary thing had come out, when I was still very aggressively going after the executives at these companies, like Booz Allen Hamilton, who had sort of gotten away with this, hadn&#8217;t even really made it into the media narrative and I was happy to do it because I was very strong believer in what WikiLeaks was doing. I thought it was a very important early example of what the internet can do in terms of new forms of collaboration, leveraging communications in order to combat larger entrenched institutions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, and then obviously there was always criticism and some of it legitimate of WikiLeaks or Assange personally, and I was comfortable with that. And then when I went to prison, obviously, I had to follow these things a little more loosely and then of course during the election heard that the DNC deal and all that. I was never opposed to them releasing the DNC emails. That&#8217;s an entirely appropriate thing for them to do, it didn&#8217;t matter to me where they came from. Again, it&#8217;s not WikiLeaks&#8217; job to determine if it&#8217;s being provided to them for, you know, a political purpose. That&#8217;s not the point of WikiLeaks, nor should it be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What crossed the line for me, starting a few months ago, was, first of all Assange, claiming that Trump had been vindicated in his original claim that Obama had wiretapped him during &#8220;the very sacred election process.&#8221; Just extraordinary disingenuous stuff he was posting, and I took issue with it publicly for the first time. I really criticized Assange in public, and I should note that he and I have never directly spoken. We&#8217;ve passed along messages here and there, just vague things, and he&#8217;s spoken about me during my case and all that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I am a beneficiary of the Courage Foundation, which he and Sarah Harrison originally founded, although he&#8217;s no longer on the board, but it was, so that was a big break and that&#8217;s representative of a larger fracture in this movements. Obviously, there is still a number of people who, even after the Trump Jr. exchange became public, even knowing that WikiLeaks had publicly claimed in 2007, on a Reddit question and answer session that they were not colluding with the Trump Administration or any political party.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even after some of these more recent decisions he&#8217;s taken to make other claims that are just not viable, some of which he has even had to delete because they were so clearly wrong, there&#8217;s people who will still defend him and still are defending him, and the movement has to, and when I say the movement, I mean this sort of larger, sort of internet-driven, anti-establishment movement. Anti-institutional movement, has to make some serious decisions about what kind of movement we really are, if we&#8217;re going to be a tribal movement, just another entity on the playground, or if we&#8217;re going to have actual, visible, robust ethics surrounding what we do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, there are some very radical Assange and WikiLeaks partisans, who sort of argue, well, the Don, Jr. DMs, that&#8217;s just evidence of the kind of fifth dimensional chess that Julian was playing with the Trump people. And I sort of viewed it more in the same way that I saw one of your comments, I sort of look at that and I say, &#8220;Why on earth are you assisting what is essentially a fascist force or a fascist-enabling force that, you know, has taken power in this country.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> They&#8217;ll find several different things, depending on who they are. Some of them, like Kim Dotcom, openly support Trump and think it&#8217;s totally appropriate for him to have done that. There&#8217;s others who will not acknowledge that this was actually supporting Trump, and they&#8217;ll tend to address one or two portions of a conversation that has really six or seven actual aspects to it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The most important aspect of this, the most critical one is Assange saying that the &#8220;kicker&#8221; of this scheme whereby Trump Junior would provide Trump&#8217;s taxes to WikiLeaks, you know, would allow him to change the &#8220;perceptions&#8221; about you know him being &#8220;pro-Trump and pro-Putin,&#8221; which he goes on to claim is a canard put forth by the Hillary Clinton people, here he is talking to the Trump people and eventually giving them advice about contesting election and earlier providing them information about a political action committee that he wrongly thinks was also a pro-Iraq political action committee, and denouncing it as libel, that he&#8217;s pro-Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond that, this thing about him giving the tax returns to Assange. But WikiLeaks does not, in my memory, release documents that have been given to them by the institution in question. There would be really no point for that. WikiLeaks has always been something where a leaker provides information about an institution and forces transparency on it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So presumably and it&#8217;s pretty clear in this conversation it would not be an exception, obviously it wouldn&#8217;t change perceptions about Assange or Trump if it was known, if he comes out and said, &#8220;Oh yeah, the Trump people gave me this and we&#8217;re releasing it.&#8221; It would serve no purpose. So clearly this was going to be a fraud against everyone, in which they were going to sort of pretend that they had gotten it via their usual means. And so, you know, that&#8217;s the kind of thing that people are now having to defend. They&#8217;re also having to defend anything to do with the Trump Administration or every new revelation about Trump and Russia. They&#8217;re having to defend Flynn and claim that this thing about Flynn is some item of overreach by the FBI, which is actually one of the few incidents that I&#8217;m familiar with where the FBI has not really overreached. That&#8217;s the path that we go down when we start choosing a leader and following him down whatever path he takes, which, and the path is also secret. So.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What first got you on the FBI&#8217;s radar, what kind of work were you doing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> Well, after having been a journalist for a while, I had grown disenchanted with mere journalism and I wanted to have more of a direct effect on the things I was investigating. And I got involved Anonymous during the Arab Spring, during Tunisia, because there&#8217;s a lot of Anons were Tunisian nationals themselves who were heavily involved in that revolution. During this Arab Spring assistance effort, we found that we had been spied upon by a man named Aaron Barr of HBGary Federal, and some of Anonymous hackers went in the next day and took over his servers and took all of his emails and we began our investigation into him and that yielded, within a couple days, this team Team Themis conspiracy, in which these companies, including Palantir, run by Peter Thiel, were engaged in this extraordinarily lawless and indefensible conspiracy against journalists who supported WikiLeaks, that&#8217;s where Glenn Greenwald came in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>WikiLeaks itself, donors to WikiLeaks, and then separately against enemies of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which had also hired these companies. And this had all been done through a major law firm, Hunton &amp; Williams, and with the acquiescence and really the instigation of the DOJ, and went to Congress, Congress was going to investigate, that got shut down by Lamar Smith, the Republican who gets money from these companies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, I reengineered Project PM, which was my group originally, turned it into a makeshift crowdsourced investigation, and that was around the time when the FBI started getting secret search warrants, forming, going to grand juries and then eventually raided me the following year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain what HBGary is and why they would have been interested in spying on you or WikiLeaks, or Anonymous, or Glenn Greenwald?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> Well, HBGary is one of the many companies that have kind of come into fruition the last, since 9/11, really under the radar of the public and of the press, even the technical press, and these are companies that we call intelligence contractors, or they call themselves that, usually, or security contractors, and they provide different services and products to the U.S. government, to governments abroad including dictatorships like Bahrain. They occasionally, like in this instance, engage in espionage and sort of counterintelligence, disinformation and oftentimes criminal hacks that are of the sort that people in Anonymous actually get arrested for all the time, and they do it without any consequences, even when they get caught. And so, in this case, in addition to his paid proposal that they were putting together about how they could go after WikiLeaks and Glenn Greenwald, they were also separately going to go after Anonymous on behalf of Booz Allen Hamilton, which ended up having some other project that we never figured out what it was. But we had e-mail exchanges between Aaron Barr of HBGary and one of the vice presidents of Booz Allen Hamilton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Back then, and there was a report that Endgame Systems, which is another one of these firms that was in Team Themis, had written a report on WikiLeaks and Anonymous, actually a very accurate report compared to the kind of things you saw back then. And, it was very clear from that that Anonymous was taken pretty seriously as a threat to these kinds of people back then. And rightfully so, since, of course, we ended up taking down quite a few of them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Stephen Colbert:\u003c/strong> Anonymous took down Barr&#8217;s website, stole his emails, deleted the company&#8217;s backup data, trashed his Twitter account, and remotely wiped his iPad (laughter). Anonymous then published all of Barr&#8217;s emails, including one from his wife saying, &#8220;I will file for divorce&#8221; and Barr&#8217;s World of Warcraft name Sevrynsten. (laughter) That&#8217;s right. They ruined both his lives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> There was this sort of broad, amorphous collusion between different government agencies and different ex-government people and some of these companies, all sort of figuring out ways to stymie Anonymous. And then later, of course, we found more about that when the Edward Snowden documents came out, and GCHQ of course, as Glenn Greenwald wrote about, had been targeting us as well, using some methods that were just as information-based, others that were outright illegal, including phone hacks of the sort that I used to get back then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They had plenty of reason to want to spy on us. Aaron Barr unfortunately did not do a very good job of it, and went and spoke to the Financial Times and presented some information that he said was correct, some of which was publicly known to be false, stuff about Anonymous having been founded by someone, there being a directorship of it, that kind of thing. And, of course, he ended up having to resign after these other things came out as a consequence of all that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When did you first encounter federal agents as you were doing this work? When did the government first start to kind of identify you as someone that they wanted to go after?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> It appears, based on mentions of me by Aaron Barr and some of the emails we took, and, as well as the grand jury and secret search warrants that we later had access to after I was imprisoned, that this began shortly after my role in bringing attention to and pursuing a criminal conspiracy by the DOJ and these companies against journalists and against activists. So this would have been about March is when the search warrants began I believe. And then, between March of that year and March of next year when I was finally raided for the first time, there was a lot of other things that we now realize were probably, emanated from the FBI or some other allied companies, as well as GCHQ, but the formal search warrants began again shortly after this was all unveiled and continued, and, you know, it went on until I was arrested.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chatroom Audio of Barrett Brown’s Arrest:\u003c/strong> [Yelling and screaming] Whoa, is Barrett getting fucking raided by the FBI! Holy shit!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> And, I mean, at one point, I think when you take the various indictments that you, faced correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, you were facing a combined total of up to more than 100 years in jail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> Yeah, that was how much exposure I had. You know, but they overcharge people it’s what they do. And they do so because that&#8217;s how that&#8217;s how they get their 95 percent convictions rate: juries tend to believe FBI agents, and FBI agents, as we saw in my case, and this was the great thing about my case, was that this was quite unusually, actually, got a lot of attention. And this was something where pretty conservative outlets, like The New York Times and outlets that are not generally willing to cry, you know, “this is absolute government persecution in our Republic,” all sort of agreed, you know, with the gag order I was placed under from the prosecutor&#8217;s own words, for having written an article that was &#8220;critical of the government,&#8221; things of that nature. It just became so obvious by the end that this was retaliation for my work exposing their doings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, it actually served, I think, to help as a prelude to the institutional disenchantment that we&#8217;ve seen lately with Trump Administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Among the things that they charged you with was sharing like a hyperlink to the hacked materials from Stratfor, this sort of pseudo-intelligence firm that charges people a lot of money to get their experts telling them what&#8217;s going on in various places around the U.S. and the world. Was that part of it that it was that you had linked to a file where people could download a zip of data from the Strafor hack?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> Yes, what happened was after the Stratfor hack had occurred, there&#8217;s anonymous chat rooms and there is Project PM chat room where me and some other researchers and journalists analyze, whenever Anonymous takes emails from a company or governments, we analyze them. And so the hackers had been pasting stuff, posting links into that anonymous chat room, and I was copying and pasting immediately into the Project TM chat room for my people as it happened. And one of them that I pasted ended up being a link to the credit card information for its subscribers and, as shown in those chats which are all part of the discovery, I asked after having pasted that link, &#8220;What was in this?&#8221; And the guy goes, &#8220;Oh, those are credit card numbers for whatever.&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, OK.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And as the forensics people for the government themselves found, I didn&#8217;t open the file. There&#8217;s no reason to believe that the 300 hundred people in the Anonymous chat room were, you know, not responsible for all the credit card charges made after that, whereas the twenty journalists and researchers at the Project PM chat room were, but I was to be hit with every credit card charge that have been done beginning the second that I&#8217;d posted that link in, even though those charges were dropped, the linking charges, because they were really wrong, there&#8217;s something called relevant conduct.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The FBI, working with the probation department, was able to get me on the hook for it $800,000 to Stratfor, having still held me liable for the entirety of that which was, you know, another extraordinary part of this and one of those things that are elements that are fairly common in justice system and that we see sort of amplified when they go after whistleblowers and activists and that sort of thing, and which people finally got to see and understand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Those things do help to bring attention to what these organizations actually are. They&#8217;re not just one thing, of course, but they are themselves very complicated institutions like all institutions that sometimes pursue the things they are supposed to pursue and sometimes don&#8217;t.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that&#8217;s, again, that&#8217;s a very different picture than the one painted for us by not just the congressmen who are sucking up to the FBI when they need to, but, you know, the average journalist, the average TV presenter, they don&#8217;t know these things. Why would they?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Is that the entirety of the case basically that they that they went after you on?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> After they had raided me, they told my lawyer they were going to charge my mother as well for obstruction of justice because when, they, you know they raided my apartment so I wasn&#8217;t there I got my mom&#8217;s place previous evening, my laptop was over there, she hid them in the kitchen cabinet. They came the first time that morning but didn&#8217;t have a warrant, and they asked me if I&#8217;d give my laptops, and I said, &#8220;No, there&#8217;s information on there involving Bahrainian and Tunisian activists who are living in nations that the U.S. are allies with, they&#8217;re military regimes and I&#8217;m not going to give you this information.&#8221; We know what the FBI does.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They came back with a warrant, five, six hours later. In meantime, you know, she had the laptops because we thought they were going to take them. They had no warrant when she hid them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So it wasn&#8217;t then that I started making the threats to one of the FBI who was involved, it was later on when we discovered HBGary, who they continued to work with had endangered me in various ways. They had ex-military people posting pictures of my residence and my address during a time when Anonymous was in this big feud with the Zetas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, just all of this and the use of confidential informants, confidential informants who were also working for HB Gary, and, in their words, were trying to get something to get me picked up on. All of that, with addition to the threats against my mom, kind of drove me to try to make a point that we couldn&#8217;t quite get across, which was I was going to do to this FBI agent what Aaron Barr had tried to do to activists, because clearly it was legal when Aaron Barr did it, so we would see if it was legal when I did it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB (YouTube)\u003c/strong> Ah, anyway, that&#8217;s why Robert Smith&#8217;s life is over. When I say his life is over, I&#8217;m not saying I’m gonna go kill him. But I am going to ruin his life and look into his fucking kids, because, Aaron Barr did the same thing. And he needs to be ready for it. How you like them apples?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You were never charged for any crimes related to HBGary, is that correct?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB: \u003c/strong>No. I was not convicted on anything involving the investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>And what did you ultimately plead to?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> Led to accessory after the fact, for having called Stratfor, called one of their executives. Right after the hack, Jeremy Hammond and Sabu, Hector Monsegur, who later turned out to be an FBI, who&#8217;d been turned by the FBI some months prior, we were talking about releasing all of the emails online at once, and I was concerned that this might reveal the identities of the people living abroad under the dictatorships who might be informants, who might be hurt by this. So, I told them, &#8220;Wait, let me see if, Stratfor wants to help us identify, help us redact them, these things, before we do that.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I contacted them, and then meanwhile the decision was made, which a couple of us had been advocating for them to just give the emails to WikiLeaks instead, so they could oversee that and that&#8217;s what was done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So for that phone call, and this was funny, because we had to actually to give them this idea, like after they dropped all the other charges and I will still facing a few others, once the fraud charges were dropped, which I wouldn&#8217;t have pled to, then we had the conversation about what I would plead to, and we had to give them something and that was what we came up with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, so, you know, the idea was that I helped them get away by making this call for them. Of course, obviously if the hackers have wanted to call Stratfor they could have done so without identifying themselves, that&#8217;s what they do, and of course that hackers were not originally planning to make that phone call, so it didn&#8217;t make any sense in that respect. But that&#8217;s true for a lot of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then there was: interference for the search warrant for hiding a laptop, or for my mom hiding the laptops or whatever, and then the threats against the FBI agent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I mean at the end of the day, then, what do you believe was at the heart of why they were going after you?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> It was clearly because we had done a pretty effective job of finding new pieces of the state, corporate intelligence apparatus, including a big report I put out on Romas/COIN, you know, involved Apple and Google at some point, dealing with the same Aaron Barr guy, to create this product for the Pentagon or the CIA or some government client.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, we had been very troublesome — the HBGary and Team Themis scandal was a huge black eye for the DOJ.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So we were doing a great deal stuff both in front of the press and with the press, and also behind the scenes for the press, to ensure that more of these things came out, that more were pursued and that the people involved were eventually have to deal with some actual consequences. And that was essentially why they went after me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>These are really outrageous prison sentences if you look at the nature of what they were even doing. I mean, it seems clear, particularly during that era that it was an attempt to just scare away people that had any thought of engaging in the hacking of any powerful institutions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s exactly what they wrote down they wanted to do, they wanted to deter Glenn Greenwald from — they wanted to force him to &#8220;choose career over cause&#8221; by virtue of their campaign against him, they wanted to scare donors away by investigating them, that kind of thing. So that was kind of that policy finally written down for all to see. Thankfully Anonymous was able to acquire and show everyone. And that&#8217;s been the pattern we&#8217;ve seen since.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, it&#8217;s all the more indefensible given that not only are they going after people for protest tax including all the Anons, they raided forty different households on a single day in late January 2011 for having supposedly been involved in the DDoS-ing of Mastercard and Visa and Amazon&#8217;s websites in protest of their economic blockade against WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This took down, you know, the Mastercard website for like three seconds, and forty armed raids. Meanwhile you have people working with the FBI, caught committing crimes and planning crimes against, you know, activists and against us: never charged, never investigated. So we have a situation in which we have a lawless organism growing out of the state, out of its companies, do business with the state that do not have to obey the law. And those of us who will be investigated regardless if we break the law or not.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that&#8217;s the kind of environment that does encourage people to go ahead and break the law, both because it&#8217;s practical and both, and also because it actually becomes your duty at some point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>How do you sort of keep your head up given that the state still has a boot still pretty firmly on part of your neck, and the fact that you lost years of your life to prison and to having to fight this battle instead of doing other things? How do you keep your head above water these days?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB: \u003c/strong>Well there was a time in which people were expected to, you know, put themselves at risk in exchange for causes. We live in a particularly weak, kind of post-war decadent society in which that kind of thing is now unusual. But there was a time in which people like Emma Goldman went to jail over and over again for sending birth control information to women over the U.S. mails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Emma Goldman:\u003c/strong> I decided to devote myself to the presentation of anarchism as social philosophy which aims at the emancipation — economic, social, political and spiritual — of the human race.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>BB: \u003c/strong>How did she do it? Well she looked to people before her who had taken similar things. There&#8217;s no argument I can ever makes anybody say that you have to be an activist and you have to engage in some civic duty that may be harmful to you. All I can say is that you have the choice to either just inherit and accept that the liberties that we still have, and just use them and enjoy them, or you can take the same route that those before you did, to give us those liberties, and that&#8217;s your choice. And that depends on what kind of person you want to be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond that, obviously everything they do to me, were in a position to turn it into propaganda and to damage them further. Obviously these institutions don&#8217;t really exist outside of our heads, and so should the extent that their authority, their moral authority, as perceived by the citizenry, is diminished, we come closer to the point at which we can challenge those institutions on entirely different scale altogether.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Alright, Barrett Brown, we&#8217;re going to leave it there.

She has been a street performer, a performance artist, a member of the band Dresden Dolls. Amanda Palmer is well known for crowdsourcing her art and her music. She has a book that&#8217;s called, &#8220;The Art of Asking.&#8221; She&#8217;s also given a TED Talk on that same subject. Amanda&#8217;s latest video and new song released just last month is a beautiful and epic short film called, &#8220;Mother.&#8221; It&#8217;s a cover of the Pink Floyd song. And she joins us now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Amanda Fucking Palmer, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Amanda Palmer:\u003c/strong> Oh, it&#8217;s a pleasure to be here. Thank you. Thank you for not censoring my name. I appreciate it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>So let&#8217;s start with one of your latest projects, performances, &#8220;Mother.&#8221; And the video that you produced for this has not been received in the same way as a lot of your other work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For people that haven&#8217;t seen it or haven&#8217;t heard the song, maybe you can start by describing what it&#8217;s all about.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP:\u003c/strong> This video is unlike any I have ever made because usually I make music videos because I&#8217;ve written songs, and this was different. I was watching the news and just horrified at all of the people chanting &#8220;Build a wall, build a wall.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Crowd: \u003c/strong>(chanting) Build that wall! Build that wall!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT: \u003c/strong>Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP:\u003c/strong> And I saw so many resonances between what was going on politically, and the Pink Floyd movie, &#8220;The Wall,&#8221; which I loved and worshipped growing up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;The Wall&#8221; by Pink Floyd]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>And then I thought, you know, the song &#8220;Mother&#8221; from &#8220;The Wall.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Mother&#8221; by Pink Floyd]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>It&#8217;s a powerful song to begin with and I thought: &#8220;Wow, this would be a really great anti-Trump song if you spun it the right way and created a video that combined the ideas of Donald Trump wanting to build this wall, and the idea that maybe he is who he is because he wasn&#8217;t loved enough.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Mother&#8221; by Amanda Palmer]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>But I mean then it was even stranger because the video came out and it came out in this whirlwind of feminism gone extreme nowadays.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, I won&#8217;t spoil the entire video for you but basically (laughs) it&#8217;s a bunch of mothers versus a bunch of politicians and a bunch of children being forced to build a wall by Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the mothers triumph at the end of the day and breastfeed Donald Trump (laughs).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> (laughs) I mean, what was behind the decision to actually show yourself literally breastfeeding someone dressed as Donald Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP:\u003c/strong> I knew that I wanted to cast people who were really going to believe in the message of the video, you know? I didn&#8217;t, I didn&#8217;t go to central casting for this: I went to my friends, which is what I do for most of my work. I thought I want as many — definitely as many women as possible, and most of the cast and crew were women, but I especially wanted women with children and mothers who would actually bring their kids to the set and get their children involved because the very message of the video is that we&#8217;re not going to play by these patriarchal rules. We&#8217;re going to write a different narrative.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, a lot of this merges with my own personal battle and insecurity that I had around having a child, because I was really scared. I was scared as an independent artist who always has control over my schedule and has really busted out my own path in a music industry full of men. I was afraid to have a kid. I was very afraid about what it would do to me, and how my kid would dance and interplay with this world of making music and being in recording studios and being on video shoots and doing what it is that I do as work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And the way that I&#8217;ve found around it, which is the way I&#8217;ve found around everything, is there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of separation between my life and my art. It&#8217;s all one big, blurry mess.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And there we all were making this video together, sending this huge message, not just to the White House, you know, saying that you&#8217;re not going to be able to educate our children into hatred and bigotry and isolation, because we&#8217;re the mothers and we&#8217;re in control, but also like, man, as an artist, I get to create my own narrative. I am not going to let a male-dominated entertainment industry and music industry tell me what to make, how to make it and who to make it with.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Mother&#8221; by Amanda Palmer]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When we started this program, we have had a commitment from the beginning to feature the work of independent artists and when we kicked that off, we stated very clearly that part of the reason we were doing that is because in times of fascism or the rise of authoritarianism, one of the first institutions to come under attack, they are cultural institutions: it&#8217;s the artists, it&#8217;s the writers, it&#8217;s the musicians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What do you think about that context of the artist as almost like freedom fighter in times like this, but also as a potential target of, to Donald Trump, you know, &#8220;the bad guys?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>I think you only need to look at the patterns in fascism through history and what they thought about artists and musicians and what they did (laughs) to know how critically important it is to maintain and celebrate and support free speech, and free speech within the artistic community, because all of these things are so fundamentally connected. And if fascist, controlling, fear-based governments didn&#8217;t think that artists and writers and journalists were dangerous, they wouldn&#8217;t take such great pains to silence them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We think about, &#8220;Oh, the Nazis burned books, that was so horrifying!&#8221; Well, the same core motivation of book burning exists with the ideas that are being promoted to strip away fair access to the internet and it&#8217;s going to directly target, well, people like you!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>You know, I almost feel like I&#8217;m living in a Sci-Fi novel sometimes when I think about the idea of net neutrality. Creating a world in which ten years from now, we&#8217;re telling our kids, &#8220;Yeah, the internet used to be amazing! You could just get on it and do anything.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You know, and net neutrality is like basics, it&#8217;s ground zero. Because if we&#8217;re not able to communicate to each other freely through the internet and through this, you know, free exchange of media and ideas and connections, especially, right now, as the developing world is finally you know hopping online in record numbers. You know, we forget that a lot of the people in the world don&#8217;t have internet, but they&#8217;re getting it right now, as we speak.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that could be the greatest gift and boon to humanity as people have, you know, all of a sudden access to the internet, access to education, access to information about how to grow better food, access to ideas that are going to get them out of stifling political situations, etc., etc.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Well, you know, the flip side of this discussion is that it probably would be a good idea to severely limit Donald Trump&#8217;s internet access. I mean it may well get us into a nuclear war. But also, I mean there are, there are there are real concerns. I mean our medical records are now digitized. Spy agencies no longer have to like break into Daniel Ellsberg&#8217;s psychiatrist&#8217;s office, they can hack us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean it&#8217;s a really strange world we&#8217;ve built for ourselves, but, at the end of the day, I, like you, I err on the side of more access to each other around the world is always going to result in a better world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>Yeah. I agree. And, you know, I&#8217;m incredibly excited about things like blockchain and what blockchain is going to be able to do for musicians, do for artists and you know bring back a kind of a fairness and equality in making sure that people who are working hard and making artists can still make a living and make a salary and get fairly compensated for their work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We&#8217;re rewriting a whole new code of ethics right now for the internet and how it works. And, you know, this is it, we&#8217;re the vanguard, we&#8217;re the firsts. You know? I grew up without the internet. I didn&#8217;t get online until I was about 17. And now everyone, you know, our kids, your two year-old, my two year-old, they&#8217;re all going to grow up digital natives and the code of ethics that we&#8217;re currently sitting down to write is going to shape their world how they&#8217;re treated, how they treat each other, what they believe they should and shouldn&#8217;t protect and share.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And you can look at that is really, really frightening or you can look at that, as, you know, really exciting or probably both. And, I was going to play you &#8220;Drowning in The Sound.&#8221; This song was written in a flash songwriting session. I went to my patrons and I said, &#8220;Listen, I&#8217;m going into the studio in a couple of days. I&#8217;m going to write a song really fast. I&#8217;m going to record it in a few days, and then I&#8217;m going to put it out to you guys and charge you for it. But before I go in, I want to sort of take the temperature of your emotional states, so everyone leave me a comment about how you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; And then I had to cope with the fact that 900 people sent me comments and some of them were five paragraphs long and I actually spent, you know, seven hours sitting there reading off these comments on the internet, while simultaneously Hurricane Harvey was hitting Texas and I was refreshing the New York Times and The Guardian and, you know, looking at, looking at pictures of senior citizens trapped in rooms with four feet of water and families stuck on roofs of homes and people unable to connect with and help each other.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And simultaneously, you know, people made a cute joke on Facebook about Taylor Swift&#8217;s new video which had just come out that week, her video for &#8220;Look What You Made Me Do,&#8221; and I, you know, I didn&#8217;t even say anything negative about her. I basically said, &#8220;Oh look, she&#8217;s going through a goth period, finally!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s angry Taylor, you know, because she was so busy as a teenager being a bubble gum country pop star that she didn&#8217;t get to lock herself in the room and smoke clove cigarettes and listen to The Cure like we did it. And, now she&#8217;s finally going through her angsty goth phase, congratulations Taylor!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And given that the internet is the internet, I came back to that post an hour later and it had blown up on Facebook and the top comments were about how Amanda Palmer was an unapologetic racist because she supported Taylor Swift. (laughs) And it was just one of those whiplash moments where I was like, &#8220;Really? This is what it&#8217;s come to? You know, this is what it&#8217;s come to that I walk away from the internet for an hour and a bunch of people decide that because I&#8217;ve made a joke about Taylor Swift being goth, I&#8217;m an unapologetic racist?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>That’s why I love Twitter! The nuance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>Oh my god. But, there I was, reading that comment on Facebook an hour before I went into the recording studio to sit down and pen this song and the eclipse it just happened, I had been to the eclipse the week before and I had made a last-minute decision to grab my one year-old and take him down to Tennessee where I knew that I had a place to stay because I didn&#8217;t want to miss this moment in history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, all of those things: the eclipse, the Facebook thing, Hurricane Harvey, the general political climate, all of the disconnection, the metaphors abounded. Those are all the ingredients that that went into the song.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;Drowning in The Sound&#8221; by Amanda Palmer]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS: \u003c/strong>Amanda Fucking Palmer, thank you for being with us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>AP: \u003c/strong>You are so welcome.

He has just published his story in a new book, “The Doomsday Machine.” Jeremy takes on the false news report about the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks that was aggressively promoted by CNN, MSNBC, and CBS. Steve Bannon is no longer in the National Security Council, but he remains one of the most powerful political propagandists in the country. A new short film from Field of Vision takes us inside the very strange world of Steve Bannon’s films and how a focus group responded to being bombarded with scenes from Bannon’s movies. We talk to the co-director of “American Carnage,” Farihah Zaman. Patterson Hood of the band Drive-By Truckers talks about growing up in Alabama and how the civil rights struggle and George Wallace impacted his life. Donald Trump calls in to Delilah for life advice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Watch “American Carnage” by Farihah Zaman and Jeff Reichert:\u003c/em>\u003cbr />\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"jw-video\" data-video-key=\"VxaKOqw9\" data-aspect-ratio=\"16%3A9\" data-height=\"\" data-width=\"\" data-size=\"standard\" data-autostart=\"\">\u003c/div>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Delilah Rene:\u003c/strong> Hi, you&#8217;ve found Delilah on this cold, winter night, only on Lake 98.1 Hi thank you for calling the Delilah show.

To our knowledge, Donald Trump has never called into the Delilah show for life advice, or for some warm understanding and compassion at a time of deep loneliness. This has been a work of fiction and not an actual Delilah segment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This is Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Jeremy Scahill on the False News Report Involving the Trump Campaign and WikiLeaks That Was Promoted by CNN, MSNBC, and CBS\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 39 of Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> This is a sick system from the inside and, you know, there&#8217;s no country like our country but we have a lot of sickness in some of our institutions and we&#8217;re working very hard. We&#8217;ve got a lot of them straightened out. But we do have, we really do, we have a rigged system in this country and we have to change it. Terrible! Terrible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We are closing in on the end of Donald Trump&#8217;s first year in office and it&#8217;s been a surreal and, at times, terrifying roller coaster ride. The aggressiveness in the reporting on this White House is unparalleled in modern history. But almost all of it focuses on questions of whether, or not, Trump and his family members and officials of his campaign and administration colluded or criminally conspired in any way with Russia or Russian agents to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This coverage is the story, and almost every other event in the U.S. or around the world is treated almost like a burden or an afterthought that must occasionally take up some of the valuable Trump-Russia air time. This story, Trump-Russia, has the prospect of bringing down a president, so obviously it has to be covered and it should be reported on aggressively.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But there&#8217;s a disturbing pattern that&#8217;s been playing out where news organizations are so desperate to be the first that they&#8217;ve increasingly gotten important facts wrong. It also appears that, in some cases, news organizations are so willing to believe almost anything about Donald Trump that responsible journalistic practices and the verifying of information that you&#8217;ve been given, including from anonymous sources, has just been cast aside.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Take the case of last week&#8217;s explosive report on CNN that an e-mail had surfaced that purported to show that the Trump campaign, in fact, specifically Donald Trump, Jr., had received advance knowledge of a WikiLeaks dump of DNC e-mails. That e-mail, which was supposedly sent to Donald Trump, Jr., contained what CNN described as a secret decryption key. The ramifications were explosive and obvious: Donald Trump must have been in on the whole thing. They had knowledge of what was going to be published by WikiLeaks before it even came out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Manu Raju:\u003c/strong> This e-mail on September 4, 2016, was sent to Donald Trump, then-candidate Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and others in the Trump organization, including Donald Trump, Junior&#8217;s personal secretary. And in this — personal assistant, I should say — and in this e-mail it actually has a decryption code and a link to a web address where purportedly they could have received the hacked WikiLeaks documents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> NBC News correspondent Ken Dilanian then followed up on CNN&#8217;S report and he said that his sources had confirmed that this e-mail was real, that the date on it was correct and that it was sent before WikiLeaks dumped the e-mails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ken Dilanian:\u003c/strong> Two sources with direct knowledge of this are telling us that Congressional investigators have obtained an e-mail from a man named Mike Erickson, obviously they don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s his real name, offering Donald Trump and his son Donald Trump, Jr. access to WikiLeaks documents. This was about September 2016, right in the middle of the campaign, when WikiLeaks was putting out some documents, hadn&#8217;t put out other documents. Remember the Russians had hacked the Democrats and handed this stuff over to WikiLeaks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> By the way, Ken Dilanian, that NBC reporter, yeah, he&#8217;s famous for having sent the CIA his stories for review before they&#8217;ve been published: That&#8217;s a serious journalistic crime. So, I can&#8217;t say I was shocked when I saw Ken Dilanian promoting the story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Oh, and CBS? They also ran with this story. And they said they too had gotten it confirmed. These networks that had legal analysts on, to weigh what these stunning revelations might mean for Donald Trump and the investigations into Trump and Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kate Bolduan: \u003c/strong>From a legal sense, what do you think this means?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Paul Callan:\u003c/strong> It&#8217;s a very interesting development because if this was an attempt to give stolen emails, hacked emails to the Trump campaign and the Trump campaign acted on it, you would have an argument that they were then in possession of stolen property, property they knew to be stolen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KB: \u003c/strong>Right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PC:\u003c/strong> Now that can be a crime under federal law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> The problem with all of this? The story was totally false. CNN, CBS, and NBC all wrongly reported that the email in question was dated September 4, 2016. These networks said that their sources had confirmed that. But then the Washington Post reported that the date was actually ten days later — it was September 14, 2016 and they actually published the email.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That enormous error that was promoted by CBS, CNN and NBC meant that the entire story that they were telling on their airwaves, nonstop, was pointless, insignificant, and revealed literally nothing at all about Trump, WikiLeaks, Russia, or collusion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What it revealed in this non-story was that a random person somewhere on the interwebs sent Don Jr. an email that pointed to a batch of files that WikiLeaks had released along with the description protocols that WikiLeaks had shared with literally the entire world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>None of these networks will name the sources who fed them this false information and no reporters have been disciplined for pushing this false and inflammatory story. Once these things go viral it&#8217;s impossible to put the genie back in the bottle.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prominent liberal commentators breathlessly spread the false CNN story. Some of them had images of cannons — boom! Or atomic bombs. Democrats in Congress promoted it, getting thousands and thousands of retweets. And then came the quiet walking back of the story. The deleting of tweets, the sweeping it under the rug — oh, and the justifications.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that famed Soviet tactic straight from Vladimir Putin&#8217;s playbook, Whataboutism. &#8220;Well, yes, I mean we got this wrong but we issued a correction. But what about Trump&#8217;s lies?&#8221; Sorry, guys: you live by the sword, you die by the sword, you are engaged in Whataboutism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On Sunday, CNN&#8217;s media criticism program, Reliable Sources, sought to downplay this event by having on two people to defend CNN. One is CNN contributor Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame, and the other is David Frum of neocon fame. He&#8217;s the guy who helped Bush and Cheney sell their wars on the world and is now a celebrated member of the anti-Trump #resistance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>David Frum:\u003c/strong> The worst mistakes that press organizations have made: CNN made, Raju and his co-author, the mistake they made, it was important, they promptly corrected it. The worst mistakes CNN have made have been result of the determination to bring in-house, Trump, Trump associates in order to promote Trump falsehoods, not from Trump HQ, or not from the White House, but with CNN&#8217;s own brand on them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This segment on CNN was a naked, and I would say pathetic, attempt to sweep all of this under the rug. And because news organizations seem willing to believe almost anything about Trump and his cabal, any mistake is just a small matter compared to how awful Trump truly is — and we know how awful Trump is — I think this is a really serious mistake.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Also, I should mention, Brian Ross at ABC News, before these stories came out on CNN, CBS, NBC, he was suspended over a false report that he did which is of a similar vein just a few days before this story came out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Brian Ross\u003c/strong>: He has promised the full cooperation to the Mueller team. He&#8217;s prepared to testify we have told by a confidante, against President Trump, against members of the Trump family and others in the White House. He is prepared to testify that president Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump ordered him directly, directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As well we&#8217;re told that Flynn made the decision to cooperate only in the last twenty-four hours — that he was distraught about the decision but feels he&#8217;s doing the right thing for his country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> That Brian Ross report turned out to be false. But it seems that what had mattered to Brian Ross at that moment was being first. And it&#8217;s about Trump, so it&#8217;s okay if we loosen editorial standards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, Donald Trump is undoubtedly on a rampage against journalists and journalism. It&#8217;s dangerous. He&#8217;s labeling the press enemies. He&#8217;s calling for journalists to be fired, for news networks to lose their licenses — all of this is extremely disturbing. But so too is the willingness of so many journalists today to believe anything just because it is Donald Trump. And CNN, CBS and NBC, they gave Trump an incredible real-life example of fake news, that he&#8217;s going to use over, and over, and over.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Donald Trump was gleeful as he spoke in Florida last Friday the night that all of this stuff broke.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> They took this fraudster from ABC — they suspended him for a month, they should have fired him for what he wrote. (Crowd cheers.) He drove the stock market down 350 points in minutes, which, by the way, tells you they&#8217;re really like me, right? When you think of it. And you know what he cost people, and I said to everybody, &#8220;Get yourself a lawyer and sue ABC News. Sue &#8217;em!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Here&#8217;s the challenge that all of us now live with under Donald Trump. The President of the United States constantly lies about big things and small things. We know that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Fox News lies about big things and small things. We know that, too. But other major news organizations seem so willing to believe almost anything if it&#8217;s about Trump that it&#8217;s as though common sense and attachment to reality has been cast aside. I honestly wonder which is worse: the known liars at Fox News intentionally spreading propaganda or those who claim to be about the facts but keep getting big stories wrong because it&#8217;s about Trump!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All journalists and news organizations make mistakes. The Intercept has definitely made mistakes. But we&#8217;re all at a crossroads here. If CNN, CBS and NBC don&#8217;t name publicly the sources who fed them this false information, that&#8217;s flat out-wrong. If there are people in the U.S. government or on Capitol Hill — perhaps, oh, I don&#8217;t know — Democrats on the intelligence committees or working for the intelligence committees investigating Trump and Russia. If there are these people in government who are knowingly spreading false information, that is of vital interest to the American public. And if CNN, CBS and NBC News do not name the source or sources of this false information then their credibility has really been shot. And that is ultimately a victory for Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This whole situation also reminds me of the way that the CIA and the FBI are now discussed in liberal circles and on cable TV in this country: that somehow these institutions are protecting us from the evil monster Donald Trump. It&#8217;s as though history and context don&#8217;t matter at all. All of the horrid policies of the FBI and the CIA, they&#8217;re just tossed out the window. The awful records of James Comey and Robert Mueller, those are irrelevant because now they&#8217;re the knights of truth and the knights of justice and they&#8217;re giving hope to the resistance everywhere. Why? Because all that matters is how awful Trump is and how we can get rid of him ASAP. This willful dishonesty is sickening and it&#8217;s going to come back to haunt this country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Remember during the campaign when all those CIA and military people and foreign policy luminaries came out to endorse and support Hillary Clinton, and how they portrayed Trump as reckless and dangerous? It was quite shocking to have senior CIA people, including the then-current director of the CIA, John Brennan, openly attacking a candidate for the presidency. The former acting CIA director Mike Morell, he was one of Hillary Clinton&#8217;s most prominent advocates. He hadn&#8217;t even run out of his official CIA business cards yet when he was writing op-eds advocating for Clinton and attacking Trump — and then Trump won.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, if you want to understand the context of why Trump may be suspicious of the intelligence community, it&#8217;s worth looking at how he was treated when they all thought that Hillary was a shoo-in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mike Morell, in an interview recently with political magazine, recently acknowledged that he may have played a role in tarnishing Trump&#8217;s relationship with the intelligence community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mike Morell:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s put ourselves here in Donald Trump&#8217;s shoes. So, what does he see, right? He sees a former director of CIA and a former director of NSA, Mike Hayden, criticizing him and his policies, right? And could rightfully have said, &#8220;Huh,&#8221; you know? &#8220;What&#8217;s going on with these intelligence guys?&#8221; And then he sees a former acting director and deputy director of the CIA criticizing him and endorsing his opponent. And then he gets his first intelligence briefing after becoming the Republican nominee and within 24 to 48 hours there are leaks out of that that are critical of him and his then-national security adviser Mike Flynn.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And so, this stuff starts to build, right? And he must have said to himself, &#8220;What is it with these intelligence guys? Are they political?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> This acknowledgement from the former acting CIA director is part of the same too late, not enough response that CNN, CBS and NBC had to these false reports that they promoted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the end of the day, they&#8217;ve all given Trump actual evidence to support his otherwise truly outrageous claims. This Trump derangement syndrome is going to have long-lasting impacts on journalism and public trust. This is all going to set a very dangerous precedent that could be used in the future to suppress or subvert a progressive political force or politician that challenges the national security state or the corporate domination of our lives and the corporate domination of our electoral process.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This short-sightedness poses a very serious threat to our democratic processes and it should be called out for what it is: a key part of the serious problems plaguing our country right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Okay, let&#8217;s get on with the show.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Musical interlude]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean on the Mueller Investigation and Trump Presidency\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> We begin today with a man who knows exactly what it&#8217;s like to be sitting inside the White House as government investigators have legions of microscopes deployed to examine every aspect of the president, his administration and his political operatives. I&#8217;m talking about John Dean, the former White House counsel to Richard Nixon. Dean was convicted at the time of obstruction of justice and then he testified in front of the U.S. Congress on a variety of crimes that had been committed by the Nixon White House during the course of the Watergate investigations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dean, who wrote a book on the Bush-Cheney administration, called &#8220;Worse Than Watergate&#8221; has emerged as a fierce critic of Donald Trump and he joins me now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>John Dean, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>John Dean:\u003c/strong> My pleasure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s your assessment of where we are right now?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Well, I think if you look at the historical record and mine, which I&#8217;m most familiar of course is Watergate. But I&#8217;d also say the same thing for Iran-Contra and the Lewinsky scandal, other presidential scandals. But let&#8217;s just focus on Watergate. If you look at the event that christened the name Watergate, it was the arrest of the campaign operatives in the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex that happened on June 17 of 1972.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster: \u003c/strong>Good evening. We have a mystery story out of Washington. Five people have been arrested and charged with breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the middle of the night.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> The Democrat National Committee is located in the Watergate office building. The burglars forced the stairwell door then taped its latch open. The door, now part of police evidence, was noticed by one of the guards employed by the Watergate complex. At first the police found nothing — then they spied five men crouching behind some desks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD\u003c/strong>: The end of the scandal, the hard end, if you will, was on January 1, 1975, with the conviction of H.R. Haldeman the, Nixon&#8217;s chief of staff, John Mitchell. his former attorney general, and John Ehrlichman, his top domestic advisor, who were convicted for conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury. That&#8217;s 928 days from start to finish and there are obviously events that precede and followed both. But Nixon is out for example several months before Haldeman and Ehrlichman are convicted. So, it — we&#8217;re very early in the big picture of things. The investigation is really just getting underway.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How has social media changed the way that these situations, crises or investigations at the highest levels of power in this country, how has social media changed these events?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Watergate was initially ignored, even though it was a pretty spectacular scandal with five men arrested in business suits and surgical gloves with hundred dollar bills in their pocket in the offices of the Democratic National Committee and direct links back to the Nixon reelection committee. That was a pretty spectacular opening but people tired of the story, within 48 hours, the New York Times virtually stopped covering it. Only the Washington Post really gave it attention and the only people who were following the story were in the Beltway.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s not till April of 1973 that the public starts really getting serious about following it and that&#8217;s when the rumors start that this may well bring down a president. Initially people give Nixon the benefit of the doubt. He is overwhelmingly reelected in &#8217;72, notwithstanding the fact that the shadow of Watergate was over him. What social media has done — it&#8217;s sort of accelerated the news cycle, but still it just takes X amount of time to undertake an investigation and X amount of time for the public to absorb events. So, while they&#8217;re faster, I don&#8217;t think that it is going to make that dramatically that much faster. It&#8217;s still going to take time for this all unfold.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What is this scandal about, in your view, I mean it is possible, correct, that we could go all the way down this road and Trump finishes his first term and he&#8217;s not directly, meaning himself, touched by the law, or impeached, or having impeachment proceedings begin against him — that is a possible outcome of this. What&#8217;s the scandal in your view that it should be investigated regarding Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Well the scandal is an odd creature, it&#8217;s a way that elites deal with sort of middle level offenses. For example, the Boston bombing of a marathon is not a scandal. The Holocaust is not a scandal. Those are just pretty brutal criminal events.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Scandal is a lower-level but may or may not involve criminal activity. So, what we&#8217;re looking at here, the scandal, is whether or not Trump colluded with the Russians to help defeat Hillary and to win the presidency. That&#8217;s really the question. And it may or may not rise to the level of a criminal conspiracy. Then again, it might. He might have obstructed justice to prevent the investigation by overreacting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nixon, for example, there is not a scintilla of evidence that Nixon ordered the Watergate break-in or actually knew it was going to happen, but he certainly did involve himself from the outset in the cover-up. He was knee-deep in that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You have a sort of small camp of Republicans, John McCain is certainly in that camp. Politicians or political figures in the Republican Party who are openly criticizing the president, although they&#8217;re not calling for his removal or his impeachment or anything like that. And then you have a huge chunk of Republican lawmakers that tend to avoid saying anything specific about the president, but celebrate when, you know, they get their tax plan past the house, et cetera. When did the House start to crumble for Nixon in terms of support of Republicans in Congress regarding the Watergate investigations?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> You’ve gotta remember the Congress during the Nixon era and the Democratic Party was much different than it is today, as was the Republican Party. There were actually big tent parties where you had — ran from conservative to liberal in both parties. What you had, though, was Republicans certainly did sit on their hands as long as they could until the odor got so bad. And what happened also is the cover-up metastasized from just really preventing the investigation of what had happened at the Watergate, to realizing the reason the Nixon White House was involved in covering up Watergate is that Hunt and Liddy, the organizers of the Watergate break-in had worked at the Nixon White House where they&#8217;d undertaken similar activities where they had organized a bungled break-in at Daniel Ellsberg&#8217;s psychiatrist’s office after Ellsberg leaked the so-called Pentagon Papers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Richard Nixon:\u003c/strong> And remember, within a year, people are not going to be thinking of this, they&#8217;re going to be thinking of what we&#8217;ve been doing, Henry. So —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Henry Kissinger:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;ll tell you what, Mr. President, no one will be able to —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Richard Nixon:\u003c/strong> Frankly, people are getting goddamn sick of it now, you know.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HK:\u003c/strong> I think that in fact —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RN:\u003c/strong> I know that people just, I just have a feeling that even, you pick up the paper and go Watergate, Watergate, Dean charges this, somebody charges that, who broke into this psychiatrist&#8217;s office? Wasn&#8217;t that the silliest goddamn thing?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Direct orders from the White House from John Ehrlichman who in writing approved it with the words, &#8220;So long as I have your assurance it&#8217;s not traceable to the White House.&#8221; Which later, they go to jail on his own assurance, because the same players were involved in both the Watergate break-in and the Ellsberg break-in is the reason the Nixon White House gets involved.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nixon isn&#8217;t even told about these activities until fairly late in the cover-up. He&#8217;s just sympathetic to his attorney general who he assumes has approved this crazy break-in at the Watergate and he doesn&#8217;t want him embarrassed. So, a very simple reason: we may find a parallel with Trump, where Trump has no direct relationship with the Russians other than some sort of general admiration for Putin or he may have some financial connections of some nature or hope to have some, who knows what his real motives are here, that hasn&#8217;t come out yet. But he could have lots of reasons for, for example firing Comey, because he insisted on ­­going forward with an investigation of General Flynn. It could be just very similar the situation between Nixon and Mitchell. We don&#8217;t know yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and there&#8217;s a lot of attention right now the president&#8217;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who seems to have played a role on the campaign and at least for some part of this administration as kind of being that the guy you need to talk to get Trump&#8217;s ear on a variety of issues. And it seems like Jared&#8217;s name keeps popping up in all of these sort of many investigations or the indictments, etc., that he was at this particular meeting, that he directed Flynn to have this call — I mean it really does, you get a sense that the hammer&#8217;s going to drop soon on Jared Kushner.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s an interesting question because I&#8217;ve been chatting with former prosecutors and they feel a special sensitivity about indicting family of a target. I&#8217;m not clear from my discussions if it&#8217;s because they expect the fight will be even tougher to prosecute, or if they think juries will sympathize with family that gets swept up and turn against the prosecution of such people. We&#8217;ve heard very little about General Flynn&#8217;s son who we know was swept up in some way with his father in some nefarious activities, but his father had clearly been given a pass. It appears he&#8217;s been given a pass because they were getting too close to his son — yet that&#8217;s stuff disappeared from the scene. We don&#8217;t know what the trade was there, where he got a one count false statement indictment plea in exchange for giving up clearly what could have been multiple counts of false statements, and a potential conspiracy count, although one would think if there was a conspiracy that they had their hands around, they would have done a one count conspiracy because that would have made him a stronger witness in a conspiracy case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> How significant of a witness will Flynn be based on what we currently understand about Mueller&#8217;s investigation?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Well if proximity is helpful, and it typically is very helpful and can be decisive, he could be a remarkable witness for Mueller. He&#8217;s cooperating, he has to be truthful, I assume that the agreement is the only thing he can be indicted for after taking the plea would be to give false testimony, so he should be a very powerful witness because he certainly has proximity. He goes back to the campaign, he knows the thinking of the candidate and the thinking they brought together to the White House, where Trump has you know virtually no foreign policy or national security experience at all, Flynn is a fairly sophisticated player from days past in national security matters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> One of the things that kind of astonished me is that some of the contents of Flynn&#8217;s plea agreement and also the statement of offense that accompanied it, I just want to read from because I&#8217;m kind of astonished that this didn&#8217;t get more attention: &#8220;On or about December 22, 2016, a very senior member of the presidential transition team directed Flynn to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution&#8221; — meaning this resolution that the Obama administration was going to abstain on at the United Nations Security Council, that was on Palestine. And, of course, Bibi Netanyahu and others who in the United States and Israel were very much opposed to the idea that Obama was going to abstain from a vote on this issue. But they say that General Flynn was directed by a very senior member of the presidential transition team not to lobby Russia on anything involving elections because this was after the election, but on behalf of the Israeli government. And I&#8217;m kind of astonished that more attention hasn&#8217;t been paid to that because it pretty clearly looks like it was collusion between the United States&#8217; incoming administration and Israel and that Russia was sort of a player that is on the Security Council that could help do the bidding of Israel rather than the bidding of Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> It is curious. A lot of things in that plea agreement have not been focused on. Whether he was bought on that issue or not, it&#8217;s hard to tell. Maybe, I think that that&#8217;s something that just came up accidentally, because it&#8217;s clearly outside the charter of the special council. He wasn&#8217;t looking for Israeli influences and this looks like something he just encountered as they were investigating, which then put it in the parameters of his undertaking.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right. It&#8217;s not about a policy that, you know, would benefit Russia, in fact, you know Russia historically would vote against Israel on these resolutions in front of the Security Council anyway. It&#8217;s that they tried to get Russia to delay the vote or to do whatever it could to ensure that the Obama administration did not abstain from voting. To me, the headline there is that they tried to get Russia to help them collude with Israel, rather than like, you know, Vladimir Putin&#8217;s secret agenda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Well, yeah, and it certainly appears that the Logan Act which has never been prosecuted by any prior administration against any incoming presidency is kind of central. The Logan Act, for those who don&#8217;t know it, of course, prohibits citizens from engaging in foreign affairs on behalf of the United States when they have no authority to do so. And that&#8217;s exactly what the Trump people were doing from day one after they found themselves as winners, they started undercutting the sitting president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Kristen Welker:\u003c/strong> Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? Prior to your inauguration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> No I didn&#8217;t. No I didn&#8217;t! No I didn&#8217;t. Mike —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>KW:\u003c/strong> And would you have fired him if information hadn&#8217;t leaked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> Excuse me. No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job — he was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn&#8217;t doing it. I didn&#8217;t direct him but I would have directed him because that&#8217;s his job.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think a lot of people, particularly those who are Republicans, even if they&#8217;re opposed to Trump, wonder how different would it be for the Trump people to, let&#8217;s say that they did accept e-mails that were Hillary Clinton&#8217;s private emails and they want to use that as part of their opposition research, in your view, is there something inherently illegal or, on the other hand, immoral about doing that and isn&#8217;t that something that sort of every political operative wants to get the information from wherever they can get it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> I suppose there&#8217;s the potential there are number of federal and state laws that prohibit hacking and if they are conspiring to hack or to disseminate illegally obtained information, that could have consequences. We don&#8217;t know if that happened. Watergate showed some of the parameters of what was tolerable opposition research. For example, spreading false stories about candidates without putting your signature resulted in a young lawyer by the name of Donald Segretti, getting prosecuted. That&#8217;s still the law where you have to identify yourself: if you put out information about an opponent, you better well identify the source of the of the material and who disseminated it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and, of course, I mean if somebody came to a campaign and said, &#8220;Hey, we hacked these emails of your opponent and here they are,&#8221; obviously now you&#8217;ve been made aware of a criminal offense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re either an accessory or a co-conspirator at that point.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and so if, on the other hand you&#8217;re told, &#8220;Oh, sources in Russia have all of this, you know, bad information on Hillary and they have, they have some of the emails and they&#8217;re willing to provide them to that campaign,&#8221; if you don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Well, were they illicitly obtained?&#8221; There&#8217;s no rule that says you have to ask them how it&#8217;s obtained. It would just be if you knew that they were illicitly or illegally obtained, you then have —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;ll tell you one thing, if, any lawyer, or any person who&#8217;s involved in a presidential campaign and is getting assistance from a foreign country, if they don&#8217;t go to the FBI, they&#8217;re demented.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Oh, I agree with you, 100 percent, but also if you look at also the Fusion GPS report, I mean they had all sorts of stuff sourced to Russians about Trump and that&#8217;s where I think some of the, I don&#8217;t mean to be sounding like I&#8217;m Trump&#8217;s defender, here.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> That doesn&#8217;t mean it was the government, though. Foreign individuals can certainly voice opinions and opposition research can pick that up. If somebody on the streets of London oversaw Trump doing something, there would be no prohibition against getting that in your opposition research. If the British government and MI-6 sent the information over, that&#8217;s a different story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, and I think, in that case, it was unclear who they were. It was well-informed Russians, intelligence sources within Russia, which could be former spooks or what have you, I think what you&#8217;re saying here that I think almost every American would agree with is any messing around with the existing policies of a country while you are not sanctioned to be speaking officially for the country, people that do that need to be held accountable. Is that essentially what you&#8217;re saying?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s right. And we well could see a conspiracy to violate the Logan Act here. That could be a very legitimate crime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I know you wrote an excellent book about the Bush-Cheney administration, &#8220;Worse Than Watergate&#8221; and I&#8217;ve see that you&#8217;ve joked before that you should have saved that title for this administration. How bad of a president is Trump?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I mean, let&#8217;s set aside the kind of, you know, buffoonish behavior and the tweeting, etc., except insofar as it&#8217;s relevant to the potential for a nuclear war or war with North Korea or what have you. I mean, Bush and Cheney, their wars killed hundreds of thousands of people across the world, they authorized torture, they ran this whole series of black sites. I mean, Trump has a lot of killing to do to catch up to those guys and I&#8217;m wondering: Does Trump fall into the category of like, the great monsters of history or even the worst presidents in the United States?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> The short term answer is, he&#8217;s the most incompetent person who&#8217;s ever filled that job. So, he comes totally ill equipped to be president. He has zero curiosity, he doesn&#8217;t read, he doesn&#8217;t have any knowledge of history other than what people tell him, he is very susceptible to misinformation. So, it&#8217;s his incompetence level going in is the most frightening thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The second most frightening thing is his personality, where he&#8217;s clearly an authoritarian personality. And once he does learn how it works, I think he can become a killing machine if he remains in office that long.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bush/Cheney, and I do put them together, I don&#8217;t think George Bush would have been a half-bad president had he not have picked the vice president he did, but he picked a vice president who really was a co-president, and Cheney is about as dark a character as has ever sat beside the Oval Office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Vice President Dick Cheney:\u003c/strong> Torture was what the al Qaeda terrorists did to 3,000 Americans on 9/11. There is no comparison between that and what we did with respect to enhanced interrogation. I&#8217;d do it again in a minute. It worked! It absolutely — it worked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> When the Iran-Contra investigations were happening on Capitol Hill, Cheney was a member of Congress representing Wyoming and he was one of the chief authors of the dissent of the congressional investigation that alleged not that Iran-Contra was, you know, a scandalous criminal enterprise that undermined American security as the majority report had indicated. But that it was a model that should be defended for how the executive should be protecting America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Exactly. Exactly. That&#8217;s, to me, how radical Cheney was. He was the one who was helping to kill a serious investigation, keeping it in a joint committee which are never particularly effective, and then writing this defense for a minority report that justified it, and helping to prevent an impeachment that otherwise probably would have occurred of Reagan had Cheney not been up there running interference for him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I sort of have been referring, jokingly, of course, to this current situation as kind of Iran-Contra for idiots. Because if you, if you look at the layers of protection that Reagan had, I mean obviously there also were some clowns involved with Iran-Contra, but the layers of protection that extended to various entities within the U.S. government, was much more intact and effective than anything Trump has in part because of what you&#8217;re pointing out, John Dean, which is Trump doesn&#8217;t understand how this system works. Nixon did understand how the system worked. Reagan&#8217;s people understood how the system worked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump, he truly is an outsider, and that&#8217;s a two-edged sword.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> It is. But he&#8217;s not stupid, and he is going to learn how it works. And that&#8217;s when I think he can be even more dangerous than he is because of his incompetence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He brought Kelly over to run the White House because it was obviously so chaotic, that the place was dysfunctional beyond belief. I&#8217;m told his campaign was also. But he has stumbled through as a highly dysfunctional businessman. And I think he thinks that he just needs a little functioning to operate as president. And I think, eventually, he&#8217;ll figure out how this thing works and God knows what he&#8217;ll do then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, on the one hand, Trump has levied a lot of criticism at the CIA. Right now, the big target is the FBI and the Justice Department. Of course, Fox News is pushing these talking points.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Jeanine Pirro:\u003c/strong> There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice. It needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired, but who need to be taken out in handcuffs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> They all despise Robert Mueller, even though some, less than a year ago, they thought he was a great pick. But when you have a president like Trump who doesn&#8217;t want full presidential daily briefings, there&#8217;s a part of me that wonders if the kind of career, shadow government that exists in this country, and what I mean by that is like the people that aren&#8217;t subjected to a Senate confirmation or elections, that work at the CIA or the military, they may feel this is kind of like a golden era for them because no one&#8217;s paying attention to what they&#8217;re doing. And the White House isn&#8217;t asking tough questions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> Oh, absolutely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Like, I&#8217;m afraid of what&#8217;s going to happen at the CIA and the military, because this guy doesn&#8217;t seem to care.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s also a possibility. People are opening drawers and pulling out plans that they thought they&#8217;d never be able to do anything with, and now they&#8217;ve got a chief executive in the White House that really doesn&#8217;t have a clue what&#8217;s going on in the executive branch, and they&#8217;re likely to do anything.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We&#8217;ve seen the lack of caliber of people that Trump has put in the top jobs, leaving so many vacancies in so many departments and agencies. That&#8217;s theoretically the management team that watches.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> John, do you see Donald Trump finishing a full term as president?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> At this point, unless the Congress in its totality, both the House and the Senate, in 2018, go Democratic, and we have a national experience that sort of parallels what happened in Virginia in their last election, I see him finishing his term. I don&#8217;t know if he can get reelected, but I certainly don&#8217;t see him being removed. If he does lose in 2018, and it&#8217;s a Virginia type of reaction nationally, I think he&#8217;s in a lot of trouble. And I think that&#8217;s where he should be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think if he doesn&#8217;t finish a term it&#8217;s because he has a massive heart attack from eating all that McDonald&#8217;s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> That is — he does not look like a man who&#8217;s in very good physical condition. And anybody who believes that exercise is something you have only so much in your system to handle, is not somebody who is fit to be president in many ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS\u003c/strong>: Right, I mean, good thing he burnt down Michelle Obama&#8217;s organic garden and replaced it with ketchup trees.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> (laughs) Yes!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> John Dean, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JD:\u003c/strong> My pleasure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> John Dean was White House counsel to Richard Nixon.

Now, under Nixon, the CIA began an unprecedented spying operation on more than 10,000 people inside the United States. They were anti-Vietnam war protesters, black activists, other dissidents — these operations flourished under Nixon. But some of them stretched all the way back to the 1950s,\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And this is relevant because when the CIA was first established in 1947, the law stated that the CIA could not conduct such domestic spy operations. When the crimes of Nixon and Watergate are discussed, it&#8217;s pretty common for the narrative to be the one about operatives working for Nixon&#8217;s reelection campaign breaking into the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. in 1972. The men who carried out that botched bugging operation were known as the Plumbers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But this criminal entity had already been in operation before that break-in. In fact, they were created to stop leaks, hence their name the Plumbers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 1971, the Plumbers broke into the office of a psychiatrist in an effort to dig up dirt on the whistleblower who was responsible at the time for the single largest leak of classified information in U.S. history. I&#8217;m talking about the Pentagon Papers. The man responsible for that leak was Daniel Ellsberg. He was a former senior defense analyst who had worked in a sensitive position at the Rand Corporation during the Vietnam War.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> Nixon didn&#8217;t like this man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>President Richard Nixon:\u003c/strong> What Ellsberg really boils down to, the man, the discrediting and all the rest, what it boils down to: I didn&#8217;t want to discredit the man as an individual. I couldn&#8217;t care less about the punk. I wanted to discredit that kind of activity, which was despicable and damaging to the national interest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> By the way, as we reported recently, the Trump Administration has been listening to pitches about creating its own private security force to circumvent the CIA and other intelligence agencies. And it&#8217;s also obsessed, like Nixon, with stopping leaks and there are at least 27 active leak investigations going on right now. Anyway, Dan Ellsberg is famous for the Pentagon Papers but he has a new book out that tells the story of the other classified files that Ellsberg took at the time, but never actually leaked or published. And those dealt with U.S. plans for nuclear war in the 1960s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ellsberg is now telling that story in his great new book. It&#8217;s called, &#8220;The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Daniel Ellsberg joins me now. Dan, welcome to Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Daniel Ellsberg:\u003c/strong> Very glad to be with you, Jeremy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What&#8217;s your assessment of where we are right now with Trump and how it compares to some of the history that you yourself lived.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> Right now, Trump is making threats of nuclear weapons, which is not a first with him. All of our presidents actually have used our nuclear weapons the way you use a gun when you point it at someone&#8217;s head in an encounter. And if you get your way without pulling the trigger, it&#8217;s the best use of the gun, that&#8217;s why people have them a lot.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump is using his nuclear weapons right now, for that matter, as is Kim Jong-un, but the difference is that this is the first time in over half a century, it&#8217;s the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, 55 years ago, when an American president is making threats of imminent nuclear action against a nuclear weapons state. In the Cuban Missile Crisis, that was true, but most of our threats, as Nixon&#8217;s against North Vietnam, which was a secret he was trying to keep me from revealing, actually, when he hired the Plumbers and sent them after me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> The White House had formed its own Bureau of Investigation — an illegal organization called the Plumbers. It was the Plumbers who had broken into Ellsberg psychiatrist&#8217;s office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> His threats against North Vietnam were against an ally of the Soviet Union, but not against the nuclear weapon state. The danger, now, is that as in the Cuban Missile Crisis, although we&#8217;re not confronting a superpower like the Soviet Union or Russia and there&#8217;s not a danger of nuclear winter because North Korea is the one member of the nine nuclear weapon states that doesn&#8217;t have enough weapons to cause a nuclear winter that would kill billions by starvation. Even without using nuclear weapons in their artillery against Seoul, and if they do use nuclear weapons in the course of escalation, we&#8217;d see more violence in a day or a week than the world has ever seen in that period of time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, they&#8217;re playing, again, as in the Cuban Missile Crisis, chicken, nuclear chicken — and yes, it is very dangerous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Given this book and the work that you are now revealing to the world about your knowledge of the nuclear program and the work that you did on it, that, in some ways, I think, you know contains some more individually explosive observations as any one paragraph of the Pentagon Papers, it&#8217;s really extraordinary what you&#8217;ve pulled together here. How dangerous is Trump compared to any other president from Truman to now, on this issue of nuclear weapons and the first-strike policy?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> Really what he says about it is not very new. When he says they should always be on the table, I would never —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DJT:\u003c/strong> &#8220;I would never take any of my cards off the table.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Chris Matthews:\u003c/strong> How about Europe?

Of course, Trump is worrisome because he seems so erratic, impulsive, thin-skinned. I&#8217;m not sure that he&#8217;s crazier than a number of other presidents. In fact, to tell the truth, I have come to believe that he&#8217;s not crazy, he&#8217;s just an asshole and that he&#8217;s catering to that in a certain segment of the population who admires him for precisely that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I think that Trump&#8217;s apparent look of craziness has attracted people&#8217;s attention to dangers that really were always there, and the system that he has command of, all together, the strategic system which he is rebuilding at the cost over thirty years of more than a trillion dollars, a program that was, after all, launched under Barack Obama and he&#8217;s continuing it and claims to be even increasing it, if that were actually set into motion not just rhetorically, and by making the kind of use he is making now of pointing the gun but actually pulling the trigger, that would kill nearly everyone on earth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, no one person, whether it&#8217;s Trump or anyone else, should have that power and strictly speaking, I mean very literally speaking, no nation should have that power. And two have it now in terms of killing everyone. India and Pakistan alone, together, without even using thermonuclear weapons, with their fission weapons, the kind that North Korea has, a war between them would starve by nuclear winter killing harvests for the smoke that blocks out the sunlight, would starve up to two billion people, a third of the world&#8217;s population. They don&#8217;t have a right to have that capability.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You know, it&#8217;s so deeply embedded in our culture in the United States, this sort of revisionist history of World War II, that the United States heroically got involved in World War II after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States led the fight that ultimately defeated Hitler and fascism, and that the definitive action that crushed Japan as a major ally of the fascists in Europe was the not one, but two uses of nuclear weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now, what&#8217;s always absent from that is the support that the United States gave to fascism, you know, in the 1930s, the refusal to aid those who are trying to stop the rise of fascism in Spain, what do you say to people who say we had to use the nuclear bomb during World War II. It brought a swift end to that bloody war.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> They&#8217;ve been lied to. They&#8217;re ignorant of the actual context of the bomb, which, by the way, was not threatened, it was just used as a fait accompli in an attack on a war which our leaders understood was very possibly going to end without it at the time of the entry of the Soviet Union, which was scheduled to be either on August 15 or they moved it up to August 8.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster\u003c/strong>: On the 8th day of August, three days after the one in which the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, the Soviet Union declared War on the Japanese Empire. This participation had long been expected by the leaders of the Big Three. In April, at the Yalta Conference, Marshal Stalin assured President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, that following the surrender of Germany, Russia would end the war in the Pacific.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> And that that was likely to make the Japanese ready to surrender on the terms we wanted. But, that, of course, brought the bomb into the world under the most attractive, you know, the only, what seemed like justifying auspices. It was an American weapon, rather than a fascist weapon, although it, in its nature, is the essence of fascism and its ruthlessness and indiscriminate killing of civilians — which, however, we had come to imitate in our strategic bombing program during the war, the British and the Americans, actually went further than Hitler in seeing our air war as a war against civilians above all. And that was a crucial basis for the nuclear era that followed with nuclear weapons that really can&#8217;t discriminate between a military target and its surrounding civilians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the idea was then that this bomb had come in and had been necessary to avoid invasion. That was not true in the eyes of nearly all of the leaders at the time. The American public was not aware of the communications we had intercepted between the Imperial headquarters and their own diplomats abroad, and the Soviet Union, which showed that they were willing to surrender. They were not planning to fight to the death.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, the public didn&#8217;t know that. So, the bomb looked like a miraculous savior of American lives, even Japanese lives in the end, and that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s seemed ever since. That was a very dangerous opening to the nuclear era for the United States to believe that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> You&#8217;re famous the world over for so-called Pentagon Papers, but this book tells the story of other documents that you were going to reveal to the world that deal with U.S. nuclear war planning, notes that you took on that program, various studies that were done of classified information.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, lay out, basically the story that you&#8217;re telling in this book about the bomb.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> I was first going to put out the Pentagon Papers on Vietnam, where the bombs were actually falling at the time. And then, what I thought it was the more important information about the preparations for nuclear war that I&#8217;ve been part of, and that I was privy to, I was going to do that after my trial or two. I mean, the first trial was just for copying the Pentagon Papers, not for distributing. I mean, that alone, faced me with 115 years in prison, 12 felony accounts. Which, oh, I gave them to my brother to say, &#8220;Put them out.&#8221; He buried them in a trash dump in Tarrytown, New York, and had a green iron stove on top of the bluff where he&#8217;d buried them to mark the spot so he could recapture them. Hurricane Doria, Tropical Storm Doria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ed Herlihy:\u003c/strong> A furious lady named Doria, first hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland this season, batters the Eastern seaboard from North Carolina to New Jersey.

But a lot of that material has been declassified since.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> I think this is incredible. So, your brother buries them, then a hurricane whips through, blows the stove away, and disperses the ground, so you never actually were able to go back and find any of those documents?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> Well they went back and looked, weekend after weekend, actually, for a year and a half. They turned up a lot of green garbage bags in which the box with these papers was, which encompassed it, but none with, they found, with top secret documents in it. In the end, actually, they found that the trash and the ground from that trash heap was being used as fill for a condominium elsewhere, and — my brother — and then concrete is going to be poured over it. So he said, only dynamite, you know, could get it now and that wouldn&#8217;t preserve the documents very well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Little do the residents of that building know that they are living on top of some of Daniel Ellsberg&#8217;s most explosive secrets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> True.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> [Laughs.] So walk us through what you&#8217;ve laid out in this book and what it&#8217;s based on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> If war occurred with any conflict with the Soviet Union, this was Eisenhower&#8217;s emphasis that there should be no planning because it cost too much for any kind of limited war with the Soviet Union, only all-out war, and that would target every city in the Soviet Union and China, no matter how the war started over Berlin or an uprising in Eastern Europe, or whatever. So that is what has existed all this time and the reason that would have, by the way, killed everyone, is not from the immediate effects or from the radiation, the fall out, pretty much confined to the northern hemisphere, it would be from the smoke, from the burning cities which the firestorm caused by the attacks, would loft smoke and soot by the millions of tons into the stratosphere where it wouldn&#8217;t burn out, and it would envelop the globe in a cloud of smoke and soot that we now know would last for a decade, lowering temperatures because it would block the sunlight 70 percent of the sunlight and kill all the harvests worldwide.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And nearly everyone would starve to death.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Were there specific projections on the number of deaths that that scenario would cause?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> At that time, we didn&#8217;t know about nuclear winter. Now, I was working on the war plans in 1961, &#8217;62, and the concept of nuclear winter arising from this lofted smoke did not arise for another 20 years until 1983.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> Their purpose was to discuss new work by atmospheric scientists which predicts that the climate of the Earth could change dramatically after a nuclear war with weeks or months of darkness and intense cold.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster: \u003c/strong>It must come at no surprise to my colleagues in the Soviet Union, namely that a very large group of prominent biologists in the United States presented with the scenario —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> And even then, it was doubted for quite a while and much confirmed just in the last ten years but at that time, rather than thinking that our plans would kill nearly everyone, the answer to the question that I drafted which was given by the president, Kennedy, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff was how many would our plans kill if they were carried out as planned. And the answer then was not nearly everyone, it was 600 million people over a matter of months. There would be a fifth of the world&#8217;s population, but that was an underestimate at that time, including that and including Russian retaliation at that time. You was certainly talking over a billion people in a war that we had initiated as a nuclear war, as an escalation or a preemption, 600 hundred million: A hundred Holocausts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I was just stunned that the Joint Chiefs not only knew that, but were willing to say it to the president unapologetically, without resigning, and just say, &#8220;Yes, when you give the command or if we think you would give the command, if you had the ability, if there was time, if the communications were in and everything, we would launch a war that would kill 100 Holocausts.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I thought, &#8220;This is evil and insane.&#8221; There came to be, since that time, our own first strike would not really be better for our society, for our survival than a second strike. And that&#8217;s been true: in other words all the weapons we&#8217;re buying in order to limit damage to make credible our threats of initiating nuclear war, which we&#8217;re doing right now, and we were doing under Obama and now under Trump. And the Russian weapons that Putin has been buying, he&#8217;s spending a trillion dollars over the next 30 years, too, in the same kinds of weapons like ours: parity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In each case, both of us now are making first use threats. The Russians didn&#8217;t used to do that because they had a conventional superiority in Europe; they don&#8217;t now. So, they&#8217;re making the kinds of threats Eisenhower depended on. So, both sides are threatening insane acts, in acts that they now know would kill nearly everyone. It&#8217;s the system that is not only threatening crazy action: it is crazy. And that doesn&#8217;t depend on whether it&#8217;s Trump or not. Yes, it&#8217;s more worrisome even under Trump than under some others. But it&#8217;s a marginal thing. The fact is that the system is insane.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Of the countries that we&#8217;re talking about that actually have nuclear weapons, what country, in your view, seems most likely to consider actively using a nuclear weapon in the near future?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>DE:\u003c/strong> Trump seems to be prepared to provoke that action, if possible, by making Kim Jong-un think that he&#8217;s on the verge of being attacked or conceivably might attack first himself. I think it&#8217;s doubtful Trump&#8217;s generals would encourage him or even support him very much in initiating nuclear war, though that&#8217;s not impossible, but I think more likely they&#8217;ll say let Kim initiate the nuclear war, and then we&#8217;ll annihilate North Korea, and then we&#8217;ll show what a monster Kim is by using nuclear weapons against South Korea or Japan or possibly the U.S., with a weapon on a boat, that he sends over in retaliation to being assassinated, which we&#8217;re rather openly planning to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, right now, then, both sides are preparing for nuclear war. But the ultimate effect, I think, by the way of a war with Korea, the effects on South Korea and Japan, would be the renewal of testing by everyone. India and Pakistan would get thermonuclear weapons which they don&#8217;t have now. There would be new expansions of the arms race by everybody: China, France, along with us, and Russia. The Cold War I think would then be back irreversibly, and the chance of getting out of this situation would be nil for a generation or more.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, we are at a very climactic moment, and Trump is the president who actually has committed himself to a goal, which is entirely unachievable, which is the denuclearization of North Korea. That&#8217;s not going to happen now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Kim Jong-un has reason to believe, with our publicity about assassination squads, decapitation exercises, of invading North Korea, he&#8217;s not going to let go of the nuclear weapons he does have. He thinks he would be crazy to do that. And that&#8217;s not the kind of crazy he is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The kind of crazy he is, is like us in thinking that he would do better to go first than second in such a situation and our chances of surviving the nuclear age another 70 years, another 100 or 200 years, is low. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s zero.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My life is devoted to trying to raise those very low risks a little higher. I hope to awaken them to the fact that we are sleepwalking toward an abyss.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Well, and we all thank you for that, Daniel Ellsberg.

Bannon has been in the far-right trenches for years and he&#8217;s also a quite prolific filmmaker. Now, you may not be familiar with such films as, &#8220;In the Face of Evil: Reagan&#8217;s War in Word and Deed&#8221; or &#8220;Torchbearer,&#8221; which chronicles the gripping tale of the so-called duck commander Phil Robertson destroying the absurdity of life without God.

So, a lot of people have heard now because it&#8217;s a bigger name thing that he has produced some films that are better known in Hollywood — Titus Andronicus and stuff like that. But not a lot of people know that he&#8217;s also a director—or, as he would correct you immediately, writer-director, it&#8217;s really important to him that you get the writer part in there.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He has written and directed nine documentaries that are basically all about pushing a right-wing agenda. And a lot of people haven&#8217;t seen those films and they&#8217;re not hidden but they&#8217;re not so easily available. And my filmmaking partner Jeff Reichert wrote a piece for Film Comment about these films and had to sort of go through the torture of watching all these films and we thought it&#8217;s great to have written a piece about it but we need to share his vision with the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Give some examples of the kinds of documentary films that Steve Bannon made.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s made a biopic about Ronald Reagan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Ronald Reagan:\u003c/strong> Let&#8217;s set the record straight: there&#8217;s no argument over the choice between peace and war.

There isn&#8217;t always a great correlation between the subject matter and the images that he&#8217;s using. It&#8217;s extremely confusing.

I mean what he&#8217;s primarily using is this free stock footage material over and over. Sometimes we&#8217;ll see repeated images. He loves things like a stock footage image of money piling up, to show you that the economy&#8217;s in trouble and you should be stressed out about it. Sort of these, these rushed, harried images in and of themselves and then his technique of using many of them, sort of pummeling you with these images does create agitation and anxiety.

It&#8217;s a very disturbing worldview, honestly. And that&#8217;s where the explosions come in and the dinosaurs come in. It&#8217;s the extreme visual for what should be a more measured conversation around how the world is working right now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sometimes disturbing and specific ways that you see across the films, that I find personally very upsetting, so, for example, he uses images of, archival images of black civil rights movements, and then through the music or through what the commentator is saying in voiceover over those images, suggesting that those are instances of revolt or chaos.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&#8217;s so problematic to show images of black people protesting for equal rights and suggest that&#8217;s the nation going to cede.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Right, it reminds me right reminds me a little bit of Dave Chappelle&#8217;s alternate vision of history when he goes back in time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Dave Chappelle:\u003c/strong> George Washington&#8217;s the worst of the worst.

George Washington!&#8221; [Audience laughs.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Depending on your frame of reference, history can be either violent, chaotic or freedom fighters, and clearly Steve Bannon believes that black people fighting for their rights, they&#8217;re agents of chaos, not fighting for what rightfully should be theirs. Leni Riefenstahl, the sort of official filmmaker of the rise of the Nazi party, was actually a good filmmaker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> Yeah.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Steve Bannon does not appear to be, even though he seems to be in that same spirit of the point of Leni Riefenstahl&#8217;s films, does not seem to be a good filmmaker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> That is sort of the fun part of making this film is playing with that tension of what his grandiose dreams were for these films versus how they measure up artistically, and in terms of who was watching them. They were not huge box office successes and he wasn&#8217;t thinking of himself as an independent filmmaker or even somebody who was just speaking to his party him, making films for his friends and family. He thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to change the world with these movies.&#8221; And it wasn&#8217;t quite the right platform for him yet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Explain how the story of this film is told and how the focus group came into being and what they studied.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> Sure. So, the more we started working with the material from Bannon&#8217;s films, we realized, you know, what we&#8217;re trying to do is essentially paint a portrait of this person through their work in a way that you couldn&#8217;t necessarily see if you hadn&#8217;t had the cinematic experience of living in those little pieces of his soul. We also came to the conclusion that it was kind of opening us up to a very easy criticism, that, you know, you&#8217;re filmmakers, you&#8217;re film elites, like these films aren&#8217;t made for you, so what could you understand about them?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And we thought what do other people actually think about these films? What do people who are pretty extremely right wing think about these films and what are they absorbing on — not just from the politics. Do they even understand the politics that are in these films or are they just completely confounding to them as well? And we found that to be the case. Like, we wanted to put together a focus group that was pretty representative of not just a New York environment but the range of sort of political-leaning, diversity in age, race, etc., and found that most of these people even when they explicitly agreed with the politics in the films still thought it was ludicrous or offensive on a regular basis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member:\u003c/strong> I was like, scared. I was like almost about to close my eyes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member:\u003c/strong> I&#8217;m not sure what the point of it was. You know, if the point was to shock, yeah, I was shocked. But to what end?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member:\u003c/strong> The editing was horrible. The shots were horrible. The distortions were extremely distorted. That was Breitbart, all through the movies. And he’s been dead quite a while now, too, by the way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Andrew Breitbart:\u003c/strong> That&#8217;s what they got out of all of the blood, sweat, tears and rapes —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> For the people that may have agreed with the message of it, give some examples of the kinds of feedback that the focus group gave about Steve Bannon&#8217;s films.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> So, for example, there&#8217;s a woman that you see in the focus group who&#8217;s in the film who is on board with him making the comparison between a dinosaur and Nancy Pelosi. She likes that visual metaphor.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member:\u003c/strong> Were they comparing Democrats to t-rexes?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mediator:\u003c/strong> Well, I don&#8217;t know, were they?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member:\u003c/strong> I mean, I think — I think so.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member:\u003c/strong> Dinosaur. Nancy Pelosi. Do I need to say more?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mediator:\u003c/strong> Is that what they were trying to say?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member\u003c/strong>: Do I need to say more?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> But also kept talking about how the comparisons that were being made made no sense, even if she believed it to be true. So she, you know, cited comparing World War — the Holocaust with 9/11, and the idea that, see, we&#8217;re always under attack from some sort of foreign enemy. She couldn&#8217;t go along with that despite her politics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Mediator: \u003c/strong>Anybody else?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Focus Group Member: \u003c/strong>I did not like the comparison to the World Trade Center and the Holocaust.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> So, she didn&#8217;t like that comparison, but liked the dinosaur-Nancy Pelosi comparison?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> Yeah, she was a fan of that. We wanted to include that there were moments of connection for people in these films, but —\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Sounds like there was something for everyone in this focus group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> And the repeated question was like, &#8220;What is this even about?&#8221; Like we wondered at times if we should set it up differently so that instead of just showing the clip, we say this is supposed to be a movie about Ronald Reagan, a movie that&#8217;s supposed to be about health care, and yet you&#8217;re watching like Humpty Dumpty on a wall fall over and then Bigfoot running through the forest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Did the people in the focus group know that what they were watching were clips of Steve Bannon&#8217;s films?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> No. So, we told them nothing — they knew that they would be watching a series of film clips. I think that there was a sort of ad for the, to bring in those people, they said it was sort of a conversation around documentary film and propaganda, what that line is. And we told them nothing about who made the films or who we were. And there was a really funny moment at the end of the focus group when the moderator reveals that the films were made by Steve Bannon. And everyone&#8217;s sort of shell-shocked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then they ask about who the client is, and one of the women said, &#8220;Is it — is it Breitbart? Have we been doing this for Breitbart?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> What did you learn about Steve Bannon from watching every single Steve Bannon production?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> Oh god. I feel like I live inside his headspace. It&#8217;s about how extreme his world view is. That is what I think is useful about the films is that they&#8217;re very explicit. Like, even if he&#8217;s not saying those words, even if he&#8217;s hiding behind a narrator or Andrew Breitbart as the narrator, it&#8217;s a vision of the apocalypse. That&#8217;s the world he thinks we live in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Steve Bannon, it appears, is heading back to Sirius Radio Network to once again resume his talk show. What&#8217;s your reaction to that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> He&#8217;s got his hands on his weapons. This was challenging in making a film in which you&#8217;re trying to accomplish two things: to both warn people and say &#8220;don&#8217;t dismiss this person,&#8221; but also take a moment to appreciate their failures.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And that&#8217;s how I feel about his continued movement. We can sort of laugh about it or say that, you know, he&#8217;s a little bit of a ridiculous figure but ultimately he&#8217;s still in a position of power. Radio is what put him in the greatest position of power. And the purpose of revisiting the films isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s what&#8217;s most successful, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s hidden says so much about him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> Farihah, thank you so much for joining us on Intercepted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FZ:\u003c/strong> Thank you for having me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>JS:\u003c/strong> &#8220;American Carnage&#8221; was directed and produced by Farihah Zaman and Jeff Reichert.

But on their last record, 2016&#8217;s American band, the Drive-By Truckers looked outward towards the impending U.S. presidential election. Like a lot of Americans, they were shocked by the results.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We spoke to Patterson Hood, one of the principal songwriters and front men of Drive-By Truckers about his Alabama roots and how the current political climate has shaped his songwriting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Patterson Hood:\u003c/strong> Patterson Hood. I play in a band called Drive-By Truckers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I grew up in this place called Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Actually, a town called Florence, it&#8217;s part of the shoals area in northwest Alabama. Muscle Shoals has had this very infamous history in music and in music history, and my dad is part of that. He was a member of what&#8217;s called the Muscle Shoals Sound Rhythm Section, also known as The Swampers. [Music.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They&#8217;re four white guys, they all grew up in that area, and from like 1966 onward, he&#8217;s played on records by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Paul Simon, as well as Willie Nelson and Bobby Womack, Sam and Dave, Rod Stewart, Bob Seeger. I mean you name it, it goes on and on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I grew up in the, you know, in that post-Civil Rights South just after the assassination of Martin Luther King and the integration of the schools. They integrated my elementary school a year before I started first grade, so I kind of grew up amidst all of that. I kind of grew up in this part of the opposition always, because my dad&#8217;s a musician. My dad hated George Wallace and so I grew up in a house where he was viewed as this, you know, horrific person who claimed to represent us and didn&#8217;t, you know, and was an embarrassment to us.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> The University of Alabama campus at Tuscaloosa is under a tight security guard of State Police, as Governor George Wallace appeals for calm and prepares to confront a deputy U.S. attorney.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The federal officers are armed with a proclamation from President Kennedy urging the governor to end his average to prevent two Negro students from registering at the university. The governor is adamant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Governor George Wallace:\u003c/strong> As governor and chief magistrate of the State of Alabama, I deem it to be my solemn obligation and duty to stand before you, representing the rights and sovereignty of this state and its peoples.

And now they&#8217;ve got Roy Moore down there who&#8217;s doing a really good job of making the South look barbaric and backwards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Senator Roy Moore:\u003c/strong> Scientists who study evolution come up with some the oddest things, don&#8217;t they? [Audience laughs.] They tell us we evolved from something that crawled out of the water, but they have no evidence of that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PH:\u003c/strong> I started writing songs when I was eight and I wrote every day, and my grades went to crap, and about halfway through 3rd grade, all of a sudden, I became like this really terrible student and I never really bounced back because I just kept doing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Right after that, punk happened, and all of a sudden it was like The Clash and Elvis Costello, and, Blondie and, you know, just different people I would hear, you know? Whatever punk artist I would get to hear about in Muscle Shoals Alabama, which wasn&#8217;t exactly the East Village, you know? [Laughs.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Southern Rock Opera started out as a conversation between me and a friend of mine, a buddy of mine from back home. We were driving from Athens, Georgia in like a rented truck and somehow we started like brainstorming this idea of the story behind the band Lynyrd Skynyrd would make a very interesting narrative to make a movie about. It was a fun thing to talk about in a U-Haul truck for a few hours, for the six-hour drive back home and we went as far as like, a week later, actually drawing an outline of the story and then I got busy forming what became Drive-By Truckers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;The Three Alabama Icons&#8221; by Drive-By Truckers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PH:\u003c/strong> And then George Wallace died, and all of a sudden it was everywhere on the news, it was all the footage that I&#8217;d grown up seeing of him standing in the doorways of schools, and fire hoses, and police dogs, and Bull Connor, and all that bullshit, you know, and I was just kind of mortified watching it all again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Newscaster:\u003c/strong> He was a presidential candidates and four-term governor, yet George Wallace will probably always be remembered by the words: &#8220;Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.&#8221; He died last night of cardiac arrest.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PH:\u003c/strong> And, all of a sudden, it occurred to me that while this is part of this other thing we&#8217;re talking about. Actually this is all, this is all one thing. And Wallace was just this idealistic lawyer and judge who then basically played the segregation card in order to get power. Because he thought he could then use the power to help people. But, of course, you know, that&#8217;s the evil.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;The Three Alabama Icons&#8221; by Drive-By Truckers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PH:\u003c/strong> The same state that is famous for the police dogs and the, you know, schoolhouse stance, also gave the world some of the greatest soul music of all time, and a lot of the musicians on those soul records were these white dudes, these redneck boys that grew up, you know, in my hometown, including my dad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I don&#8217;t buy into the argument of, you know, it&#8217;s “heritage not hate.” That may be that person&#8217;s intent with his personal flag, but there&#8217;s no removing what the flag has stood for, for a lot of people and continues to for a lot of people, and you&#8217;re just being naive if you don&#8217;t accept that as part of what it&#8217;s become and what it is.

He had actually had been a neighbor where I&#8217;d lived and he lived with his mom and, it was a really horrific story that had a lot of parallels to what&#8217;s been going on. And, I sat at my kitchen table and wrote the majority of it one afternoon just as a — trying to make, make some kind of sense at least of my own thoughts about it. And the song basically just asked a bunch of questions because it didn&#8217;t really offer any answers, but it was my way of trying to deal with it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then things kind of kept happening, and I played the song for the band and they really embraced it, and then it kind of wrote itself: it&#8217;s like things just kept happening.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[&#8220;What It Means&#8221; by Drive-by Truckers]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PH:\u003c/strong> I didn&#8217;t even try to write a song for years.
